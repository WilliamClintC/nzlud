Chapter 1.14 NOTICE OF MEETINGS

Sections:

1.14.010    Purpose and application.

1.14.060    Notice – Adjourned meetings.

1.14.070    Notice – Work sessions.


1.14.010 Purpose and application.

It is the purpose of this chapter to set out standards for notice of meetings of public bodies of the City that exceed those required by AS 44.62.310. The provisions of this chapter apply unless more stringent requirements of an ordinance or law are specifically applicable to a particular body. It is the intent of the City Council that notice given of the meetings of public bodies always meet the minimum requirements of the State statute but that a reasonable effort should be made to exceed the minimum statutory requirements. This chapter applies to notice of meetings of the City Council and all commissions, boards, committees, subcommittees, task forces and any sub-unit of the foregoing public bodies of the City, whether meeting in a formal or informal meeting. The failure to give the notice provided for under this chapter does not invalidate or otherwise affect any action or decision of a public body of the City; however, this sentence does not change the consequences of failing to give the minimum notice required under State statute. Notice will ordinarily be given by the City Clerk. The presiding officer or the person or persons calling a meeting are responsible for notifying the City Clerk of meetings in sufficient time for the Clerk to publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. [Ord. 89-1(A) § 2, 1989].


1.14.020 Notice – Regular meetings.

Notice of regular meetings of a public body of the City may be given by the adoption by the City Council of an ordinance or resolution setting out the days of each month and the time and place of the regular meetings of the body. In addition to, or instead of, notice given by ordinance or resolution, notice of a regular meeting may be given by publication once in a newspaper of a general circulation not less than three days before the date of the meeting. [Ord. 89-1(A) § 2, 1989].


1.14.030 Notice – Special meetings.

Notice of special meetings of any public body of the City may be given by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation at least three days before the date of the meeting or as provided in HCC 1.14.040. [Ord. 89-1(A) § 2, 1989].


1.14.040 Alternate notice – Special meetings.

Instead of the published notice provided for under HCC 1.14.030, notice may be given by:

a. Broadcast by local radio at least twice a day for three consecutive days before the day of the meeting or for two consecutive days before the day of the meeting plus the day of the meeting. [Ord. 89-1(A) § 2, 1989].


1.14.050 Notice – Emergency and urgent meetings.

If the presiding officer or the members of a body calling a special meeting determine that an emergency exists or that a situation requiring action or consideration by the body is required before the notice provided for under HCC 1.14.030 can be given, the standards of HCC 1.14.030 may be relaxed, but notice of the meeting should be broadcast as soon as possible and be repeated at least two additional times before the meeting. [Ord. 89-1(A) § 2, 1989].


1.14.060 Notice – Adjourned meetings.

If a public body of the City is unable to complete the work on its agenda at a regular or special meeting, it may adjourn the meeting to another time or day prior to the next regular meeting of the body for the sole purpose of completing the work on its agenda. The day and time to which to adjourn shall be fixed by the adoption of a motion at or prior to adjournment of the regular or special meeting. At the adjourned meeting the body shall take up its work at the point where it was interrupted in the order of business. No further notice of the adjourned meeting is required but it is recommended that if time permits notice of the adjourned meeting be broadcast by local radio as soon as possible and be repeated two additional times before the meeting. [Ord. 92-42 § 1, 1992].


1.14.070 Notice – Work sessions.

A work session is a special meeting of a public body of the City called to enable the body to devote special time and effort to one or more enumerated subjects. The body may discuss and consider suggestions concerning the subject of the session, and take public input if it so desires, but it shall take no formal action. A work session may be called by presiding officer of the body, or by a majority of the body. Because no formal action may be taken at a work session, the standards of HCC 1.14.030 may be relaxed, but notice of the session should be broadcast as soon as possible and be repeated at least two additional times before the work session. [Ord. 92-42 § 2, 1992].

1.18.010 Purpose.

a. The proper functioning of democratic government requires ethical behavior by public officials. Ethics involves the commitment to take individual responsibility in creating a government that has the trust and respect of its citizens. The purpose of this chapter is to set reasonable standards of conduct for City officials and the City Manager so that the public may be assured that its trust in such persons is well placed and that the City officials and the City Manager themselves are aware of the standards of conduct demanded.

b. However, recognizing that Homer is a small community, with a limited number of people interested in serving as community leaders, it is not the intent of this chapter to set unreasonable barriers that will serve only to deter aspirants from public service.

c. This chapter also defines conflict of interest and partiality, the standards stating when and to whom it applies, and the procedures for declaration and the proper action of the body when possible conflicts and partiality arise.

d. This chapter is also intended to establish a process which will ensure that complaints or inquiries regarding the conduct of City officials and the City Manager are resolved in the shortest practicable time in order to protect the rights of the public at large and the rights of the City and the City Manager.

e. The City Council intends this code to be interpreted to promote fair, honest, and impartial dealings with members of the public, to ensure proper use of City resources, and to avoid conflicts of interest.

f. This chapter does not create or prevent a private cause of action against any person, City official, or the City Manager. [Ord. 08-24(S-2)(A), 2008].

g. Use of Office for Personal Gain. No City official or the City Manager shall seek office or position or use their office or position for the purpose of obtaining anything of value for themselves, an immediate family member or a business that they own or in which they hold an interest, or for the purpose of influencing any matter in which they have a financial interest.

k. Outside Activities. A City official or the City Manager may not engage in business or accept employment with, or render services for, a person other than the City or hold any office or position where that activity, office, or position is incompatible with the proper discharge of the official’s or City Manager’s City duties or would tend to impair the official’s or the City Manager’s independence of judgment in performing City duties. This prohibition shall include but not be limited to the following activities:

1. A person who holds an appointed City office on a board or commission shall not be eligible for employment with the City in the department related to the board or commission during the official’s term of office and until one year has elapsed following the period of service.

2. A person who holds or has held an elective City office shall not be eligible for appointment to an office or for employment with the City during the official’s period of service and until one year has elapsed following the period of service.

This statement is only required when the person receives a beneficial substantial financial interest. If all other provisions of this chapter are complied with, the statement shall be sufficient for continuing transactions of a similar or like nature for one year from the date of its filing. However, if an official has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, he shall be precluded from engaging in business with the City on that particular matter for one year.

b. Upon taking office or upon subsequently acquiring the interest, an official shall, within 10 days, file with the City Clerk a statement disclosing any substantial financial interests of the official or the City Manager in any existing business with the City, including those of any organization in which the official or the City Manager has a substantial financial interest.

b. The financial interest disclosure must be filed by November 1st each year. A newly appointed official must file a statement within 30 days after taking office. Each candidate for elected City office must file a disclosure statement at the time he or she files a declaration of candidacy, except an incumbent seeking reelection with a current disclosure statement on file. Refusal or failure of a candidate to file the required disclosure statement before the end of the time period for filing declarations of candidacy shall require that the candidate’s declaration of candidacy be rejected and the candidate disqualified.

1.18.045 Procedure for declaring potential conflict of interest – City officials.

a. A City official who has or may have a substantial financial interest in an official action shall disclose the facts concerning that interest to the body of the City of which the official is a member prior to the body taking any official action. Any member of the body may raise a question concerning another member’s financial interests, in which case the member in question shall disclose relevant facts concerning the official’s financial interests in the subject of the action.

b. If the official is a City Council member, the Mayor, or the Mayor Pro Tem in the absence of the Mayor, shall rule on whether the Council member must be excused from participation or must vote. The ruling may be immediately overridden by a majority vote of the City Council. There is no appeal from the action or inaction of the City Council to override or not override the ruling of the Mayor.

c. If the official is not a City Council member, the official may excuse themselves without a vote for conflict of interest, otherwise the board, commission, or other body of which the official is a member shall by majority vote rule on whether the member must be excused from participation, which must be the ruling when the body determines the official has a substantial financial interest in the official action. There is no appeal from the ruling of the body.

d. The official shall abide by the ruling. If the official is not a City Council member, the ruling applies (without the need for further disclosures and rulings) to all subsequent occasions on which the same official action comes before the same body, unless there has been a material change of circumstances. On each such subsequent occasion, the presiding officer shall note for the minutes that the ruling previously made continues in effect.

e. An official who is ruled to be excused from participation shall leave the official table and not vote, debate, testify, or otherwise take part in the official action, except an official who is an applicant may testify on his or her own behalf from the public testimony area.

f. Rule of Necessity. Exceptions to a ruling excusing a member from participation shall be made in cases where:

1. By reason of being excused for conflicts of interest the number of members of the Council or other body eligible to vote is reduced to less than the minimum number required to approve the official action;

2. No other body of the City has jurisdiction and authority to take the official action on the matter; and

3. The official action cannot be set aside to a later date, within a reasonable time, when the body could obtain the minimum number of members to take action who are not excused for conflicts of interest.

When the body determines this exception applies, then all members, except the applicant when the applicant is a member of the body, shall participate in the official action. [Ord. 08-24(S-2)(A), 2008].


1.18.047 Procedure for declaring potential conflicts of interest – City Manager.

The City Manager who has or may have a substantial financial interest in an official action shall disclose the facts concerning the Manager’s financial interests to the City Council prior to taking any official action. If the City Council determines the Manager has a substantial financial interest in the action, the City Council shall excuse the Manager and assign another City employee to the matter. [Ord. 08-24(S-2)(A), 2008].


1.18.048 Procedure for declaring and ruling on partiality in quasi-judicial matters.

a. A City official or the City Manager who has partiality concerning a quasi-judicial matter shall not advise on matter, adjudicate the matter or serve as a member of a body adjudicating the matter.

b. A City official who is a member of a quasi-judicial body and who has or may have partiality concerning a matter to be adjudicated shall disclose the facts concerning the official’s possible partiality to the body to the parties to the matter prior to the commencement of proceedings by the body. Any member of the body, and any party to a matter before the body, may raise a question concerning a member’s partiality, in which case the member in question shall disclose facts concerning the official’s possible partiality in the matter.

c. After such disclosure, the City official may excuse themselves for partiality without a vote of the body, otherwise the body (including a body comprised of City Council members when serving in a quasi-judicial capacity) shall by majority vote rule on whether the member must be excused from participation, which must be the ruling when the body determines the official has partiality concerning the matter.

d. Rule of Necessity. Exceptions to a ruling excusing a member from participation shall be made in cases where:

1. By reason of being excused for partiality the number of members of the Council or other body eligible to vote is reduced to less than the minimum number required to approve the official action;

2. No other body of the City has jurisdiction and authority to take the official action on the matter; and

3. The official action cannot be set aside to a later date, within a reasonable time, when the body could obtain the minimum number of members to take action who are not excused for partiality.

When the body determines this exception applies, then all members, except the applicant when the applicant is a member of the body, shall participate in the official action.

e. The City Manager who has or may have partiality concerning a quasi-judicial matter over which the Manager has decision-making authority shall either (1) appoint another City employee to make the decision or (2) disclose the facts concerning the possible partiality to the City Council and to the parties to the matter prior to taking any official action. If referred to the City Council and the City Council determines the Manager has partiality concerning the matter, the City Council shall excuse the Manager and cause another City employee to be assigned to decide the matter.

b. All written complaints of potential violation submitted under this chapter shall be signed by the person submitting the complaint.

The person filing the complaint of potential violation shall identify the section of Chapter 1.18 HCC the person believes was violated, state why the person signing the complaint of potential violation believes the facts alleged constitute a violation of that section, and identify any documentary or testimonial evidence the person filing the complaint believes is in support of the notification of potential violation.

c. Written complaints of potential violations filed with the City Clerk’s office shall be reviewed in accordance with HCC 1.19.040. Except as otherwise provided in HCC 1.19.040, the Board of Ethics shall have sole jurisdiction to decide the merits of the complaint filed under this chapter.

1.19.040 Confidentiality – Initial review.

a. Each written complaint of a violation of Chapter 1.18 HCC received by the City Clerk’s office shall be assigned an identification number, which shall be used in lieu of names when referring to the complaint to maintain confidentiality. The City Clerk, City Attorney, and the Board or hearing officer shall keep all written complaints of potential violation confidential during investigation and the Board’s or hearing officer’s deliberative process. Complaints of potential violation may be disclosed only to the staff member of the City Clerk’s office providing administrative support to the Board or hearing officer, members of the Board except when a hearing officer has been appointed, and legal counsel.

b. Upon receipt of a notification of potential violation, the City Clerk shall review the complaint for completeness and inclusion of the information required in HCC 1.19.030(b). If the City Clerk determines that the complaint is not complete and lacks information required by HCC 1.19.030(b), the City Clerk shall return the complaint and identify in writing the deficiencies on which the return is based. The City Clerk shall notify the complainant of the return and the reasons for it. A person may amend and refile a complaint but a complaint filed by the same complainant with the same deficiencies shall not be accepted. The City Clerk may recommend to the person filing the complaint that it be amended and refiled. Notifications of potential violation returned without further action shall remain confidential.

c. The City Attorney shall review the sufficiency of the statement of violation in the complaint. If the City Attorney determines the facts alleged in the notification of potential violation, even if proven, do not constitute a violation, or that the Board or hearing officer lacks jurisdiction to address the complaint of potential violation, the City Attorney shall instruct the City Clerk to return the complaint and identify in writing the deficiencies on which the return is based. The City Clerk shall notify the complainant of the return and the reasons for it. A person may amend and refile a complaint but a complaint filed by the same complainant with the same deficiencies shall not be accepted. The City Clerk may recommend to the person filing the complaint that it be amended and refiled. Notifications of potential violation returned without further action shall remain confidential.

d. If the City Attorney determines the allegations in a complaint of potential violation, if proven, may constitute a violation of a matter within the Board or hearing officer’s jurisdiction, the City Attorney shall provide written notice to the City Clerk.

e. If the City Attorney and City Clerk find the complaint sufficient under this section, the City Clerk shall:

1. Retain a hearing officer as required under HCC 1.19.030(d) and provide that officer with a copy of the complaint of potential violation, a copy of the outline of the hearing officer process under this chapter, including notice that the respondent may choose to hold the proceeding in public and may be represented by legal counsel of respondent’s choosing and at respondent’s own expense; or

2. Provide the Board with a copy of the complaint of potential violation, a copy of the outline of the Board’s process under this chapter, including notice that the respondent may choose to hold the proceeding in public and may be represented by legal counsel of respondent’s choosing and at respondent’s own expense;

4. Notify both the person submitting the complaint of potential violation and respondent of the date(s) on which each may be requested to meet with the Board or hearing officer, present documentary or testimonial evidence, and assist the Board or hearing officer in resolving the potential violation.

1.19.050 Disclosure of complaint of potential violation prohibited.

a. A complaint of potential violation of Chapter 1.18 HCC is confidential until the Board or hearing officer completes a written report for distribution as a public record.

1. No person, including the complainant, shall knowingly disclose to another person, or otherwise make public in violation of this chapter, the contents of a complaint of potential violation filed with the Board or hearing officer, unless:

a. The respondent elects to proceed in public; or

b. The written report of the Board or hearing officer is electronically published by the City Clerk.

2. Breach of confidentiality required by any provision of this chapter is a violation of this chapter subject to punishment.

3. A person filing a complaint of potential violation shall keep confidential the fact that the person has filed the complaint with the City, as well as the contents of the complaint of potential violation. If the Board or hearing officer finds probable cause to believe that the person filing the notice of complaint violation has violated confidentiality under this chapter, the Board or hearing officer shall immediately dismiss the complaint of violation. Dismissal under this subsection does not affect the right of the Board or hearing officer or another person to initiate a proceeding on the same factual allegations by filing a complaint of potential violation.

4. Public disclosure resulting from corrective action under this chapter is not a violation of this section. [Ord. 18-14(A) § 5, 2018].


1.19.060 Conduct of investigation and standard of proof.

The Board’s investigation shall be conducted in executive session, unless the respondent requests to hold the Board’s investigation on the notification of potential violation in public. The hearing officer’s investigation shall be conducted in a manner to maintain confidentiality unless the respondent requests to hold the hearing officer’s investigation on the notification of potential violation in public.

a. The respondent and the person who filed the notification of potential violation may identify other individuals and documents that each would like the Board or hearing officer to interview and review.

b. If an individual with information bearing on the notification of potential violation is unwilling to come forward with information, the respondent and the person who filed the notification of potential violation may each request the Board or hearing officer to subpoena the person and any documentary evidence.

Consistent with due process, the Board or hearing officer may limit or prohibit questions suggested to the Board or hearing officer by or on behalf of persons appearing before the Board or hearing officer.

f. The standard of proof to be applied by the Board or hearing officer in determining a violation under this chapter is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.

g. Technical rules of evidence do not apply, but the findings of the Board shall be based upon reliable and relevant information presented to the Board.

h. The Board’s or hearing officer’s finding of a violation of this chapter must be supported by substantial evidence.

i. The Board’s or hearing officer’s findings shall not be binding in a subsequent sanctions proceeding.

The recording shall be available for access as a public record after publication by the Municipal Clerk of the proposed resolution and settlement. [Ord. 18-14(A) § 5, 2018].

At the sole discretion of the respondent, the Board or hearing officer may release the statement of closure as a public document. [Ord. 18-14(A) § 5, 2018].


1.19.090 Timely completion.

The Board or hearing officer shall complete action on a complaint of potential violation and investigations within 90 days of the filing of the complaint of potential violation. By a majority vote, the Board or hearing officer may extend the completion date for up to an additional 90 days, or longer for good cause shown. [Ord. 18-14(A) § 5, 2018].


1.19.100 Sanctions, civil penalties and remedies.

1. A recommendation to the City Council that the office of a City Council member or the position of City Manager be declared vacant for a serious violation that is (a) flagrant or (b) willful and knowing. A recommendation that the office of the Mayor be declared vacant may be made only if the violation justifies a declaration of vacancy under AS 29.20.280. Only the City Council may actually declare any of these positions vacant.

2. A member of a board or commission may be removed from the board or commission.

3. A public or private reprimand may be given to the official.

After such a disclosure, the other members of the Board shall determine whether a member shall be excused for cause.

b. A hearing officer shall disclose any conflict of interest or ex parte communications with the complainant or respondent before conducting an investigation or holding a hearing under this chapter. The complainant and the respondent have 10 days from the date the written disclosure is sent to the parties to file an objection to the hearing officer with the City Clerk.

1.19.120 Duty of cooperation.

A City official or the City Manager subject to a complaint of a violation shall work cooperatively with the City Clerk to establish a hearing date and shall appear at the place and time set for the hearing, regardless of the respondent’s intentions concerning defense or exercise of other rights. Failure to appear, except when failure results from a serious condition or event that prevented the respondent’s appearance, is a breach of respondent’s duties under this chapter and in itself may result in a summary finding of violation by the Board or hearing officer and imposition of remedies, penalties and disciplinary action under HCC 1.19.100. For the purposes of this section, a “serious condition or event” may include a serious medical condition, a serious family emergency requiring the presence of the party, a death in the family, or other similar cause that prevents the respondent’s attendance at the hearing. Nothing in this section shall prevent the rescheduling of a hearing for cause upon request of the respondent or the complainant. [Ord. 18-14(A) § 5, 2018].


1.19.130 Settlement of complaints.

a. The respondent in any case accepted for investigation may propose a resolution and settlement of the complaint. A proposed resolution and settlement will include the admitted violation of Chapter 1.18 HCC; the remedial actions agreed to by the respondent subject to the City Council’s concurrence; any proposed preventive actions to be undertaken to avoid similar violation by respondent or others in the future; and other matters required by the Board or hearing officer.

b. A proposed resolution and settlement are subject to approval by the Board or hearing officer and have no effect unless approved by the Board or hearing officer. The Board or hearing officer will give the complaining person the opportunity to review and comment on the proposed resolution and settlement prior to approving it. Until approved by the Board or hearing officer, a proposed resolution and settlement must be kept confidential.

c. The proposed resolution and settlement become public record upon final approval by the Board or hearing officer. [Ord. 18-14(A) § 5, 2018].


1.19.140 Record of proceedings and public record.

Permanent records and minutes shall be kept of Board’s or hearing officer’s proceedings. Such minutes shall record the vote of each member upon every question decided in public. Every decision or finding shall immediately be filed in the office of the City Clerk, and shall be a public record open to inspection by any person. Every finding and recommendation shall be directed to the City Council at the earliest possible date. [Ord. 18-14(A) § 5, 2018].

The ballot box then shall be closed and locked and shall not be opened again or removed from the polling place until the polls have closed.

b.    1. Before being allowed to vote, each voter shall exhibit to an election judge one form of identification, including but not limited to an official voter registration card, driver’s license, birth certificate, passport, or hunting or fishing license;

2. An election judge may waive the identification requirement if he knows the identity of the voter;

3. A voter who cannot exhibit a required form of identification shall be allowed to vote a questioned ballot.

c. The judges shall keep a register or registers in which each voter, before receiving his ballot, shall sign his name and give both his residence and mailing address. A record shall be kept in the registration book in the space provided of the name of the person who offered to vote but who actually did not vote, and a brief statement of explanation. The signing of the register constitutes a declaration by the voter that he is qualified to vote. If any election official present believes that the voter is not qualified, he shall immediately question the voter according to the procedure outlined in subsection (i)(1) of this section. If the voter’s polling place is in question, a voter shall be allowed to vote, and any election official shall consider the ballot as a questioned ballot.

d. When the voter is qualified to vote, the election judge shall give him an official ballot.

e. Each voter shall retire alone to a booth or private area to mark his ballot. If a voter is blind or otherwise physically unable to mark his ballot alone, he may request assistance and it may be permitted pursuant to AS 15.15.240. Immediately after marking the ballot, the voter shall place the ballot in the secrecy sleeve to conceal the manner in which the ballot is marked. In all cases the ballot shall be deposited in the ballot box by the voter himself, in the presence of the election judge, unless the voter requests the judge to deposit the ballot on his behalf.

f. If a voter improperly marks or otherwise damages a ballot, he shall return it to the election officials, concealing the manner in which it is marked, and shall request a new ballot. The election officials shall record and retain the ballot number and destroy the spoiled ballot. A new ballot shall be issued to the voter. A voter may request replacement of a spoiled ballot no more than three times.

g. Prohibiting the Count of Exhibited Ballots. No election official may allow a ballot to be placed in the ballot box which he knows to have been unlawfully exhibited by the voter. A ballot unlawfully exhibited shall be recorded and treated as a spoiled ballot.

h. Fifteen minutes before closing the polls, the time remaining before such closure shall be proclaimed. When the polls are closed for the purposes of voting, that fact shall likewise be proclaimed and thereafter no ballot shall be issued except to those voters who were present and waiting their turn to go through the voting procedure at the time prescribed for closing the polls.

i. Questioned Ballot Procedure.

1. Every elected official shall question, and every watcher and other person qualified to vote in the precinct may question a person attempting to vote if the questioner has good reason to suspect that the questioned person is not qualified to vote. All questions regarding the person’s qualifications to vote shall be made in writing, setting forth the reason for the challenge. A questioned person, before voting, shall provide the information required to vote a questioned ballot and shall subscribe to an oath and affidavit, provided by the Clerk on the questioned voter oath and affidavit envelope, attesting to the fact that in each particular case the person meets all the qualifications of a voter, that he is not disqualified, and that he has not voted previously at the same election. After the questioned person has taken the oath and signed the affidavit, the person may vote. If the questioned person refuses to provide the information required to vote a questioned ballot or refuses to take the oath or sign the affidavit, the person may not vote.

2. A questioned voter shall vote his ballot in the same manner as prescribed for other voters. Except that the questioned voter shall insert his ballot into the secrecy sleeve and then into the oath and affidavit envelope for questioned voters provided by the City Clerk. This envelope shall be sealed and deposited in the ballot box. When the ballot box is opened these envelopes shall be segregated for delivery to the counting center/election central along with the registration books or logs, etc. [Ord. 03-66 §§ 1, 2, 2003; Ord. 99-13 § 4, 1999; Ord. 95-1(S), 1995; Ord. 82-6 § 14, 1982].

4.20.040 Polls closing and ballot accounting.

a. Fifteen minutes before the closing of the polls, and at the time of closing the polls, an election official shall announce both the designated closing time and the actual time at which the announcement is made. Failure to make the announcement at 15 minutes before closing time shall not in any way invalidate the election or extend the time for closing of the polls. After closing, no person will be allowed to enter the polling place for purposes of voting. Every qualified voter present and in line at the time prescribed for closing the polls may vote.

b. When the polls are closed and the last vote has been cast, the election board shall account for all ballots by completing a ballot statement containing, in a manner prescribed by the Clerk, the number of official ballots supplied.

c. The election board shall count the number of questioned ballots and shall compare that number to the number of questioned voters in the register. Discrepancies shall be noted on the ballot statement.

4.35.010 Review of election documents by Canvass Board.

a. The Clerk shall, subject to confirmation of the City Council, appoint a Canvass Board of as many members as required to accomplish the canvass in reasonable time. All members of the election Canvass Board, before entering upon their duties, must subscribe to the oath required of all public officers by the Constitution of the State of Alaska in the manner prescribed by the Clerk. The Canvass Board will review the preliminary certificates of election and all official documents of the precinct election boards and the counting center boards.

b. Not later than the Monday following each election, the Canvass Board shall meet in public session and canvass all election returns. The Canvass Board may be recessed from day to day, but not more than three such recesses. In full view of those present, the election Canvass Board shall judge the applicability of absentee and questioned ballots, shall open and tally those accepted, and shall compile the total votes cast in the election. The canvass of ballots counted by the counting center shall be accomplished by reviewing the tallies of the recorded vote to check for mathematical error by comparing totals with the counting center logs and certificates of results. All obvious errors found by the election canvass in the transfer of totals from the precinct tally sheets to the precinct certificate of results shall be corrected by the Canvass Board. A mistake which has been made in precinct returns from the tallies to the certificate of results empowers the Canvass Board to recommend a recount of the results of the precinct or precincts for that portion of the returns in question.

c. To be counted in the election, an absentee ballot by mail must be postmarked by midnight of election day and received by the Clerk before the canvass. Envelopes of absentee ballots by mail received after that time shall not be opened, but shall be marked “invalid” with the date and hour of receipt noted thereon, and shall be retained with other ballots of the election. An absentee ballot that is returned by electronic transmission must be received by the Clerk not later than 8:00 p.m. on election day in order to be counted. When the Clerk receives a completed absentee ballot by electronic transmission, the Clerk will remove the ballot portion of the transmission from the portion that identifies the voter; place the ballot portion in a secrecy sleeve and seal the secrecy sleeve; place the sealed secrecy sleeve in an envelope of the type used for absentee ballots returned by mail and seal that envelope; attach the voter identification portion to the outer envelope; and forward the sealed outer envelope to the Canvass Board.

d. Questioned and absentee ballots shall be counted as follows: No questioned or absentee ballot by mail shall be counted if the voter has failed to properly execute the certificate, if the witness or the officer or other person authorized by law to administer the oath fails to affix his signature, or if the voter fails to enclose his marked ballot inside the small envelope or secrecy sleeve provided. No absentee ballot by electronic transmission shall be counted if the voter has failed to properly execute the certificate, or if the witness or the officer or other person authorized by law to administer the oath fails to affix his signature. The Clerk or a member of the election Canvass Board may challenge the name of an absentee voter if he has good reason to suspect that the voter is not qualified to vote, is disqualified, or has already voted at the same election. The person making the questioned ballot shall specify the basis of the challenge for the record. The Canvass Board, by majority vote, may refuse to accept the challenge and count the ballot of a person properly challenged. If the ballot is refused, the Clerk shall notify the challenged voter by letter within four weeks of the canvass. All rejected ballots shall be enclosed in a separate envelope and shall be labeled “rejected ballots” retained with other materials of the election. If the ballot is not rejected, the large envelope shall be opened, the small inner envelope or secrecy sleeve shall be placed in a container and mixed with other blank absentee ballot envelopes, or in the case of counting questioned ballots with other blank questioned ballot envelopes, the mixed small blank envelopes or secrecy sleeves shall be drawn from the container, opened, and the ballots counted according to the rules of determining properly marked ballots. [Ord. 16-01(A)(S) § 3, 2016; Ord. 12-22 § 6, 2012; Ord. 03-66 §§ 10, 11, 2003; Ord. 95-1(S), 1995; Ord. 90-42(A) § 3, 1990; Ord. 82-6 § 19, 1982].

5.16.020 Summary abatement.

a. Whenever the existence of a public nuisance, as defined in this chapter, comes to the attention of the Department, the Department may promptly cause to be inspected the property on which it is alleged that such public nuisance exists. Should the Department find that a public nuisance exists, and that the public health, safety or welfare may be in immediate danger, then summary abatement procedures shall be implemented and the Department may cause the nuisance to be removed or abated. The Department may notify the Building Inspector if the public nuisance involves a building that appears structurally unsafe. The Building Inspector, upon being notified by the Department, shall cause the building on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists to be inspected and submit a written report of such inspection and the findings to the Department.

b. When summary abatement is authorized, prior notice to the owner, agent or occupant of the property is not required, but will be attempted. Following summary abatement, the Department shall cause to be posted on the property liable for the abatement a notice describing the action taken to abate the nuisance. [Ord. 07-37(A) § 2, 2007].


5.16.030 Abatement in other cases – Notice, etc.

a. If, after inspecting the property on which the nuisance is reported, the Department declares the existence of a public nuisance, but the nature thereof is not such as to require the summary abatement of such nuisance, then regular abatement procedures shall be followed. Photographs and reports of the findings and inspections shall be made and filed with the Department.

b. The Department shall determine the person who, from the records in the Recorder’s office, appears to be the titled owner of the property and immediately cause a written notice to be served on such person by personal service or by leaving a copy of the notice at the usual place of residence or business of such owner, or address of such owner shown in the Recorder’s records, or by copy mailed to such owner at such place or address by United States certified mail return receipt. If service of such written notice is unable to be accomplished by any of the methods described above, the Department shall cause a copy of the notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, once a week for two consecutive weeks, and shall further cause a copy of the notice to be left with the person, if any, in possession of such property on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists, or if there is no person in possession thereof, the Department shall cause a copy of the notice to be to be posted at such structure, location or premises. The Department shall also determine from the Recorder’s office who the lienholder of the property, if any, as documented therein, is and cause a written notice to be served on such lienholder by United States mail return receipt.

c. The aforesaid notice to the owner, and lienholder, if any, of the property shall state clearly and concisely the findings of the Department with respect to the existence of a public nuisance. The notice shall further state that unless the owner thereof shall cause the abatement of the public nuisance, pursuant to the orders contained in the Department’s notice, the public nuisance shall be abated by the City at the expense of the owner.

d. Any person who is the recorded owner of the premises, location or structure at the time an order pursuant to this chapter is issued and served upon him is responsible for complying with that order, and liable for any costs incurred by the City therewith, notwithstanding the conveyance of the person’s interests in the property to another after such order was issued and served.

e. The fact that the property is boarded up or otherwise enclosed is not a defense to the determination that a public nuisance exists. [Ord. 07-37(A) § 2, 2007].


5.16.040 Abatement by owner.

a. Within 30 days after the posting and mailing of a notice to abate a nuisance, the owner, agent of the owner, or person in possession of the affected property shall remove and abate such nuisance or show that no nuisance in fact exists. Such showing shall be made by filing a written statement, under oath or affirmation, describing in detail the facts and circumstances that show that no nuisance exists. The statement shall be filed with the Department.

b. The Department, upon written application by the owner within the 30-day period after the notice has been served, may grant additional time for the owner to effect the abatement of the public nuisance; provided, that such extension is limited to a specific time period. [Ord. 07-37(A) § 2, 2007].


5.16.050 Appeal procedures – Hearing.

a. The owner or occupant of the property who has been served with a notice pursuant to this chapter that a public nuisance exists and that it must be abated within 30 days may within seven calendar days after receipt of such notice make a written demand to the Department for a hearing on the question of whether a public nuisance in fact exists. The hearing shall be held within 14 calendar days following receipt by the Department of the written demand and at least two days’ notice of the hearing shall be given to the person who made the written demand for the hearing. The date of the hearing may be postponed for good cause.

b. The hearing shall be conducted by the Appeals Board. Such Appeals Board may amend or modify the notice or order, or extend the time for compliance with the Department’s order by the owner by such date as the majority of the Appeals Board may determine.

c. The owner, agent of the owner, occupant and lienholder, if any, of the subject property shall be given the opportunity to present evidence to the Appeals Board in the course of the hearing.

d. In those instances where the nuisance has been abated by the City, the Appeals Board shall have discretion to waive the cost of abating a nuisance, in whole or in part, if, in the course of the hearing reviewing the decision, the Appeals Board finds that any of the following did not conform to the provisions of this chapter:

1. The notice to remove the nuisance;

2. The work performed in abating the nuisance; or

3. The computation of charges. [Ord. 07-37(A) § 2, 2007].


5.16.060 Abatement by City.

a. If any public nuisance is not abated at the expiration of time stated in the notice or order, or within such additional time as the Department or Appeals Board may grant, the Department shall have the authority to enter upon the property and abate the public nuisance found thereon. In abating such nuisance, the Department may go to whatever extent may be necessary to complete the abatement of the public nuisance and if it is practicable to salvage any material derived in the abatement, the Department may sell the salvaged material at private or public sale at the best price obtainable and shall keep an accounting of the proceeds thereof.

b. The proceeds, if any, obtained from the sale of any material salvaged as a result of an abatement of a public nuisance by the Department shall be deposited to the general fund of the City and any deficit between the amount so received and the cost of the abatement, plus overhead charges, penalties, and interest, is a special assessment and lien against the property in question. Such deficit shall be collected as any other assessment by the City; however, any other alternative collection method may be utilized by the City to recoup the deficit. Should the proceeds of the sale of such salvaged material exceed the cost of abatement, the surplus, if any, shall be paid to the owner of the property from which the public nuisance was abated when a proper claim to the excess is established.

c. In abating a public nuisance, the Department may call upon any of the City departments or divisions for whatever assistance shall be deemed necessary or may by private contract cause the abatement of the public nuisance.

d. The Department shall, after completing the removal and abatement, file a statement of costs with the Finance Director. [Ord. 07-37(A) § 2, 2007].


5.16.070 Notice of assessment – Appeal of charges.

a. Upon receipt of the statement of costs from the Department, the Finance Director shall mail to the owner of the property upon which the public nuisance has been abated notice of the amounts set forth in the statement plus an additional amount for overhead charges and penalty, as provided in this chapter, and stating that the City proposes to assess against the property the amount set forth in the notice and that objections to the proposed assessment must be made in writing and received by the Finance Director within 20 days from the date of mailing such notice. Upon the expiration of the 20-day period, if no objections have been received by the Finance Director, the Finance Director shall cause a notice of the lien to be recorded against the property.

b. If objections of either the property owner or their representative are received by the Finance Director prior to the expiration of the 20-day period, the Finance Director shall refer the matter to the Department for administrative review.

c. Upon conclusion of its administrative review, the Department shall make a written determination that the amount of the charges shall be canceled, reduced, or remain the same. A copy of this determination shall be furnished to the person making the objections together with a notice of such person’s right to appeal to the Appeals Board.

d. If no appeal of a determination by the Department is filed within the time period allowed, a copy of the determination will be furnished to the Finance Director who shall then cause a notice of the lien to be recorded as provided in subsection (a) of this section.

e. If a timely appeal is received by the Appeals Board, a hearing shall be scheduled and held on the matter. If, after the hearing, the Appeals Board determines that the proposed assessment does not comply with subsection (g) of this section, the Appeals Board shall so certify to the Finance Director and the proposed assessment shall be canceled. If, after the hearing, it is determined that the proposed assessment or any part of it is proper and authorized, the Appeals Board shall so certify to the Finance Director who shall record a notice of the lien in the amount as determined appropriate by the Appeals Board, as provided in subsection (a) of this section.

f. The determination of the Appeals Board is a final administrative decision. It is appealable to Superior Court and is not appealable to the City Council.

g.    1. The Department, in administrative review, or the Appeals Board, on appeal, may reduce or cancel a proposed assessment if it is determined that:

a. Any of the following did not conform to the provisions of this chapter:

i. The notice to remove the nuisance; or

ii. The work performed in abating the nuisance; or

iii. The computation of charges; or

b. The owner of the property was eligible for a waiver of costs under HCC 5.16.090.

2. The Department, in administrative review, or the Appeals Board, on appeal, may reduce a proposed assessment by eliminating the civil penalty portion if it is determined that:

a. The current owner was not in possession of the property at the time the notice required in HCC 5.16.030 was posted; or

b. The owner did not receive the notice to remove the nuisance, did not have knowledge of the nuisance and could not, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, have had such knowledge.

h. If, after a notice of lien has been recorded, there is a written request of an owner who alleges that the owner did not receive notice of the proposed assessment, the Finance Director shall refer the matter for review pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

i. The lien may be canceled or reduced by the Department, in administrative review, or the Appeals Board, on appeal, if it is determined that the owner did not receive notice of the proposed assessment, did not previously have knowledge of the lien or of the nuisance abatement work constituting the basis of the lien, could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, have had such knowledge, and in addition, that the circumstances are such that a reduction or cancellation of the charges would have been appropriate had the matter been reviewed pursuant to this section prior to assessment. Upon receipt of a certification from the Appeals Board, pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the Finance Director shall cancel or reduce the lien if required by the determination of the Department or the Appeals Board. [Ord. 07-37(A) § 2, 2007].

An impounded vehicle may be immediately towed and removed to a safe place upon the order of a police officer or peace officer.

c. Upon impoundment, a notice of procedure options shall be placed on the vehicle, and within six hours a copy shall be personally delivered or placed in the U.S. mail addressed to the owner of the vehicle. The notice shall state substantially as follows:

ATTENTION: Your vehicle has been impounded by the City of Homer. As the owner of an impounded vehicle, you have the following options:

(A) You may recover possession of the vehicle by paying to the person having custody of the vehicle the towing and storage fees that may have accrued.

(B) If you take issue with the impoundment of your vehicle, you may:

(i) Recover possession of the vehicle by paying the towing and storage fees that have accrued to such person and claim a refund by filing a demand (on a form provided by the city) for an administrative hearing before a hearing officer as to whether there was a sufficient factual and legal basis for impounding your vehicle; or

(ii) Demand (on a form provided by the city) an administrative hearing before a hearing officer as to whether there was a sufficient factual and legal basis for impounding your vehicle.

To be entitled to such a hearing, your written demand must be filed with the City Clerk (a) within 5 workdays after you learned that your vehicle was impounded or was missing; or (b) within 15 workdays after the city mailed notice to the vehicle’s registered owner that the vehicle had been impounded; whichever occurs first. If you fail to make a timely request for a hearing you will lose all right to challenge the sufficiency of the basis for impoundment.

If timely requested, the hearing must be held within 48 hours after the filing of your written demand, not including Saturdays, Sundays, and city holidays. A determination that there was an insufficient factual or legal basis for impounding your vehicle will require the release of the vehicle to you without your having to pay the towing and storage fees, or will entitle you to a refund if you have already paid the fees.

A hearing may be demanded by filing the appropriate form with the City Clerk at 491 E. Pioneer Avenue, Homer between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on any day other than Saturday, Sunday and city holidays.

To be entitled to such a hearing a written demand must be filed with the City Clerk (1) within five workdays after the owner or person entitled to possession learned that the vehicle was impounded or was missing; or (2) within 15 workdays after the City delivered or mailed the notice required by HCC 7.10.060(c) to the vehicle’s registered owner; whichever occurs first. If no timely request for a hearing is made, the factual and legal basis for impoundment will be conclusively deemed sufficient for all purposes.

b. The hearing will be held within 48 hours after the filing of a timely written demand, not including Saturdays, Sundays, and City holidays.

c. The hearing officer shall not be bound by formal rules of evidence. A copy of the fully completed and signed order of impoundment will constitute prima facie proof of sufficient factual and legal basis for impoundment. The burden will be on the vehicle owner to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there was an insufficient factual or legal basis for impounding the vehicle.

d. A determination by the hearing officer that there was an insufficient factual or legal basis for impounding the vehicle will require the release of the vehicle to the owner or other person entitled to possession without payment of the towing and storage fees, or will entitle the person to a refund if the fees have already been paid.

e. The City will be responsible for payment or refund of the towing and storage fees for any vehicle impounded under this chapter if the hearing officer determines that there was an insufficient factual or legal basis for such impoundment. [Ord. 15-42 § 4, 2015].

7.10.090 Removal of impoundment notice or impounded vehicle prohibited.

a. Unless authorized by a police officer or peace officer with authority to enforce parking laws and regulations, it is unlawful for any person to remove an impoundment order from a vehicle upon which it has been posted.

c. No deed is invalid for irregularities, omissions or defects unless the former owner has been misled so as to be injured.

[Ord. 90-28 § 8, 1990. Code 1967 § 13A-400.262].

b. The hearing officer shall schedule an appeal hearing for the next available hearing date after the date of delivery of the administrative hearing request form to the City Clerk’s office.

c. The appeal hearing shall be conducted informally and may be governed by such rules and procedures as the hearing officer may establish, except that:

1. Each party has the right to be represented by counsel.

2. Each party may present witnesses and evidence.

3. Each party and witnesses may appear in person or by telephone.

Such findings must be reasonably specific so as to provide interested persons and, where appropriate, reviewing authorities, a clear and precise understanding of the reasons for the decision entered. The decision, findings of fact, and conclusions of law shall be forwarded to all parties to the appeal. A final appealable decision must indicate that it is a final order and that a party disputing the decision has 30 days to appeal.

For the purposes of this section the date of issuance is the date upon which the decision was mailed or delivered to the parties. [Ord. 16-42 § 1, 2016].


10.04.120 Impounded vessel procedure.

a. At least 10 days prior to impounding any vessel, the City shall cause to be posted on the vessel, in the Harbormaster’s office, the City Clerk’s office and on the bulletin board at the entrance of the United States Post Office notice of such action to be taken by the City. A copy of the notice shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or operator of the vessel at his last known address, which address shall be the same as that furnished in accordance with the regulations of this tariff. The notice shall contain the name and/or number of the vessel, the name and address, if known, of the owner or operator and the location of the vessel.

b. As to any vessel proposed for impoundment, an owner or operator of the vessel has the right to a pre-impoundment administrative hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to impound the vessel if such person files a written demand, on forms so provided for such a hearing, with the City within 10 days after such person has learned such vessel will be impounded or within 10 days after the return of mail receipt of the notice required by subsection (a) of this section, whichever occurs first.

c. A hearing shall be conducted before a hearing officer designated by the City Manager within 48 hours of receipt of written demand therefor from the person seeking the hearing unless the person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and City holidays are to be excluded from the calculation of the 48-hour period. The hearing officer shall be someone other than the persons who will direct the impounding and storage of the vessel. The sole issue before the hearing officer shall be whether there is probable cause to impound the vessel in question. “Probable cause to impound” shall mean such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there was a breach of Federal, local or municipal law or regulations, or any agreement entered into pursuant thereto, rendering the vessel subject to impoundment. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right to possession of the vessel. The Harbormaster shall carry the burden of establishing that there is probable cause to impound the vessel in question. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. A copy of such decision and reasons therefor shall be provided to the person demanding the hearing and the owner of the vessel if such owner is not the person requesting the hearing. The hearing officer’s decision in no way affects any criminal proceeding connection with the impound in question and any criminal charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the appropriate court. The decision of the hearing officer is final and may only be appealed to the Superior Court. Failure of the owner or operator to request or attend a scheduled pre-impoundment hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right of such hearing.

d. The hearing officer shall only determine that as to the vessel in question either that there is probable cause to impound the vessel or that there is no such probable cause. In the event that the hearing officer determines that there is no probable cause, the hearing officer shall prepare and date a certificate of no probable cause, copies of which shall be given to the owner or operator and to the Harbormaster. Upon receipt of such certificate of probable cause, the Harbormaster may proceed with impoundment and disposition of the vessel by removal, sale or destruction as authorized by this title.

e. Any vessel impounded shall be held by the City for a period of not less than 30 days during which the City shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the City a notice describing the vessel in general terms, the name and/or number, if any, the name and address of the owner, or operator, if known, or if not known shall so state the location of the vessel and the intention of the City to sell the same at public auction, on a day and at a place and time certain, not less than 10 days prior to the sale, for cash to the highest and best bidder. At any time prior to the auction, the owner or operator may redeem the vessel by cash payment of all City charges against the vessel.

f. The minimum acceptable bid shall be a sum equal to the City’s charges against the vessel. The proceeds of the sale shall be first applied to the cost of sale, then to accrued stall license fees and charges, service fees, storage charges, attorney fees and costs, and other expenses provided for in this title, and the balance, if any, shall be held in trust by the City for the owner of the vessel to claim; and if not claimed within one year, the balance shall be deposited into the small boat harbor facilities fund. Upon the sale being made, the City shall make and deliver its bill of sale, without warranty, conveying the vessel to the buyer.

g. If at the public sale there are no bidders for the vessel, the City may destroy, sell at private sale or otherwise dispose of the vessel. The disposition is to be made without liability of the City, its employees or agents to the owner, master or any lien holder of the vessel. [Ord. 95-18(S), 1995; Ord. 88-2, 1988].


10.04.130 Nuisances declared – Removal.

a. For the purposes of this title and in the interest of the greatest use of the facilities of the Homer harbor and the municipal waters by the general public, vessels in the Homer harbor and elsewhere on the municipal waters that are illegally moored, cause an obstruction to navigation, or that are abandoned or derelicts or unfit or unseaworthy or which are maintained in such manner as to make them liable to sinking for lack of being pumped or other maintenance, or which are unsafe or which are maintained in a manner as to constitute a fire hazard, and sunken vessels and vessels in imminent danger of sinking, are declared to be nuisances and subject to abatement and removal from the Homer harbor or other municipal waters by the City or its agents, without liability of the City for any damage done by virtue of the removal or for any of its consequences.

b. Refuse of all kinds or any other obstructions or debris are declared to be public nuisances, and it shall be unlawful for any person to place, or cause to be placed, any public nuisance in the Homer harbor or in the municipal waters, or on the shores thereof. Nets, gear, and other material left on any float or dock for more than 12 hours are hereby declared a public nuisance. Any person causing or permitting the nuisances to be placed as aforesaid shall remove the same and upon his failure to do so, the same may be removed or caused to be removed by the Harbormaster. When the Harbormaster has authorized such nuisances to be removed or stored commercially, all costs of such commercial removal or storage shall be paid by and recoverable from the person creating the nuisances and shall not excuse the person responsible therefor from prosecution hereunder. Any nuisance under this subsection may be impounded, disposed of by destruction, private or public sale, or by any other means deemed reasonable by the Harbormaster. Such disposition is to be made without liability of the City, its employees or agents to the owner, master or any lien holder of the nuisance.

c. Upon the Harbormaster’s written determination that a nuisance described in subsection (a) of this section exists that constitutes a clear and present danger to the public health, safety or general welfare, the nuisance may be summarily abated by the Harbormaster according to HCC 10.04.132 without prior notice.

d. Vessels declared a nuisance under subsection (a) of this section that do not constitute a clear and present danger to the public health, safety and general welfare may be moved, impounded, or disposed of according to the procedure provided in HCC 10.04.120. [Ord. 95-28 § 1, 1995; Ord. 95-18(S), 1995; Ord. 88-2, 1988].


10.04.132 Nuisances – Abatement procedure.

a. Unless otherwise provided, the procedure set forth in this section shall apply whenever a vessel has been impounded or removed or a nuisance vessel abated pursuant to HCC 10.04.130(a) or otherwise, and the pre-impoundment administrative hearing procedures of HCC 10.04.120 were not followed.

b. An impoundment is effective when a written order of impoundment is placed on a vessel. An order of impoundment shall identify the vessel, state the reasons for impoundment, and be dated and signed by the Harbormaster or his authorized designee. An impounded vessel may be immediately towed or otherwise removed upon the order of the Harbormaster. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the City from using alternatives to impoundment, including without limitation removal or other means to abate a nuisance.

c. When action is taken to impound, remove, or otherwise abate a nuisance vessel, notice of such action shall be placed on the vessel if possible, and within six hours a copy of the notice shall be personally delivered or placed in the U.S. mail addressed to the owner of the vessel. The notice shall include the following substantive provisions:

ATTENTION: The vessel _____________ has been impounded/removed/abated by the City of Homer harbormaster as a public nuisance for the following reasons: __________________________________________________________________

As the owner of the vessel you have the following options (those that apply are checked):

____ The vessel has been impounded and you may recover possession of the vessel by paying to the person having custody of the vessel the towing, storage, and other charges that may have accrued. The vessel is at the following location: __________________________________________________________________

____ The vessel has been removed and you may recover possession of the vessel at the following location: __________________________________________________________________

____ The vessel has been destroyed. You may direct any inquiries to the City of Homer harbormaster.

____ The following action has been taken, and any option you may have is described below: _________________________________

If you believe the vessel was improperly impounded, removed, or otherwise abated, you may:

(i) In the case of an impoundment, recover possession of the vessel by paying any towing, storage, or other charges that have accrued, and you may claim a refund or reimbursement by filing a demand (on a form provided by the city) for an administrative hearing before a hearing officer as to whether the harbormaster had a sufficient factual and legal basis to impound the vessel; or

(ii) In the case of an impoundment, you may demand return of the vessel without paying the towing, storage, or other charges by filing a demand (on a form provided by the city) for an administrative hearing before a hearing officer as to whether the harbormaster had a sufficient factual and legal basis to impound the vessel; or

(iii) You may in any other case file a demand (on a form provided by the city) for an administrative hearing before a hearing officer as to whether the harbormaster had a sufficient factual and legal basis to impound, remove, or abate the vessel.

To be entitled to such a hearing, your written demand must be filed with the City Clerk (a) within 5 workdays after you learned that your vessel was impounded, removed, or otherwise abated or (b) within 15 workdays after the City mailed notice to the vessel owner of the action taken, whichever is earlier. If you fail to make a timely request for a hearing you will lose all right to challenge the sufficiency of the basis for the action taken.

If timely requested, the hearing must be held within 48 hours after the filing of your written demand, not including, Saturdays, Sundays, and city holidays, unless you waive your right to a speedy hearing. A determination that there was an insufficient factual or legal basis for the action taken will require the release of the vessel to the owner without payment of the towing, storage, or other accrued charges, or it will entitle the owner to a refund or reimbursement if the charges were already paid.

A hearing may be demanded by filing the appropriate form with the City Clerk at Homer City Hall between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on any day other than Saturday, Sunday and city holidays.

[Ord. 95-28 § 2, 1995].


10.04.134 Nuisances – Post-removal hearing.

a. If demand is timely made, the owner or person entitled to possession of the vessel is entitled to an administrative hearing to determine whether there was a sufficient factual and legal basis for the action to impound, remove, or otherwise abate the vessel. To be entitled to such a hearing, a written demand must be filed with the City Clerk (1) within five workdays after the owner or other person entitled to possession learned that the vessel was impounded, removed, or otherwise abated, or (2) within 15 workdays after the City mailed the notice required by HCC 10.04.132(c) to the vessel owner, whichever is earlier. If no timely request for a hearing is made, the factual and legal basis for the action taken will be conclusively deemed sufficient for all purposes.

b. The hearing will be held within 48 hours after the filing of a written demand, not including Saturdays, Sundays and City holidays, unless the person demanding the hearing waives a speedy hearing.

c. The hearing officer shall not be bound by formal rules of evidence. A copy of the Harbormaster’s written determination that a public nuisance exists will constitute prima facie proof of a sufficient factual and legal basis for the action. The burden will be on the vessel owner to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there was not sufficient factual or legal basis for impounding, removing, or otherwise abating the vessel.

d. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision, including the reasons for the decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person demanding the hearing and the owner of the vessel. The hearing officer’s decision in no way affects any criminal charges that may be pending. The decision of the hearing officer is final and may only be appealed to the Superior Court.

e. A determination by the hearing officer that there was not a sufficient factual or legal basis for the action taken will require the release of the vessel to the owner or other person entitled to possession without payment of the towing, storage, or the accrued charges, or will entitle the person to a refund or reimbursement by the City if the charges have already been paid. If the hearing officer determines there was a sufficient factual and legal basis for the action taken, the Harbormaster may proceed to dispose of the vessel by sale according to HCC 10.04.120(e) through (g), or the Harbormaster may destroy or otherwise dispose of the vessel without sale if he makes a good faith determination that the value of the vessel does not exceed the costs of towing, storage, sale, and other harbor charges accrued against the vessel.

b. Minimize public liability for publicly and privately developed improvements by ensuring that roads and streets will be built to City standards. [Ord. 87-6(S) § 1, 1987].


11.04.020 Applicability.

The requirements of this chapter shall govern the construction or reconstruction of roads and streets within the City of Homer. [Ord. 87-6(S) § 1, 1987].


11.04.030 Definitions.

In this chapter, unless otherwise provided, or the context otherwise requires, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings set forth below:

“Arterial” means a street or highway which provides as a major function the transmission of vehicular through traffic along its prolongation or length (in preference to traffic entering the street or highway from an abutting lot or intersecting road), and which performs a major role in serving the transportation needs of the community (by serving relatively longer trip lengths with minimal interference and higher speeds), and which is identified as an arterial on the Homer Master Roads and Streets Plan.

“As-built drawings” means the plan and profile drawings of the improvements as constructed, drawn to the same level of detail as the original design drawings.

“Base course” means a layer of crushed aggregate placed atop the subbase, according to a specified gradation.

“City” means the City of Homer, a municipal corporation, acting through the City Manager and/or his designees.

“Collector” means a street which collects traffic from local streets and/or relatively large traffic generators, and channels it into the arterial system, and is identified as a “commercial/industrial collector” or is a “residential collector” in the Homer Master Roads and Streets Plan. (A “commercial/industrial collector” is a collector located in a commercial or industrial zoning district, while a “residential collector” is a collector located in a residential district.)

“Cross culvert” means a culvert which crosses beneath the traveled way of street, such that its ends are exposed on the embankment of each side of the street.

“Cul-de-sac” means a street that is closed at one end and which is therefore required to provide a circular turnaround.

“Design Criteria Manual” means a publication issued by the City of Homer entitled “Design Criteria Manual for Streets and Storm Drainage,” dated April 1985.

“Design engineer” is a professional civil engineer, registered in the State of Alaska, who shall perform the project design for the developer.

“Developer” means a person, firm, association, partnership, corporation, governmental unit, or combination of any of these which proposes to install street improvements, either as part of a subdivision development or as a development project on an existing right-of-way.

“Drainage Management Plan” refers to the City of Homer’s documents entitled “Drainage Management Plan – Homer, Alaska” (dated August 1979) and “Revised Drainage Management Plan – Homer, Alaska” (dated February 1982).

“Driveway” means an entrance/exit roadway which provides lateral access to a private property from a public right-of-way, and which is located on private property except for its junction with the public road within such right-of-way.

“Driveway intersection” means the junction of a driveway with a street or other public road.

“Local street” is a street which services primarily relatively short trip lengths and low traffic, allowing transmission of traffic from abutting lots to the collector or arterial system, and which does not qualify for designation as a collector or arterial. For the purposes of this chapter, local streets are segregated into two subclasses: “local residential” streets are those local streets situated in residential zoning districts and “local commercial/industrial” streets are those local streets located in commercial or industrial zoning districts.

“Master Roads and Streets Plan” refers to the document labeled as such, adopted by the City of Homer.

“Nonfrost susceptible material” means nonorganic soil containing less than three percent by weight of grains smaller than 0.02 millimeter obtained from minus three-inch material.

“Non-Motorized Transportation and Trail Plan” means the Homer Non-Motorized Transportation and Trail Plan (2004), adopted as an element of the Homer Comprehensive Plan by HCC 21.02.010(b).

“Non-motorized transportation corridor” means an easement or right-of-way designated for public use for pedestrian, bicycle, equestrian or other non-motorized means of transportation.

“Public access corridor” means an easement or right-of-way providing public access through a lot, subdivision or development.

“Right-of-way” means land, property, or interest therein, usually in a strip, acquired for or dedicated to the public for transportation purposes.

“Road” is synonymous with “street.”

“Roadway” means the portion of a street, road, or highway, including shoulders, for vehicular use.

“Shoulder” means the portion of the roadway contiguous with the traveled way for accommodation of stopped vehicles for emergency use, and/or for lateral support of base and surface courses.

“Street” is a general term denoting a public way or track, or any length thereof, in urban settings, used for purposes of vehicular travel.

“Street intersection” means the junction of two or more public roads, i.e., roads located within public rights-of-way.

“Subbase” means the specified or selected material of planned thickness placed atop the subgrade and below the base course.

“Subdivider” means a person, firm, association, partnership, corporation, governmental unit, or combination of any of these which may hold any recorded or equitable ownership interest in land being subdivided. The term shall also include all heirs, assigns or successors in interest, or representatives of the subdivider, owner, proprietor or developer.

“Subdivision” means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, lease, or building development, including resubdivision. Any addition, deletion or relocation of the boundary of a tract or parcel of land shown on a recorded plat is a subdivision. When appropriate to the context, the term shall refer to the process of subdividing or to the land or areas subdivided.

“Subgrade” means the basement soil material in excavation (cuts), embankment (fills), and embankment foundations immediately below the first layer of subbase and to such depth as may affect the structural design of the roadway.

a. All streets or non-motorized transportation facilities constructed or reconstructed within the City of Homer after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall adhere to the dedication, design and construction standards set forth in this chapter and shall also be designed and constructed according to the procedures and standards set forth in Chapter 11.20 HCC, unless waived as provided in Chapter 11.20 HCC.

b. The City shall require new subdivisions to dedicate the rights-of-way according to the widths specified in HCC 11.04.060(f), according to the appropriate functional classification. Arterials and collectors are as designated in the Master Roads and Streets Plan. This provision may be waived on a case-by-case basis by the Director of Public Works by requiring a minimum dedicated right-of-way of 60 feet along with an expanded building setback of sufficient width to equal the rights-of-way widths specified in HCC 11.04.060(f).

c. The Planning Commission shall require the dedication of a half street if the other half of the street has been dedicated or can reasonably be expected to be dedicated, unless it determines the street would be unnecessary or undesirable. It shall further require half-street dedications if the street is on the Master Roads and Streets Plan map as a planned improvement of the logical existing street.

d. When a subdivision borders or contains a street designated an arterial on the Master Plan map, the Homer Advisory Planning Commission may require shared access or the dedication of a frontage street. Alternatively, an interior road may be required (along the rear lot lines of the lots abutting the arterial) which will serve the access requirements of all the lots fronting the arterial. [Ord. 10-57 § 4, 2011; Ord. 87-6(S) § 1, 1987].


11.04.050 Master Roads and Streets Plan – Adopted.

a. The City hereby adopts the functional classification system, Master Plan map, and preliminary plans and profiles of future streets contained in the Master Roads and Streets Plan.

b. In all new subdivisions, excepting those specifically exempted in Chapter 22.10 HCC, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate street rights-of-way designated as arterials or collectors on the Master Roads and Streets Plan map, in general agreement with the location and geometrics outlined on the map and, if preliminary engineering plans have been prepared, in general accordance with the route layout specified therein. The Planning Commission may require adjustments to the proposed plat at the preliminary platting stage if it finds that such geometrics and alignments are not adhered to.

c. If a development includes a segment of an arterial or collector street as shown on the Master Plan, the developer shall construct the streets on the alignment adopted in the Master Roads and Streets Plan, and according to the geometric requirements (maximum grade, curvature, and intersection grade, and minimum intersection curb return radius) conforming to the respective classification. The developer, in such case, shall be required to construct the street to a 28-foot width in accordance with the minimum requirements of a local residential street; provided, however, that the City may, upon direction of the City Council, elect to require construction to the full standards and pay to the developer the cost difference between the required street and the proposed street.

d. The City Council shall be empowered to designate additional routes as arterials and collectors beyond those adopted on the Master Plan map. [Ord. 87-6(S) § 1, 1987].


11.04.055 Official Road Maintenance Map – Adopted.

a. The “Official Road Maintenance Map of the City of Homer” is enacted by reference and declared to be part of this chapter in its exact form as it exists on the date that the ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted by the City Council. This map shall be kept in the City offices for public inspection.

b. After the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the City shall not accept maintenance responsibility for any roads, existing or future, which are not constructed or reconstructed to the standards of this chapter, unless such road is shown on the “Official Road Maintenance Map of the City of Homer.”

c. City maintenance service, as specified on the official map, shall be provided in two categories:

1. Urban Road Maintenance. Level of service for road maintenance on streets that meet the City standard and these roads are first priority; and

2. Rural Road Maintenance. The level of service for roads that do not meet City standards and are determined to deserve a reduced level of service and these roads take second priority.

d. If the map becomes lost or damaged, the map or significant parts thereof remaining after partial destruction shall be preserved. The City Council may by ordinance enact a new map which shall be consistent with and supersede the old map.

e. The map shall be signed by the City Clerk with a note of the date of enactment by the City Council. Amendments by ordinance shall be immediately added to the “Official Road Maintenance Map of the City of Homer” with a notation of the date of enactment of said ordinance by the City Council. [Ord. 02-33 § 2, 2002; Ord. 02-23(S), 2002; Ord. 87-6(S) § 1, 1987].


11.04.058 Design Criteria Manual – Adopted.

The City of Homer adopts by reference the “Design Criteria Manual for Streets and Storm Drainage,” dated April 1985 and revised February 1987. The “Design Criteria Manual” shall augment the standards of this chapter and shall govern site reconnaissance, survey and soils and design for streets and storm drains. [Ord. 87-6(S) § 1, 1987].


11.04.060 Geometric design requirements.

The following design criteria shall be adhered to on all street construction within the City:

a. Street Alignment. The street construction shall coincide with the right-of-way centerline unless otherwise approved by the City.

b. Street Design. Streets shall be designed to meet the following objectives:

1. To drain adjacent property where possible;

2. To match existing driveways where possible, and in all cases to match existing cross-street grades;

3. To minimize cross-street or driveway grades;

4. To provide drainage of roadways;

5. To facilitate continuity of natural drainage patterns if storm drains are not incorporated in accordance with the Drainage Management Plan.

c. Grade and Curvature Maxima. The following design limitations shall apply to grades and curvature according to the street’s functional classification:

	Classification	Maximum Grade

d. Traffic Forecast. Street design criteria (e.g., pavement thickness, roadway widths, etc.) shall be based on 20-year traffic forecasts as approved by the City. Forecasts for local streets shall be based on estimated trip generation, such estimates to be obtained on per-unit basis from the Design Criteria Manual and standard texts and calculated by the design engineer for the given land-use intensity and type.

e. Cul-de-Sacs. Cul-de-sacs must not be longer than 600 feet and must have turnaround, with a minimum radius to outer edge of pavement or shoulder of 38 feet.

f. Width. Right-of-way, traveled way, and shoulder width standards for City streets shall, at minimum, be as follows:

	Functional Class or Type	Right-of-Way Width

(feet)	Traveled Way Width

*    Shoulder width reductions may be allowed on roads with curb and gutter.

g. The right-of-way width standards of subsection (f) of this section shall constitute minimum dedication requirements for subdivisions for respective street classification. Subdividers and developers shall be required to construct roadways to the width specified for local residential streets, regardless of the street classification.

h. Construction or reconstruction of existing streets in preexisting platted rights-of-way narrower than those defined in subsection (f) of this section shall require dedication of a sufficient construction and maintenance easement on each side of the road to allow the roadway to be constructed in accordance with Chapter 11.20 HCC and the City of Homer Design Criteria Manual.

i. Other design criteria shall be as specified in the City of Homer “Design Criteria Manual for Streets and Storm Drainage.” Further explanation and elaboration of the requirements in subsections (c) through (f) of this section is also set forth in the Design Criteria Manual. [Ord. 87-6(S) § 1, 1987].


11.04.070 Required cross-section.

a. All cross-section designs shall be performed in conformance with the City of Homer Street Design Manual. Thickness shall be based on analysis of native soil and groundwater conditions, as detailed in the Street Design Manual using limited subgrade frost penetration, reduced subgrade strength, California Bearing Ratio, or other methods as appropriate for the functional classification of each roadway; provided, that in no case shall the combined thickness of subbase and base course be less than 24 inches. Base course thickness shall be four inches on paved roads and six inches on unpaved roads.

b. Prior to the placement of roadway structural fill material, native material shall be excavated to subgrade, and geotextile fabric, of a type approved by the City, shall be placed atop of subgrade prior to placement of structural fill.

c. Base course and subbase gradation shall be as specified in the City of Homer’s Design Criteria Manual, except as otherwise approved or specified by the City Public Works Engineer. [Ord. 87-6(S) § 1, 1987].

11.24.030 Assignment of utility locations in rights-of-way.

a. General. A utility shall place new facilities, relocate existing facilities and replace existing facilities in a location assigned by this section. It is the utility’s responsibility to place its facilities within a right-of-way in accordance with this chapter, the Design Criteria Manual, and with a reasonable degree of prudence to enable maximum opportunity for others to use the right-of-way without conflict, including adequate allowances for the future construction of roads, storm sewers, sanitary sewers and water mains in the right-of-way. Utilities governed by this section shall be installed underground unless an exception has been granted by the Public Works Department in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, or HCC 22.10.055.

1. Telephone, Electric and Cable Television Utilities. Telephone, electric and cable television distribution lines will be placed between the boundary of the right-of-way and to six feet within the boundary of the right-of-way. A location farther within the right-of-way must be approved by the Public Works Department and noted on the permit.

2. Natural Gas Utilities. Natural gas utility distribution mains will be placed between the boundary of the right-of-way and eight feet within the boundary of the right-of-way. A location farther within the right-of-way must be approved by the Public Works Department and noted on the permit.

3. Burial Depths. Underground utility lines shall be installed at minimum depths of 36 inches for parallel runs within the right-of-way, and 60 inches for all roadway crossings. The Public Works Director may require different depths to accommodate unusual topography or street widths, especially in areas where storm drainage ditches are used along the roadway.

4. Incomplete Right-of-Way Dedications. If only a portion of a right-of-way has been dedicated, utility facilities shall not be placed along the side of the right-of-way that is likely to be within the roadway after a dedication of additional adjacent right-of-way. If a utility proposes to place facilities on the side of a partial right-of-way where additional adjacent right-of-way is likely to be dedicated, the utility shall obtain easements from the neighboring property owners so that its facilities will be located outside the future roadway.

b. Exceptions to Assigned Utility Locations.

1. If a utility finds it unreasonable to place its facilities as required by subsection (a) of this section, it may apply to the Public Works Department for an exception, submitting at a minimum the following information:

a. A complete explanation of the reasons why the utility is requesting an exception from its assigned location within the right-of-way; and

b. Plans, drawings or sketches necessary to show the locations of other existing utilities, problem areas such as rock or wetlands, and locations where the utility is proposing to place its new facilities.

2. An application for an exception whose necessity becomes evident during construction shall be deemed approved if not rejected or modified within four normal working hours after receipt by the Public Works Department. The utility is responsible for determining whether the application for an exception has been approved, rejected or modified.

3. This subsection shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner that would permit an underground utility to be installed above ground. [Ord. 12-13 § 1, 2012].


11.24.040 Relocation of utility facilities within the right-of-way.

a. If the City or a third party lawfully elects to change the grade or location of any road, street, public place or highway, and the change will conflict with a utility facility, upon reasonable request and notice from the City the utility shall relocate its facility, making every effort to accommodate the construction schedule.

b. The City will reimburse the utility for facility relocation costs under the following conditions:

1. The City requests the relocation for a City project or activity reflected in the City’s capital budget;

2. The relocation is necessitated by a disturbance to the utility’s facilities incident to the City constructing facilities or otherwise working in the right-of-way; or

3. The City requests the relocation in writing for the benefit of a third party, incident to the third party constructing facilities or working in a right-of-way. This provision does not affect any right that the City may have to recover costs of the relocation from the third party.

c. Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the utility shall pay the cost of relocating its facilities where the relocation is made necessary by:

1. The failure of the utility to install the facilities in a reasonably prudent manner;

2. The utility placed its facilities in the right-of-way after July 1, 1985, without first obtaining a permit from the City to do so, or the as-built location of the facilities varies from the location approved in the permit;

3. Repairs by the City either to restore the right-of-way after an emergency or otherwise to reasonably maintain the serviceability of the right-of-way in the condition existing when the utility first constructed its facilities; or

4. Any other circumstance where the RCA has determined such payment to be reasonable. [Ord. 12-13 § 1, 2012].


11.24.050 Costs of utility relocations to be reimbursed by the City.

a. Where HCC 11.24.040 requires the City to pay costs of relocating utility facilities, the City shall reimburse the utility for its reasonable cost of the relocation less a “credit” for the value of salvaged materials and betterments resulting from the construction of new facilities.

b. The City reserves the right to audit books and accounts of a utility to verify its determination of reasonable costs for engineering, acquisition of rights-of-way or easements, labor, material, equipment, overhead, salvaged materials, and betterment incidental to relocation of the facilities for a term of six years after substantial completion of the construction project.

c. Overhead rates for a utility facility relocation project that is reimbursable by the City shall be negotiated prior to commencement of work and shall not exceed overhead rates approved for relocation projects reimbursed by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. Utility equipment stationed at a project in a “standby capacity” will not be expensed to relocation projects.

d. The City reserves the right to “offset” against a utility’s claim for reimbursement of relocation costs for damages and delay claims it may incur for failure of the utility to perform a relocation in a timely or acceptable manner. [Ord. 12-13 § 1, 2012].


11.24.060 Utility construction project permits.

a. After securing a right-of-way use permit under HCC 11.24.020, a utility shall obtain a permit from the Public Works Department before performing each individual road opening project or excavation within a right-of-way.

b. A utility need not obtain a construction project permit under this section for normal maintenance of utility facilities within right-of-way unless the maintenance work will require an excavation in the roadway.

c. An application for a construction project permit shall be made upon a form provided by the City, accompanied by the permit fee in the City fee schedule established by resolution of the Council, and shall include, at a minimum, the following information:

14.08.072 Priority use of water.

The first priority of use of the water produced by the Homer water system is to provide for the human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection needs of water consumers located within the certificated service area.

Such action shall only be taken upon a legislative finding by the City Council that such action is in the best interest of the City. If practicable, the City will give 30 days’ notice to the public, affected bulk water customers, and resellers of action taken under this subsection, but the failure to give such advance notice will not render the restriction, interruption, decrease, or termination ineffective, nor will it give rise to any claim or action against the City.

Examples of circumstances that may justify the declaration of a water shortage include, but are not limited to, increased demand for water resulting from new development or population increases; low water levels in the reservoir or other water supply deficiencies; malfunction of the water system; increased demand from bulk water customers, resellers, or consumers located within or outside the certificated service area; or any other cause or circumstances that render the output of the Homer water system inadequate to meet the demands.

b. The City Manager may, in his or her discretion, declare a water emergency of not to exceed 15 days, and the City Council may, in its discretion, declare a water emergency of not to exceed 30 days without a public hearing, or of any length after a public hearing, upon adoption of a finding that sudden or unanticipated causes have impaired or pose imminent threat of impairment of the City’s ability to meet the ordinary current demands of all consumers or purchasers of City water. Examples of circumstances that may justify the declaration of a water emergency include, but are not limited to, disaster; actual or imminent threat of malfunction or breakdown of dams, water treatment facilities, mains, distribution lines, pumps, storage tanks, or any other component of the water system; actual or imminent threat of contamination of the water supply; or injury or imminent threat of injury to the public health, safety, or welfare.

In addition, the City may take any other measures that the City determines, in its sole discretion, are necessary to alleviate or otherwise address the water shortage or water emergency, including, but not limited to, allocating water necessary for the first priority uses identified in HCC 14.08.072 and establishing secondary priorities and allocations for the remaining water, without discrimination between consumers located within the certificated service area using water for the same purpose or purposes.

b. Any measures adopted in response to a declared water shortage or water emergency shall, for the duration of the period of the declared shortage or emergency, prevail over any conflicting provisions of law establishing rights of persons to receive specific or proportionate amounts of the water supply available for distribution within the certificated service area or otherwise.

c. Any measures adopted in response to a declared water shortage or water emergency shall be made available for public inspection and copying at the City Clerk’s office, at the City Library, and at the Department of Public Works for the duration of the period of the declared shortage or emergency. As soon as practical after the adoption of such measures, notice of the measures shall also be published once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, unless the duration of the declared shortage or emergency ends sooner.

In this chapter:

“Cost” means all expenses incurred by the City for an improvement, including without limitation advertising expenses, fees of engineers, architects and surveyors, legal fees, costs of property acquisition, payments to construction contractors, costs of interim and long-term financing of the improvement, including costs of issuing bonds and notes, and City administrative costs.

17.04.020 Purpose of chapter.

a. A special assessment district may be created for the purpose of acquiring, installing or constructing a capital improvement that primarily benefits real property in the district, in contrast to capital improvements that benefit the entire community and are paid for with general government resources.

b. The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe the procedure for initiating a special assessment district, authorizing an improvement in a special assessment district, approving and levying special assessments, payment of special assessments, and the authorization of special assessment bonds, for public information and administrative guidance. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.030 Assessment authority.

a. The City may assess all or part of the cost of a capital improvement against real property benefited by the improvement, whether the property is privately or governmentally owned, including real property that is exempt from taxation.

b. A capital improvement that is provided through a special assessment district may be owned by the City, a public utility, or another entity that is qualified to own and operate the capital improvement. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.040 Initiation of district.

a. A special assessment district may be initiated by:

1. Resolution approved by a vote of not less than three-fourths of the Council; or

2. Petition signatures of the record owners of real property that would bear not less than 50 percent of the assessed cost of the improvement received by the City Clerk within 60 days after the mailing of the petition to record owners of property in the proposed district. Upon payment of the nonrefundable filing fee in the City fee schedule established by resolution of the Council, the City Clerk shall prepare a petition for distribution by certified mail to all record owners of property in the proposed district that contains:

a. A statement that it is a petition to form a special assessment district, and describing the capital improvement for which the district is proposed;

b. For each property in the proposed district, the Kenai Peninsula Borough tax parcel number and property description, the name and mailing address of the record owner, and a place for the record owner’s signature; and

c. A statement that to support initiation of the proposed district, the record owner must sign and return the petition to the City Clerk within 60 days after the date the petition was mailed.

b. Upon adoption of a resolution initiating a special assessment district, or the City Clerk’s verification that a petition to initiate a district bears sufficient signatures, the City Clerk shall:

1. Schedule a meeting of record owners of real property in the proposed district, notify the record owners by mail of the date, time and location of the meeting, and include a copy of the notice in the City’s regular meeting advertisement; and

2. Refer the proposed district to the City Manager, who shall prepare an improvement plan for the district that includes final boundaries for the district, the design of the proposed improvement, a cost estimate for the improvement, the percentage of the improvement cost to be assessed against properties in the district, a method for allocating the assessed cost of the improvement among the properties in the district, the time period over which assessments will be financed, and a preliminary assessment roll for the district. [Ord. 16-20 § 1, 2016; Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.050 Creation of district.

a. Upon completion of an improvement plan under HCC 17.04.040, the City Clerk shall set a time for a public hearing on the necessity of the improvement and proposed improvement plan. Notice of the hearing shall be published at least twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, and mailed via certified mail to every record owner of real property in the proposed district not less than 60 days before the hearing.

b. A record owner of real property in the proposed district may file a written objection to the improvement plan with the City Clerk no later than the day before the date of the public hearing on the improvement plan. If owners of real property that would bear 50 percent or more of the assessed cost of the improvement file timely written objections, the Council may not proceed with the improvement unless it revises the improvement plan to reduce the assessed cost of the improvement that is borne by objecting record owners to less than 50 percent of the assessed cost of the improvement. If the resolution changes the district boundary in the improvement plan, the City Clerk shall notify all record owners of property included in the district under the improvement plan of the change.

c. At the noticed date and time, the Council shall hold a public hearing on the necessity of the improvement and proposed improvement plan. After the public hearing, the Council shall act upon a resolution determining to proceed with the proposed improvement. The resolution shall find that the improvement is necessary, of benefit to the properties to be assessed, and if the district is initiated by petition, that the petition is in proper form and bears sufficient signatures. The findings of the Council are conclusive. The resolution shall contain a description of the improvement, the estimated cost of the improvement, the percentage of the cost to be assessed against the properties in the district, and a description of the properties to be assessed.

d. If the owners of 100 percent of the real property in the proposed district waive in writing the notice, protest period and public hearing required under this section, the question of creating the district may be submitted to the Council without such notice, protest period or public hearing. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.060 Contract – Approval of increased costs.

a. After a special assessment district has been created, the City shall contract for the construction of the improvement. If the City will own the improvement, it shall solicit bids for construction of the improvement. If the City will not own the improvement, it shall contract with the owner of the improvement to provide for its construction.

b. If the cost of constructing the improvement will exceed 115 percent of the estimated cost of construction of the improvement in the improvement plan, the City shall not contract for the construction of the improvement without first:

1. Notifying all record owners of property in the district via certified mail of the increased cost; and

2. Within 30 days after the mailing of notice of the increased cost to record owners of property in the district, receiving written objections from record owners of property that would bear less than one-half of the cost of the improvement.

c. If record owners of property that would bear one-half or more of the cost of the improvement object in writing to the increased cost, the City will not contract to construct the improvement. The Council either may levy assessments in the district in an amount sufficient to recover costs incurred for preliminary design and engineering services or determine that the City shall assume such costs. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.070 Assessment roll.

a. After completion of the improvement the Council shall assess costs of the improvement by a method that the Council determines will assess each property in the district in proportion to the benefit that it receives from the improvement.

b. The City shall prepare an assessment roll stating for each property in the district the name and address of the record owner, Kenai Peninsula Borough parcel number, a description of the property, the amount assessed against the property, and the assessed value of the property as determined by the Borough Assessor.

c. Each property in the district shall be identified and assessed on the assessment roll in accordance with the legal description of the property at the time the Council certifies the assessment roll; except that where assessments are in an equal amount per parcel (i.e., without regard to parcel area, dimension or other characteristic), a property that was created by combining parcels after the public hearing under HCC 17.04.050(c) shall be assessed that amount multiplied by the number of parcels that comprised the property at the time of the public hearing.

d. The Council shall fix a time to hear objections to the assessment roll. Not less than 15 days before the hearing, the City Clerk shall send notice of the hearing and assessment roll by certified mail to each record owner of an assessed property, and publish notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.080 Certification of assessment roll.

After the hearing the Council shall correct any errors or inequalities in the assessment roll. If an assessment is increased, a new hearing shall be set and notice published, except that a new hearing and notice is not required if all record owners of property subject to the increased assessment consent in writing to the increase. Objection to the increased assessment shall be limited to record owners of properties whose assessments were increased. When the assessment roll is corrected, the Council shall confirm the assessment roll by resolution. The City Clerk shall record the resolution and confirmed assessment roll with the District Recorder. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.090 Payment.

a. In the resolution confirming the assessment roll, the Council shall fix the time or times when assessments or assessment installments are due, the amount of penalty on a delinquent payment and the rate of interest on the unpaid balance of an assessment.

Within five days after mailing the statements, the Finance Director shall publish notice of mailing the statements in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.100 Subdivision after levy of assessments.

a. Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, upon the subdivision of a property assessed as a single parcel, the amount of the assessment shall be allocated among the resulting lots that benefit from the improvement on the same basis that the assessment originally was allocated.

b. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, upon the subdivision of a property assessed as a single parcel in an assessment district where assessments were levied in an equal amount per parcel (i.e., without regard to parcel area, dimension or other characteristic), then no resulting parcel, other than the parcel that contains the original connection to the improvement for which the assessment was levied, may connect to the improvement until a subdivided property connection fee is paid for the parcel.

1. The amount of the connection fee shall be equal to the amount of the original assessment, adjusted up or down by a percentage equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for Anchorage, Alaska, from the end of the calendar year preceding the original assessment date to the end of the calendar year preceding the date the parcel is connected to the improvement.

2. If the original assessment was payable in installments the City may enter into a written agreement for the payment of the connection fee in installments on terms that are substantially the same as those authorized for the payment of the original assessment, secured by a deed of trust on the parcel.

3. Upon receiving connection fee payments, the City shall allocate such payments to each property assessed in the district in proportion to the amount originally assessed against the property, either by adjusting the original assessment amount or disbursing a payment to the record owner at the time of disbursement. 

c. Upon the subdivision of a property assessed as a single parcel in an assessment district for natural gas distribution improvements where assessments were levied in an equal amount per parcel (i.e., without regard to parcel area, dimension or other characteristic), the assessment levied on the property that is to be subdivided shall be paid in full before the recording of the final plat. No parcel that results from the subdivision shall be subject to assessment for the improvements, but shall be charged for connecting to the improvements in accordance with the tariff of the public utility that provides natural gas service to the parcel. [Ord. 15-11 § 1, 2015; Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.110 Assessments to be liens.

Assessments are liens upon the property assessed and are prior and paramount to all liens except those having priority under State law. They shall be enforced in the same manner as property tax liens. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.120 Reassessment.

a. The City Council shall within one year correct any deficiency in a special assessment found by a court, under the procedure for certification of the assessment roll in HCC 17.04.070 and 17.04.080.

b. Payments on the initial assessment are credited to the property upon reassessment. The reassessment becomes a charge upon the property notwithstanding failure to comply with any provision of the assessment procedure. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.130 Objection and appeal.

a. The regularity or validity of an assessment may not be contested by a person who did not file with the City Clerk a written objection to the assessment roll before its confirmation. The decision of the Council on the objection may be appealed to the Superior Court within 30 days after the date of confirmation of the assessment roll.

b. If no objection is filed or appeal taken within the time provided in this section, the assessment procedure shall be considered regular and valid in all respects. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.140 Interim financing.

The notes shall bear interest at a rate or rates authorized by the resolution or ordinance, and shall be redeemed either in cash or bonds for the improvement project.

b. Notes issued against assessments shall be claims against the assessments that are prior and superior to a right, lien or claim of a surety on the bond given to the City to secure the performance of the contract for construction of the improvement, or to secure the payment of persons who have performed work or furnished materials under the contract.

c. The Finance Director may accept notes against special assessments on conditions prescribed by the Council in payment of:

1. Assessments against which the notes were issued in order of priority;

2. Judgments rendered against property owners who have become delinquent in the payment of assessments; and

a. The Council by ordinance may authorize the issuance and sale of special assessment bonds to pay all or part of the cost of an improvement in a special assessment district. The principal and interest of the bonds shall be payable solely from the special assessments levied against property in the district. The assessment shall constitute a sinking fund for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds. The benefited property may be pledged by the Council to secure payment of the bonds.

b. On default in a payment due on a special assessment bond, a bondholder may enforce payment of principal, interest, and costs of collection in a civil action in the same manner and with the same effect as actions for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property. Foreclosure shall be against all property on which assessments are in default. The period for redemption is the same as for a mortgage foreclosure on real property.

c. Before the Council may issue special assessment bonds, it shall establish a guarantee fund and appropriate to the fund annually a sum adequate to cover a deficiency in meeting payments of principal and interest on bonds if the reason for the deficiency is nonpayment of assessments when due. Money received from actions taken against property for nonpayment of assessments shall be credited to the guarantee fund. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].

The notice also shall include an updated copy of the preliminary assessment roll. [Ord. 12-15 § 1, 2012].


17.04.170 Water and sewer connections required.

The owner of property in a water or sewer special assessment district that contains an occupied building shall connect to the improvement constructed in the district within one year after the date that the resolution confirming the assessment roll for the district becomes final.

To obtain the deferment, the owner shall enter into a deferred assessment agreement with the City before the end of the period for filing objections to the district under HCC 17.04.050. The agreement shall provide that the lot has frontage on two streets, to only one of which the lot has access; that the lot owner shall pay the part of the assessment that is based on frontage on the street to which the lot has access; and that the owner shall pay the part of the assessment that is based on the other street frontage when the lot acquires access to the street from that frontage.

2. Owns or has a life tenancy in the assessed property, and permanently resides in a single-family dwelling on the property; and

3. Is not determined by the City, after notice and hearing, to have been conveyed the property primarily for the purpose of obtaining the deferment.

b. An assessment payment deferment is subject to approval by the Council. A person seeking deferment of an assessment payment shall file a written application with the Finance Director supported by documentation showing that the applicant meets the criteria in subsection (a) of this section. A person requesting an assessment payment deferment the first year the assessment is levied must file an application for deferment with the City no more than 15 days after receiving the initial assessment. A person requesting an assessment payment deferment under this section in any year after the first year must file an application for deferment no later than April 15th of the year for which the deferment is sought. A person must file an application each year for which deferment is sought and shall be required to prove eligibility for deferment as of January 1st of each year for which a deferment is requested. Within the same year the City for good cause shown may waive the claimant’s failure to make timely application and approve the application as if timely filed.

c. Assessment payment deferments are subject to the availability of funds appropriated for that purpose. An application for an assessment payment deferment shall be submitted to the Council with a report from the Finance Director as to the availability of funds to appropriate for the deferment. Deferred assessments are funded from the following sources:

1. The appropriate utility operating fund for deferred water and sewer assessment payments.

One of the purposes of the enactment of this chapter is to enable the Chief of Police to observe any dogs and other animals which have bitten any person or animal in order to determine whether the same are infected by rabies. A violation of this section shall be punishable by a fine of not less than $300.00 and not more than $500.00, and the unsuspended portion of the fine shall not be less than $100.00. [Ord. 16-38(S)(A) § 12, 2016; Ord. 88-1, 1988].

c. Permit a vicious animal to be housed or transported in or on any motor vehicle unless the animal is muzzled to prevent the animal from biting any person. (Exception: vicious animals locked in the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle need not be muzzled if the windows are adequately closed to prevent the animal from exiting the vehicle);

d. Permit a vicious animal to leave premises owned or controlled by the animal’s owner or his agent (except as authorized in subsection (c) of this section) unless the animal is securely muzzled.

Any animal in violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall, upon conviction of the owner or the agent, for that offense, be immediately seized by the City and held for destruction. A violation of this section shall be punishable by a fine of not less than $300.00 nor more than $500.00, and the unsuspended portion of the fine shall not be less than $100.00.

b. A notice of administrative hearing shall be served upon the animal’s owner or his designee under the procedures set for service of summons in a civil action. The notice shall specify the date, time, and location of the hearing. The hearing may not be less than three days following the service of the hearing notice on the animal owner or his designee.

c. The hearing shall consider all information pertinent to the specific violation of HCC 20.20.030 which initiated the impoundment and hearing process, and may additionally consider any information concerning prior violations or incidents with this same animal, as well as any information concerning the animal owner’s or his designee’s prior violations of the Homer animal ordinances with any other animal.

d. The hearing shall address and enter its formal findings as to whether:

1. The animal is a vicious animal under HCC 20.04.020;

2. The owner or designee thereof failed to use all reasonable precautions to control his animal and protect the public;

3. The circumstances of this incident under consideration constitute a danger to the public.

e. If a majority of Board members find in the affirmative as to all three of the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, the Hearing Board shall order the animal destroyed. The owner or designee, if present at the hearing, shall be verbally notified of the findings and order at the conclusion of the hearing. Written findings shall also be prepared and served upon the owner or designee. If the owner or designee is not present at the hearing, written findings and destruction order shall be served on that person as soon as possible following the hearing.

f. Absent an affirmative finding by the Hearing Board as to one or more of the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, the animal shall be immediately released to its owner or designee. The Hearing Board shall, in the event of release under this provision, prepare a written notice which shall be delivered or mailed to the animal’s owner, outlining the Hearing Board’s recommendations as to actions that owner should take to prevent future incidents and to protect the public.

g. Any appeal of the Hearing Board’s finding and destruction order shall be taken through the Alaska Court System within 10 days of the receipt of said findings and order by the owner. The filing of an appeal will automatically stay the order of destruction pending resolution of the appeal. The animal shall remain in impound at the owner’s expense pending resolution of the appeal. [Ord. 16-38(S)(A) § 14, 2016; Ord. 88-1, 1988].


20.20.050 Destruction of vicious animal.

Vicious animals to be destroyed upon Administrative Hearing Board order shall be destroyed as follows:

a. The animal shall remain in impound for 10 days following the date the owner (or his designee) is verbally notified of the Hearing Board’s decision, or the date that a written finding and destruction order is served on the owner (or his designee) to allow that person to appeal the destruction order through the courts.

b. If the City is not served with a notice of appeal of the destruction order within the 10-day holding period outlined in subsection (a) of this section, the City shall immediately proceed to humanely destroy the animal. [Ord. 88-1, 1988].


20.20.060 Conditional release of vicious animal.

b. Agrees to the immediate seizure and destruction of the animal if it enters the City limits;

21.05.010 Purpose.

This chapter explains how certain measurements are made in the zoning code. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.05.020 Measuring distances.

a. When measuring distances for setbacks, structure dimensions, and similar measurements, all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate lot line, edge of structure, or other object. These distances are not measured by following the topography of the land.

b. When measuring a required distance, such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the measurement is made at the shortest distance between the two objects, except as otherwise provided in this section or other sections of the zoning code.

c. Measurements involving a building are made to the closest wall of the building. Windowsills, belt courses, cornices, eaves, chimneys, bay windows up to 12 feet in length, and similar incidental architectural features that project not more than two feet into any required yard are not included in the measurement, and if they extend more than two feet into a required yard, that portion beyond two feet is included in the measurement. Paved terraces are not included in the measurement.

d. Covered porches, covered decks and covered entrances are included in a measurement involving a building. Unroofed porches, decks, landings and stairs are excluded from the measurement of front and rear yards only if no portion other than a light handrail extends higher than 16 inches above the finished grade.

e. Open fire escapes are excluded from the measurement of any required yard only if they project not more than four feet, six inches into a required yard.

f. Structures or portions of structures that are entirely underground are not included in measuring required distances. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.05.030 Measuring heights.

a. When measuring height of a building, the following are included in the measurement: screening, parapets, mansards or similar structures.

b. When measuring height of a building, the following are excluded from the measurement:

1. Steeples, spires, belfries, cupolas and domes if not used for human occupancy, chimneys, ventilators, weather vanes, skylights, water tanks, bulkheads, monuments, flagpoles, wind energy systems, television and radio antennas, other similar features, and necessary mechanical appurtenances usually carried above roof level.

2. Wireless communications equipment that does not extend more than 10 feet above the height of the building.

c. When determining building height on a sloping lot, building height shall be calculated as follows: more than 50 percent of the perimeter of the building shall meet the maximum building height requirements; the maximum elevation of the remainder of the building shall not exceed the elevation of the first portion nor add more than 12 feet of building height at any point.

d. When determining the height of a nonbuilding structure, such as a sign, fence, amateur radio tower, communications tower or wireless communications support structure, the height shall be calculated as the distance from the base of the structure at normal grade to the top of the highest part of the structure, excluding lightning rods. For this calculation, normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any fill, berm, mound, or excavation made for the purpose of locating or supporting the structure. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, structure height shall be calculated on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the structure is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the main building on the lot, whichever is lower. [Ord. 14-18(A)(S-2) §§ 2, 3, 2016; Ord. 09-34(A) § 3, 2009; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.05.040 Measuring slopes.

When calculating the slope of a lot, an average slope is used based on the elevations at the corners of the lot. The average slope of a lot, expressed as a percentage, is calculated by subtracting the average elevation of the uphill lot line and the average elevation of the downhill lot line and dividing the difference by the average distance between the two lot lines. The average elevation of the uphill or downhill lot line is calculated by adding the elevations at the ends of the lot line and dividing by two. See Figure 1.

[Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.05.050 Measuring lot width.

a. The width of a lot is calculated as horizontal distance between the side property lines of a lot, measured at right angles to the lot depth at the rear of the required front yard setback. See Figure 2.

21.40.070 Requirements.

The requirements of this section shall apply to all structures and uses in the BCWP district unless more stringent requirements are required pursuant to Chapter 21.71 HCC. The City of Homer water utility is exempt from this section.

a. Impervious Coverage.

1. Lots two and one-half acres and larger shall have a maximum total impervious coverage of 4.2 percent.

2. Lots smaller than two and one-half acres shall have a maximum total impervious coverage of 4.2 percent, except as provided in subsection (a)(3) of this section.

3. Lots smaller than two and one-half acres may be allowed impervious coverage up to 6.4 percent if (a) the owner submits a lot-specific mitigation plan for the City Planner’s approval, and (b) if approved, thereafter implements and continuously complies with the approved plan. The mitigation plan must be designed to mitigate the effect of impervious coverage on water flow and the effect of loss of vegetation created by the impervious coverage and shall comply with the following performance standards:

a. Disturbed areas shall be reseeded by August 31st.

b. Stormwater retention for the proposed new impervious surface must be provided on site.

i. The post-development stormwater discharge rate shall not exceed the pre-development peak discharge rate (PDR) for the 10-year frequency storm event, consisting of rainfall for a period of three consecutive hours at a rate of one-half inch per hour. 

ii. Retention may be provided in the form of one or a combination of dry wells, rain barrels, rain gardens, foot drain retention or other method approved by the City Planner. 

b. Impervious Coverage Calculations.

1. For the purpose of calculating impervious coverage on lots smaller than two and one-half acres, 50 percent of driveways and walkways may be excluded from the calculation, if constructed and maintained in accordance with a mitigation plan that addresses the entire impervious coverage proposed for the lot, submitted and approved in accordance with subsection (a)(3) of this section. Exclusion of more than 50 percent of driveways and walkways from the calculation shall require approval of the Planning Commission. 

2. Except as otherwise provided in this section, parcels of land subdivided after February 25, 2003, shall be allowed a total impervious coverage of 4.2 percent including right-of-way (ROW) dedication. ROW coverage area shall be calculated as 50 percent of the total area of the dedicated ROW. The impervious coverage allowed for the subdivided parcels shall be calculated after deducting the ROW coverage from the total parcel allowance according to the following formula:

	Formula:

	(Area of parcel being subdivided) x 0.042 = Total allowed impervious coverage (TAC)

	(Area of ROW dedication) x 0.5 = ROW coverage (ROW C)

	(TAC) – (ROW C) = Allowed impervious coverage for remainder of parcel being subdivided

	(Area of parcel being subdivided) – (Area of ROW dedication) = New parcel area

	(Allowed impervious coverage for remainder) ÷ (New parcel area) x 100 = Percent impervious coverage allowed on subdivided lots.

c. Additional Requirements for Subdivisions and Lots.

1. Lots created by subdivision after February 25, 2003, shall be a minimum of four and one-half acres.

2. Applications for subdivisions, dedications, and vacations of easements and rights-of-way in the BCWP district must be approved by the Planning Commission prior to submission to the Kenai Peninsula Borough.

d. Building Setbacks. Buildings must be set back from the Bridge Creek Reservoir and from streams as provided in HCC 21.40.110 and 21.40.120.

e. Sewer Systems. Appropriate to the use of the lot, each lot shall be served by a septic or sewer system approved by the Alaska State Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC). Stream setbacks equal to 100 feet for drain fields and subsurface discharge and 250 feet for raised septic systems are required.

f. Ongoing Construction and Timber Harvesting. All activities including, but not limited to, timber harvesting, road building, subdivision and building activities involving loss of vegetation ground cover or soil disturbance and that are in process on February 25, 2003, shall be required to obtain permits under this chapter and shall fully conform to the terms of this chapter. Activities leaving disturbed or lost vegetative ground cover, disturbed soils without revegetation or leaving slash piles will be considered in process for the purposes of this subsection, regardless of when the activity occurred.

g. Pending Subdivisions. Subdivisions that have not received final plat approval by February 25, 2003, shall obtain approval from the Planning Commission and shall be required to conform to the requirements of this chapter. [Ord. 15-23(S) § 1, 2015; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.40.080 Erosion and sediment control.

a. All activities within the BCWP district involving the disturbance of the existing ground cover (i.e., topsoil or vegetation or both) resulting from excavation, grading or filling or other similar activity and involving (1) any area within 500 feet of Bridge Creek Reservoir or 100 feet from any known stream or tributary or (2) an area in excess of 6,000 square feet require a conditional use permit approved by the Planning Commission. The conditional use permit must require that the activity comply with a site-specific erosion and sediment control plan prepared and signed by a certified hydrologist, professional engineer, or soil scientist whose qualifications to prepare such a plan are reviewed and approved by the Public Works Director.

b. The erosion and sediment control plan shall ensure compliance with the following requirements:

1. A drainage system shall be provided to direct all runoff from impervious coverage or the disturbed ground either into an engineered drainage system or into a natural drainage, but no runoff shall be discharged untreated directly into the Bridge Creek Reservoir, or any stream or watercourse tributary to Bridge Creek Reservoir.

2. Where open-ditch construction is used to handle drainage within the tract, a minimum of 30 feet shall be provided between any structures and the top of the bank of the defined channel of the drainage ditch.

3. When a closed system is used to handle drainage within the tract, all structures shall be a minimum of 10 feet from the closed system.

4. Natural vegetation shall remain undisturbed except as necessary to construct improvements and to eliminate hazardous conditions, in which case it must be replanted with approved materials including ground cover, shrubs and trees. Native vegetation is preferred for replanting operations, and will be used where practicable.

5. Grading must not alter the natural contours of the terrain except as necessary for building sites or to correct unsafe conditions. The locations of buildings, roads and rights-of-way must be planned to follow and conform to existing contours as nearly as possible.

6. Upon completion of earthwork, all exposed slopes and all cleared, filled, and disturbed soils shall immediately be given sufficient protection by appropriate means, such as landscaping, planting, and maintenance of vegetative cover, or temporary protective measures to prevent erosion.

7. All exposed, cleared, filled and disturbed soils shall be revegetated within the current growing season, unless required to be revegetated sooner by other provisions of this title or other law.

8. Drainage, erosion, siltation, slope failure and other adverse effects may be prevented or controlled by means other than vegetation, if approved by the Planning Commission.

9. Development activities shall not adversely impact other properties or watershed water quality by causing adverse alteration of surface water drainage, increased turbidity above natural conditions, surface water ponding, slope failure, erosion, siltation, intentional or inadvertent fill, root damage to neighboring trees, or other adverse physical impacts. The erosion and sediment control plan shall address this requirement, and the property owner and developer shall take such steps, including installation of culverts or buffers, or other methods, as necessary to comply with this requirement. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].

21.40.110 Stream buffers.

a. A stream buffer must be preserved and maintained along all perennial and intermittent streams in the BCWP district. The stream buffer must be at least 50 feet on each side of the stream measured from the top of the stream bank. Buildings and other features that require grading or construction must be set back at least 10 additional feet from the edge of the buffer. To avoid a decrease in the buffer’s effectiveness in protecting the stream the buffer shall remain in natural and undisturbed vegetation.

b. The following exceptions or intrusions into the stream buffer may be granted by conditional use permit approved by the Planning Commission:

1. Street, driveway, culvert, recreational features, intakes, utilities, bridges or other crossings; provided, that they are designed to minimize the amount of intrusion into the buffer. The aforementioned structures and improvements may run generally within the stream buffer only where no other access route is available and when their design minimizes the amount of intrusion of the stream buffer.

2. Passive recreational activities, such as walking trails; provided, that service facilities for such activities, including but not limited to parking, picnicking and sanitary facilities, are located outside of the buffer.

3. Clearing and re-vegetating the stream buffer for the purposes of improving its pollutant and silt removal efficiency may be permitted based upon clear and convincing proof that efficiency will be improved.

4. Stormwater control structures and temporary erosion control structures; provided, that:

a. The property owner or applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director and Planning Commission that such facilities cannot be practicably located outside of the stream buffer, and that any proposed stormwater control structure is sited and designed to minimize disturbance of the stream and stream buffer. Siting stormwater control structures away from the stream channel is preferable to siting such structures in the stream channel.

b. A vegetated buffer of a width not less than the minimum recommended by the Public Works Director is provided around the stormwater control structures.

c. Any land disturbed for construction of these structures is immediately revegetated.

5. Timber harvest operations; provided, that:

a. Along perennial streams the buffer must include, but is not limited to, a 50-foot permanent buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation and an additional 75-foot buffer area of selective logging leaving no less than 30 percent of the original standing timber; and

b. Along intermittent streams or drainages the buffer must include, but is not limited to, a 25-foot buffer area of selective logging leaving no less than 30 percent of the original standing timber; and

c. Vegetation sufficient to stabilize the soil shall be established on all disturbed areas. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.40.120 Bridge Creek Reservoir buffer.

A 500-foot reservoir buffer must be maintained from the banks of the Bridge Creek Reservoir, measured at normal full water level. The reservoir buffer must remain in undisturbed natural vegetation. The facilities and improvements of the City water utility are exempt from this section. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.40.130 Exceptions to buffers.

a. A conditional use permit is required for any intrusion into a required buffer including, but not limited, to those intrusions and exceptions listed in HCC 21.40.110(b). When any approved intrusion into a buffer involves excavation or clearing, the conditional use permit must require the disturbed area to be revegetated immediately.

b. Upon application of the property owner, the Planning Commission may grant a conditional use permit to reduce the reservoir buffer requirements on a case-by-case basis only if it finds that:

1. The full reservoir buffer would result in an exceptional hardship, depriving the property owner of the economic advantages of ownership, i.e., all potential for appreciation and all opportunity for development of the property. Mere failure to realize the maximum appreciation or full development potential from the property shall not be considered an exceptional hardship.

2. The intrusion into the reservoir buffer is the minimum necessary to relieve that exceptional hardship.

3. The intrusion will not cause a degradation of the water quality or endanger the suitability of the Bridge Creek Reservoir as a water supply source for the City’s public water utility.

In making such findings, the Planning Commission must consider topography, water quality protection, erosion potential, surrounding uses, the size of the parcel, and any other relevant factors. A site plan and an erosion and sediment control plan must be provided by the property owner. The Planning Commission must impose any conditions necessary to protect the water quality and ensure continued suitability of the Bridge Creek Reservoir as a water supply source for the City’s public water utility.

c. Upon application of the property owner, the Planning Commission may grant a conditional use permit, on a case-by-case basis, to pipe an intermittent or perennial stream, thereby reducing or eliminating stream buffer requirements, only if it finds that:

1. For intermittent streams, the owner demonstrates that such piping is necessary to allow reasonable use of the property or for purposes of public safety.

2. For perennial streams, the owner or applicant demonstrates that use of the property without such piping will cause an exceptional hardship, depriving the property owner of the economic advantages of ownership, i.e., all potential for appreciation and all opportunity for development of the property. Mere failure to realize the maximum appreciation or full development potential from the property shall not be considered an exceptional hardship.

3. The intrusion will not cause a degradation of the water quality or endanger the suitability of the Bridge Creek Reservoir as a water supply source for the City’s public water utility.

If the Planning Commission approves a conditional use permit for stream piping, it must impose conditions requiring a vegetated buffer area or other device approved by the Public Works Director to protect the stream at any intake structure and other conditions as necessary to control erosion and sedimentation. All buffers and physical improvements related to the stream piping must be located entirely on the affected property or on easements adjacent to the property. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.40.135 Nonconforming lots, uses, and structures.

a. Except as otherwise provided in this section, lawfully subdivided lots, lawful existing uses, and lawfully constructed existing structures and improvements that are rendered unlawful by the adoption of this chapter or by any amendment to this chapter shall be treated as nonconforming.

b. No aspect of any nonconforming lot, use, structure, improvement, or any other kind of nonconformity in the BCWP district shall expand or increase in size or degree of nonconformance beyond the nonconformity existing on the effective date of the enactment that rendered it unlawful.

c. Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt ongoing activities or pending plats from the requirements of HCC 21.40.070(g) or to be an exemption from any other provision of this chapter that specifically applies to any activity or thing in progress on the effective date of the enactment.

d. Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow any preexisting or ongoing violation of HCC 21.40.140 to continue. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.40.140 Pollution prohibited.

No person shall pollute, poison, defile or corrupt the waters of the Bridge Creek Watershed nor throw or deposit offal, refuse, rubbish, garbage, dead animals, excrement, hazardous material, petroleum product, or any foul, offensive or noxious matter into the waters of the Bridge Creek Watershed or upon these waters when frozen, or upon the shores of these waters and the land constituting the watershed. No person shall cause, allow or permit any sewage, drainage, refuse or polluting matter that either by itself or in connection with other matter will tend to corrupt or impair the quality of the water of said watershed, or tend to render it injurious to health, to discharge, drain, percolate or permeate into the watershed. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.40.150 Enforcement.

a. In the event that any person holding a conditional use permit issued under this chapter violates the terms of the permit or any person implements site development in such a manner as to adversely affect or endanger the water quality in the Bridge Creek Watershed, the City Planner may issue a stop work order or suspend or revoke a conditional use permit. A stop work order or suspension of a conditional use permit may be imposed immediately and without prior notice to stop or prevent imminent material harm to the water quality; provided, that notice and a reasonable opportunity for a hearing must be provided promptly after the issuance of the order or suspension. A conditional use permit may be revoked permanently or suspended for longer than 30 days only after notice and a reasonable opportunity for a hearing. A revocation or suspension of a conditional use permit for longer than 30 days must be done by written decision.

b. The City may also issue other stop work orders and take other enforcement actions under Chapter 21.90 HCC.

c. The City may also exercise one or more other legal, equitable or other remedies available to it, including, but not limited to, criminal prosecution and the imposition of civil penalties by the City Manager under HCC 1.16.020.

d. In addition to the penalties provided for herein, the City may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order upon the parties responsible to cease any use or activity, or to re-establish or restore any or all of the grade, slope, stability, vegetation, drainage and other features and systems of a property in order to eliminate or prevent an adverse impact upon any adjacent or subservient property located in the Bridge Creek Watershed or to prevent degradation of the water quality, and for such other and further relief as may be appropriate in the circumstances. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].

a. This chapter designates and classifies ecologically sensitive and hazardous areas, protects the functions and values of the areas, and provides the means for additional review and protection to ensure the continued growth in a safe, orderly fashion for the greater health, welfare and safety of all Homer residents.

b. The purpose of the chapter is to protect the public from flooding and other natural hazards, to minimize the need for emergency rescue, to protect unique, fragile, and vulnerable elements of the environment, to minimize the cost of replacing public facilities, to alert the public of these critical areas, to avoid public subsidy of private development impacts, to assist property owners in developing their property by promoting innovative land use techniques, and to work in concert with other land use regulations. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.020 Applicability.

This chapter applies to all lands within the City of Homer and the Bridge Creek Watershed Protection District that contain area of special flood hazard, including coastal hazard areas, and to all development on those lands. This chapter constitutes an overlay district, and the regulations in this chapter apply to lands in that overlay district in combination with the regulations of the underlying zoning districts. This chapter imposes regulations and standards in addition to what is required by the underlying zoning district(s). [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.030 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall be defined as follows:

“Accessory structures” means buildings such as detached garages and boat houses, that are not designed or intended for human habitation.

“Appeal” means a request for a review of the interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater chance of flooding. The base flood depths range from one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.

“Area of special flood hazard” means the land in the floodplain within the City subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on maps always includes the letter A or V. The term “special flood hazard area” is interchangeable with this definition. This area is often referred to as the 100-year floodplain.

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the “100-year flood.”

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

“Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

“Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on the FIRM as Zone V1-V30, VE, V and LiMWA.

“Critical facility” means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to: schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, installations that produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste, access roads, water supply, power, communications and other public utility facilities that are vital to maintaining or restoring services.

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, or any other activity which results in the removal of substantial amounts of vegetation or in the alteration of nature site characteristics located within the area of special flood hazard or coastal high hazard area.

“Elevated building” means, for insurance purposes, a nonbasement building which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, post, piers, pilings, or columns.

“Federal Emergency Management Agency” or “FEMA” is the agency responsible for administration of the National Flood Insurance Program.

“Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from one or both of the following:

1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters.

2. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

“Flood Insurance Rate Map” or “FIRM” means an official map of the City issued by the Federal Insurance Administrator which delineates both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones.

“Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height, usually one foot, at any point.

“Functionally dependent use” means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This term includes only docking facilities and port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than the basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found at HCC 21.41.220(a).

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term “manufactured home” also includes recreational vehicles, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term “manufactured home” does not include recreational vehicles, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.

“One-hundred-year flood” (also called “regulatory flood,” “base flood” or “special flood hazard area”) (see “base flood”) means a flood of a magnitude which can be expected to occur on an average of once every 100 years. It is possible for this size flood to occur during any year, and possibly in successive years. It would have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. Statistical analysis of available stream flow or storm records, or analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics of the watershed, or topography and storm characteristics are used to determine the extent and depth of the 100-year flood.

Special Flood Hazard Area. See “area of special flood hazard.”

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including liquid or gas storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home that is principally above ground.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct violations that have been previously cited based on State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of a “historic structure” listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

“Variance” means a grant of relief by the City from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

“Water-dependent” means a structure for commerce or industry, which cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water because of the intrinsic nature of its operations. [Ord. 13-32 § 1, 2013; Ord. 09-38, 2009; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.040 Basis for establishing flood hazard areas.

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for the Kenai Peninsula Borough and Incorporated Areas, Alaska,” dated October 20, 2016, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and FIRM are on file in the Planning Department. [Ord. 16-33 § 1, 2016; Ord. 13-32 § 2, 2013; Ord. 09-38, 2009].


21.41.050 Warning – No liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Homer, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.060 Noncompliance – Violations – Enforcement.

a. No structure or land shall after April 29, 2003, be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.

b. Violations of this chapter are infractions, and are subject to criminal penalties pursuant to Chapter 1.16 HCC.

c. In addition, the City may take any other lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy any violation, including but not limited to all enforcement and civil remedies available under this title and Chapter 1.16 HCC. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.070 Development permit required.

A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within special flood hazard areas established in HCC 21.41.040. The permit shall be for all development as defined by HCC 21.41.030. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the City and shall include but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:

a. Elevations to be determined by registered State land surveyors in relation to North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88, the vertical datum used as a reference in the Flood Insurance Study for flood, ground, and structure elevations) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures;

b. Elevation in relation to NAVD88 to which any structure has been floodproofed;

c. Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in HCC 21.41.220(b);

5. It is the responsibility of the subdivider to provide all necessary information regarding flood protection measures at the time the preliminary plat is presented for consideration by the Planning Commission.

e. Review of Development Permits.

1. Where elevation data is not available, applications for development permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding.

2. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, and other evidence where available. [Ord. 13-32 § 3, 2013; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.220 Standards – Where base flood elevation data is provided.

In all flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in HCC 21.41.040 the following provisions are required:

a. Residential Construction.

1. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation.

2. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

a. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are to be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage.

b. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

c. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

d. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices if they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

b. Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot above base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

1. Be floodproofed so that one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

2. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

3. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in HCC 21.41.090(d)(2);

4. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standard for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection (a)(2) of this section;

5. Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below that level).

c. Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of HCC 21.41.200(a).

d. Recreational Vehicles. A recreational vehicle placed on a site within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the City’s FIRM either must:

1. Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

3. Meet the requirements of subsection (c) of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. [Ord. 13-32 § 4, 2013; Ord. 09-38, 2009; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.230 Standards – Floodways.

Located within flood hazard areas established in HCC 21.41.040 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to erosion potential and the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, the following provisions apply:

a. All encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, are prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

b. If subsection (a) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of HCC 21.41.200 through 21.41.250. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.240 Standards – Shallow flooding areas.

Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet above ground where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:

a. New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures and manufactured homes within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest grade adjacent to the building, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).

b. New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either:

1. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or

2. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer as in HCC 21.41.220(b)(3).

c. Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes must guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

d. A recreational vehicle placed on a site within AO Zones must either:

1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

3. Meet the requirements of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes.

e. A minimum of two openings on at least two different walls of the enclosure must be installed. The bottom of the openings must be no higher than one foot above grade. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.250 Standards – Coastal high hazard areas.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in HCC 21.41.040 are coastal high hazard areas, designated as Zones V1-V30, VE or V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all other provisions in this chapter, the following provisions shall also apply:

a. All new construction and substantial improvements in Zones V1-V30 and VE (V if base flood elevation data is unavailable) shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that:

1. The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated one foot or more above the base flood level; and

2. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto are anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

b. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

c. The developer shall obtain and provide to the Planning Department the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in Zones V1-30 and VE, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The Planning Department shall maintain a record of all such information.

d. All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide.

e. All new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or State codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:

1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

2. The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

f. If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation.

g. The use of fill for structural support of buildings is prohibited.

h. Manmade alteration of sand dunes that would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.

i. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones V1-V30, V, and VE on the FIRM shall meet the standards of subsections (a) through (h) of this section and shall meet the requirements of HCC 21.41.220(c).

j. A recreational vehicle placed on a site within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the FIRM shall either:

1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

3. Meet the requirements of HCC 21.41.070 and subsections (a) through (h) of this section. [Ord. 09-38, 2009; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.300 Variances – Planning Commission.

The Homer Planning Commission shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.310 Variances – Factors considered.

In passing upon variance applications, the Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

e. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

f. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damages;

g. The compatibility of the proposed use with the existing and anticipated development;

h. The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program for that area;

i. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.320 Variances – Conditional approval.

Upon consideration of the factors of HCC 21.41.310 and the purposes of this chapter, the Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.330 Variances – Records and reports.

The Planning Department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.340 Variances – Conditions for granting.

a. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided HCC 21.41.310(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

b. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in HCC 21.41.300 through 21.41.340.

c. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

d. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

e. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

f. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.

g. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except HCC 21.41.340(a), and otherwise complies with HCC 21.41.200(a)(1) and (2).

h. Variances may, if a proper showing is made, be granted for functionally dependent uses.

i. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.41.400 Appeals.

a. The Planning Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Planning Department.

b. The Board of Adjustment or a hearing officer appointed by the City Manager shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Planning Commission.

c. Appeals under this chapter are governed by the requirements and procedures of Chapter 21.93 HCC. [Ord. 17-07(S-3)(A) § 1, 2017; Ord. 08-29, 2008].

b. This chapter imposes regulations and standards in addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s). [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.44.030 Slope development standards.

The following standards apply to all development activity on a site described in HCC 21.44.020:

a. No development activity, including clearing and grading, may occur before the issuance of a zoning permit under Chapter 21.70 HCC.

b. Area of Development.

1. Except where the City Engineer approves a site plan under HCC 21.44.050 that provides for a larger area of development, the area of development on a lot with an average slope:

a. Of 15 to 30 percent shall not exceed 25 percent of the total lot area.

b. Greater than 30 percent but less than 45 percent shall not exceed 10 percent of the total lot area.

2. The area of development on a lot with an average slope of 45 percent or greater shall not exceed the area of development described in a site plan approved by the City Engineer under HCC 21.44.050.

c. Setbacks. Subject to the exceptions to setback requirements in HCC 21.44.040, all development activity is subject to the following setback requirements:

1. No structure may be closer to the top of a ravine, steep slope or noncoastal bluff than the lesser of:

a. Forty feet; or

b. One-third of the height of the bluff or steep slope, but not less than 15 feet.

2. No structure may be closer than 15 feet to the toe of a bluff other than a coastal bluff.

3. No structure may be closer than 40 feet to the top of a coastal bluff and closer than 15 feet to the toe of a coastal bluff.

d. Natural Drainage. The site design and development activity shall not restrict natural drainage patterns, except as provided in this subsection.

1. To the maximum extent feasible, the natural surface drainage patterns unique to the topography and vegetation of the site shall be preserved. Natural surface drainage patterns may be modified only pursuant to a site plan approved by the City Engineer under HCC 21.44.050, and upon a showing that there will be no significant adverse environmental impacts on the site or on adjacent properties. If natural drainage patterns are modified, appropriate soil stabilization techniques shall be employed.

2. The site shall be graded as necessary to ensure that drainage flows away from all structures for a distance of at least 10 feet, especially where building pads are cut into hillsides.

3. The development activity shall not cause an adverse effect on adjacent land and surrounding drainage patterns.

e. Erosion Control.

1. Erosion control methods approved by the City Planner and City Engineer, including without limitation sediment traps, small dams and barriers, shall be used during construction and site development to protect water quality, control soil erosion and control the velocity of runoff.

2. Winter Erosion Control Blankets. If development on a slope is not stabilized by October 15th, erosion control blankets (or a product with equivalent performance characteristics) must be installed upon completion of the seasonal work, but no later than October 15th. The erosion control blankets shall remain in place until at least the following May.

3. Vegetation shall remain undisturbed except as necessary to construct improvements and to eliminate hazardous conditions, in which case it must be replanted with approved materials including ground cover, shrubs and trees. Native vegetation is preferred for replanting operations, and will be used where practicable.

4. Grading shall not alter the natural contours of the terrain except as necessary for building sites or to correct unsafe conditions. The locations of buildings and roads shall be planned to follow and conform to existing contours as nearly as possible. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.44.040 Exceptions to setback requirements.

a. Any of the following may be located within a setback required by HCC 21.44.030(c):

2. An unoccupied accessory structure having a building area not greater than 200 square feet that is no closer than 15 feet to the top of any bluff or ravine.

3. A boardwalk, sidewalk, foot path or stairway that provides access to a beach, bluff or accessory structure, and that is located at or within three feet above ground level.

4. Development activity that the City Planner determines is reasonably intended to stabilize an eroding coastal bluff.

b. No structure other than a structure described in subsection (a) of this section may be located in a required setback without a conditional use permit issued in accordance with Chapter 21.71 HCC and a site plan approved by the City Engineer under HCC 21.44.050. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.44.050 Site plan requirements for slope development.

a. No permit for development activity for which HCC 21.44.030 or 21.44.040(b) requires a site plan may be approved unless the City Engineer approves a site plan for the development activity that conforms to the requirements of this section. The City Engineer shall accept or reject the plan as submitted or may require that specific conditions be complied with in order for the plan to meet approval.

b. The site plan shall be prepared by a qualified geotechnical engineer licensed to practice in the State of Alaska and shall include the following information:

1. The location of all watercourses, water bodies, and wetlands within 100 feet of the location of the proposed development activity.

2. The location of all existing and proposed drainage structures and patterns.

3. Site topography shown by contours with a maximum vertical interval of five feet.

4. The location of all proposed and existing buildings, utilities (including on-site well and septic facilities), driveways and streets.

5. The location of all existing vegetation types including meadow, forest and scrub lands, identifying all areas of vegetation that will be removed as well as vegetation to be preserved or replaced. Specifications for revegetation shall also be included.

6. Specific methods that will be used to control soil erosion, sedimentation, and excessive stormwater runoff during and after construction.

2. Total open area shall be at least 1.1 times the total floor area;

3. For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, open area shall not include areas used for parking or maneuvering incidental to parking or vehicular access. Open area may include walkways, landscaped areas, sitting areas, recreation space, and other amenities. All open area shall be suitably improved for its intended use but open area containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved.

d. Common Open Space.

1. All or a portion of the open area may be set aside as common open space for the benefit, use and enjoyment of present and future residents of the development.

2. The development schedule that is part of the development plan must coordinate the improvement of the common open space with the construction of residential dwellings in the planned development.

3. For any areas to be held under any form of common ownership, a written description of the owner’s intentions for the creation of legally enforceable future maintenance provisions shall be submitted with the conditional use permit application. The description shall indicate whether membership of property owners in an association for maintenance of the common area will be mandatory.

e. Perimeter Requirements. If topographical or other barriers do not provide adequate privacy for uses adjacent to the PUD, the Commission may impose conditions to provide adequate privacy, including without limitation one or both of following requirements:

1. Structures located on the perimeter of the planned development must be set back a distance sufficient to protect the privacy of adjacent uses;

2. Structures on the perimeter must be permanently screened by a fence, wall or planting or other measures sufficient to protect the privacy of adjacent uses.

f. Dimensional Requirements. Dimensional requirements may be varied from the requirements of the district within which the PUD is located. All departures from those requirements will be evaluated against the following criteria:

1. Privacy. The minimum building spacing is one method of providing privacy within the dwelling unit. Where windows are placed in only one or two facing walls or there are no windows, or where the builder provides adequate screening for windows, or where the windows are at such a height or location to provide adequate privacy, the building spacing may be reduced.

2. Light and Air. The building spacing provides one method of ensuring that each room has adequate light and air. Building spacing may be reduced where there are no windows or very small window areas and where rooms have adequate provisions for light and air from another direction.

3. Use. Where areas between buildings are to be used as service yards for storage of trash, clotheslines or other utilitarian purposes for both buildings, then a reduction of building space permitting effective design of a utility space may be permitted. Kitchens and garages are suitable uses for rooms abutting such utility yards.

4. Building Configuration. Where building configuration is irregular so that the needs expressed in subsections (f)(1), (2), and (3) of this section are met by the building configuration, reduced building spacing may be permitted.

5. Front Yard. Where the PUD provides privacy by reducing traffic flow through street layouts such as cul-de-sacs, or by screening or planting, or by fencing the structure toward open space or a pedestrian way, or through the room layout, the right-of-way setback requirement may be reduced.

6. Lot Width. A minimum lot width is intended to prevent the construction of long, narrow buildings with inadequate privacy, light and air. There are situations as in cul-de-sacs, steep slopes or off-set lots where, because of lot configuration or topography, narrow or irregular lots provide the best possible design. Where the design is such that light, air and privacy can be provided, especially for living spaces and bedrooms, a narrower lot width may be permitted. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.52.060 Commercial, noncommercial and industrial PUDs.

a. Any PUD that contains any commercial, noncommercial, or industrial use shall comply with the requirements and conditions of this section. If residential use is included in the PUD, it shall also comply with HCC 21.52.050.

1. For purposes of this section, a commercial use is defined as an occupation, employment, or enterprise that is carried on for profit that is not an industrial use.

2. For purposes of this section, an industrial use is defined as a use engaged in the processing or manufacturing of materials or products, including processing, fabrication, assembly, treatment, packaging, storage, sales or distribution of such products.

3. For purposes of this section a noncommercial use is a use that is neither residential, commercial nor industrial.

b. A planned unit development that includes commercial, noncommercial or industrial uses shall comply with the following requirements and conditions:

1. The PUD site shall have direct access to an arterial or collector street.

2. Utilities, roads and other essential services must be constructed, installed and available for the immediate use of occupants of the PUD.

3. The PUD shall be developed with a unified architectural treatment in exterior building materials, colors and design features.

c. If topographical or other barriers do not provide adequate privacy for uses adjacent to the PUD, the Commission may impose conditions to provide adequate privacy, including without limitation one or both of following requirements:

1. Structures located on the perimeter of the planned development must be set back a distance sufficient to protect the privacy of adjacent uses;

2. Structures on the perimeter must be permanently screened by a fence, wall or planting or other measures sufficient to protect the privacy of adjacent uses.

d. Dimensional Requirements. Setbacks and distances between buildings within the development shall be at least equivalent to that required by the zoning district in which the PUD is located unless the applicant demonstrates that:

1. A better or more appropriate design can be achieved by not applying the provisions of the zoning district; and

2. Adherence to the dimensional requirements of the zoning district is not required in order to protect health, safety and welfare of the occupants of the development and the surrounding area.

e. The site development standards of HCC 21.50.030 shall be met. [Ord. 13-27 § 17, 2013; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.52.070 Time limit.

After a PUD conditional use permit and development plan are approved by the Commission, construction of the planned unit development must begin within two years of the approval of the conditional use permit. The Commission may extend the time to begin construction by not more than two additional years for good cause shown. If construction is not begun within such time, including any extensions granted, the conditional use permit and development plan approvals lapse, and the conditional use permit and development plan must be resubmitted to the Planning Commission for re-approval. After a lapse of one year or more, a new conditional use permit application and PUD development plan cannot be re-approved and must be submitted to the Commission as a new application for complete reconsideration. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].

The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning code regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. In computing the sign area under this section:

1. Sign area shall include the area of any tenant-specific motifs or architectural devices including, but not limited to, roof forms, canopies, awnings, building color or finish, striping or color bars.

2. The entire area of backlit translucent material, including backlit translucent light boxes, canopies, and awnings, shall be counted as a sign area.

b. Computations of Area of Multifaced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.

c. Computation of Height. See Chapter 21.05 HCC. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.60.060 Signs on private property.

a. Signs shall be allowed on private property in the City only in accordance with Table 1. If the letter “A” appears for a sign type in a column, such sign type is allowed without prior permit approval in the zoning district represented by that column. If the letter “P” appears for a sign type in a column, such sign type is allowed only with prior permit approval in the zoning district represented by that column. Special conditions may apply in some cases. If the letter “N” appears for a sign type in a column, such sign type is not allowed in the zoning district represented by that column under any circumstances. If the letters “PH” appear for a sign type in a column, such sign type is allowed in the zoning district represented by that column only with prior approval by the Commission after a public hearing.

b. Although permitted under subsection (a) of this section, a sign designated by an “A” or “P” in Table 1 shall be allowed only if:

1. The sum of the area of all building and freestanding signs on the lot does not exceed the maximum permitted sign area for the zoning district in which the lot is located as specified in Table 2; and

2. The characteristics of the sign conform to the limitations of Table 3, Permitted Sign Characteristics by Zoning District, and with any additional limitations on characteristics listed in Table 1 or Table 2.

If any action is taken that increases the degree or extent of the nonconformity with the code, the sign loses lawful nonconforming status and must be removed immediately. At the end of the period during which the lawfully nonconforming sign is allowed to remain in use, the sign shall either be removed or the owner must obtain a permit, if required, and complete all other steps and make any modifications necessary to bring it into full compliance with this code.

e. Notwithstanding the remainder of this section, a nonconforming banner or temporary sign shall be removed no later than May 1, 2012. [Ord. 12-01(S)(A) § 16, 2012].

Chapter 21.74 DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY PLAN

Sections:

21.74.010    Development activity plan – When required.

21.74.020    Development activity plan standards.


21.74.010 Development activity plan – When required.

a. This chapter applies to a development activity plan (DAP) when required by another provision of the zoning code.

b. When a DAP is required, no person shall do or cause to be done any development activity on the site without first obtaining a DAP approved by the City. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.74.020 Development activity plan standards.

The DAP shall provide for the control of stormwater discharges, the control of total suspended solids, and the control of other pollutants carried in runoff. The DAP shall address and satisfy each of the standards established in this section. These standards apply during construction and all other phases of development activity.

a. Stabilization and Sediment Trapping. All exposed or disturbed soils with grades exceeding 10 percent and soils exposed to concentrated surface runoff flows, including soil stockpiles, shall be stabilized in a way that protects soil from the erosive forces of weather and flowing water. Applicable practices include, but are not limited to, the installation of silt fences, vegetative establishment, mulching, plastic covering, and the early application of gravel base on areas to be paved. No soils shall remain unstabilized for more than three days. At all times of the year, the contractor shall have sufficient materials, equipment and labor on site to stabilize and prevent erosion from all disturbed areas before initiating or continuing work.

b. Delineation of Clearing and Easement Limits. Clearing limits, setbacks, buffers, and sensitive or critical areas such as steep slopes, wetlands and riparian corridors shall be clearly identified in the DAP, marked in the field, and inspected by the City prior to commencement of land clearing activities.

c. Protection of Adjacent Properties. Adjacent properties shall be protected from sediment deposition by appropriate use of vegetative buffer strips, sediment barriers or filters, dikes or mulching, or by a combination of these measures and other appropriate methods.

d. Timing and Stabilization of Sediment Trapping Measures. Sediment ponds and traps, perimeter dikes, sediment barriers and other approved methods intended to trap sediment on site shall be constructed as a first step. These methods shall be functional before additional land-disturbing activities take place. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall not remain unstabilized for more than three days.

e. Slope Stabilization. Cut and fill slopes shall be constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion. Roughened soil surfaces are preferred to smooth surfaces. Interceptors should be constructed at the top of long, steep slopes that have significant areas above that contribute runoff. Concentrated runoff should not be allowed to flow down the face of a cut or fill slope unless contained within an adequate channel or pipe slope drain. Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane, adequate drainage or other protection should be provided. In addition, slopes should be stabilized in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.

f. Controlling Off-Site Erosion. Properties and waterways downstream from development sites shall be protected from erosion due to increases in the volume, velocity, and peak flow rate of stormwater runoff from the development site by the implementation of appropriate methods to minimize adverse downstream impacts.

g. Stabilization of Conveyance Channels and Outlets. All temporary and permanent on-site conveyance channels shall be designed, constructed and stabilized to prevent erosion from the expected flow velocity from a two-year, three-hour duration storm for the post-development condition. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion of outlets, adjacent stream banks, slopes and downstream reaches shall be provided at the outlets of all conveyance systems.

h. Storm Drain Inlet Protection. All storm drain inlets made operable during construction shall be protected so that stormwater runoff shall not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment. After proper written application, the requirement for inlet protection may be waived by the City on a site-specific basis when the conveyance system downstream of the inlet discharges to an appropriate on-site sediment control method, including but not limited to sediment ponds or traps. The conveyance system will be adequately cleaned following site stabilization.

i. Underground Utility Construction. The construction of underground utility lines shall be limited, where feasible, to no more than 500 feet of open trench at any one time. Where consistent with safety and space considerations, excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of the trench. Dewatering devices shall discharge to an appropriate sediment trap or pond, preceded by adequate energy dissipation, prior to runoff leaving the site.

j. Constructed Access Routes. Wherever construction vehicle routes intersect paved roads, provisions must be made to minimize the transport of sediment (mud) and debris onto the paved road by use of approved methods. If sediment or debris is transported onto a road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly, as a minimum, at the end of each day. Sediment or debris shall be removed from roads by shoveling or sweeping and be transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. Street washing shall be allowed only after sediment is removed in this manner.

k. Removal of Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Methods. All temporary erosion and sediment control methods shall be removed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary methods are no longer needed. Trapped sediment shall be removed or stabilized on site. Disturbed soil areas resulting from removal of temporary methods shall be permanently stabilized. The removal of temporary erosion and sediment control methods may not be required for those projects, such as single-family developments, that will be followed by additional construction under a different permit. In these circumstances, the need for removing or retaining the measures will be evaluated on a site-specific basis.

l. Dewatering Construction Sites. Dewatering devices shall discharge into an appropriate sediment trap or pond designed to accept such a discharge, preceded by adequate energy dissipation, prior to runoff leaving the site.

m. Control of Pollutants Other Than Sediment on Construction Sites. All pollutants other than sediment that occur on site during construction shall be handled and legally disposed of in a manner that does not cause contamination of ground or surface waters. Pollutants of concern include, but are not limited to, fuels, lubricants, solvents, concrete by-products and construction materials.

n. Maintenance. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control methods shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function. The owner shall be responsible for assuring that any such facilities damaged during floods, storms or other adverse weather conditions are immediately returned to normal operating condition.

o. Erosion Control. Erosion control design storm event facilities designed for the control of erosion and sedimentation shall be designed for the erosion and sedimentation control design storm event, defined as the two-year, three-hour duration storm.

p. Changes in Site Topography.

1. The maximum surface gradient on any artificially created slope shall be two feet of horizontal run to one foot of vertical fall (2:1). This gradient may be increased to a steeper slope, if, in the judgment of the Director of Public Works, it has been demonstrated by the developer through engineering calculations performed by a qualified professional engineer that surface erosion at such a gradient can be controlled to that erosion rate equal to a properly stabilized 2:1 slope under the same conditions.

2. The developer shall, at all times, protect adjacent properties and public rights-of-way and easements from damage occurring during, or resulting from, grading operations. The developer shall restore public improvements damaged by the developer’s operations.

q. Correction of Defective Maintenance. If the developer or owner, or both, refuse or fail to adequately maintain and keep the erosion and sediment control facilities functional at all times, and the owner of the property is given seven days’ notice to perform the work necessary to make the facility functional and fails to do so, the City may use public funds to complete maintenance of the facilities at the cost of the developer and the property owner, who shall be jointly and severally liable for such costs.

r. Progress of Work. All work required or approved under this section shall proceed continuously to completion in an expeditious manner unless otherwise authorized by the Director of Public Works, with the intent that work may be halted, for example, due to weather conditions or the need to coordinate other construction on the project site. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].

2. If the estimated cost exceeds $7,500, a performance guaranty meeting the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.

b. A performance guaranty shall be in the form of either a surety bond from a company authorized to do such business in the State, or a cash deposit with the City. The terms of the performance guaranty shall provide that if the developer defaults in constructing and installing the mitigation methods and structures that are required to comply with the SWP, the City may draw upon the performance guaranty to cure the default, but that such a drawing does not relieve the developer of its obligation to comply with the SWP. The amount of the performance guaranty shall be equal to 150 percent of the engineer’s estimate of the cost of constructing and installing the mitigation methods and structures that are required to comply with the SWP.

c. When the engineer who prepared a SWP submits to the Department written post-construction documentation that the installed mitigation methods and structures meet the standards in HCC 21.75.020 and the requirements of the approved SWP, the City shall release the performance guaranty for the SWP.

[Ord. 14-56(A) § 2, 2015; Ord. 08-29, 2008].

Failure to appeal to the Planning Commission within 30 days of service shall constitute a waiver of all rights of appeal from the order. The procedure for appeals is set forth in Chapter 21.93 HCC.

d. During such time that an enforcement order is under appeal, no further use or development contrary to the order may continue.

e. Upon correction of the condition or termination of the activity that caused the issuance of an enforcement order under subsection (a) of this section, the officer who issued the order may terminate the order or issue written confirmation of satisfactory compliance with the order.

f. An enforcement order need not be issued before a prosecution or legal action is commenced with respect to a violation of the Homer Zoning Code, a regulation or a permit. The pendency of any proceeding regarding an enforcement order issued under subsection (a) of this section does not stay any prosecution or other legal action with respect to the violation that is the subject of the enforcement order. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.90.070 Abatement of nuisance.

a. Any use, activity, condition, property, or structure in violation of an enforcement order issued under HCC 21.90.060 that continues after the time for appeal from the enforcement order has passed, or if appealed, continues after all appeals are exhausted, is a public nuisance and may be abated by the City as provided in this section.

b. Before action is taken to abate a nuisance, a final warning notice shall be posted on the property and served personally or by certified mail with return receipt requested to the violator and the owner of record of the property. Unless enjoined by court order within 30 days of the posting and service of the final warning notice, the City Manager will proceed to abate the nuisance. If the City Manager finds it necessary to effectively abate the nuisance, he or she may cause the physical destruction or removal of the nuisance.

c. The City Manager shall cause to be kept an account of the cost, including incidental expenses, incurred by the City in the abatement of any nuisance. The City Manager will cause an invoice for collection to be sent to the violator and owner of record of the property specifying the nature and costs of the work performed. For purposes of this section, the term “incidental expenses” shall include but not be limited to the actual expenses and costs to the City in the preparation of the notices, specifications and contracts, work inspection, attorney fees, consultant fees and interest from the date of completion at the rate of 10 percent per annum.

d. The property owners of the property upon which the abatement occurred are liable to the City for the entire cost of the abatement. Such charges become a lien upon the real property upon which the abatement occurred. If the invoice for the costs of the abatement remains unpaid after 30 days from the invoice, the City Manager will record a notice of lien at the District Recorder’s office. The lien shall be subordinate to all State and municipal tax liens and existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same property and shall be prior and paramount to all other liens. The lien shall continue until the charges and all interest due and payable thereon are paid.

e. The lien created under this section may be enforced as provided in AS 34.35.005 through 34.35.045. The enforcement of the lien is a cumulative remedy and does not bar the collection of the charges for abatement or costs and attorney fees through a personal action. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.90.080 Civil remedies.

a. With respect to any violation of the Homer Zoning Code, a regulation or a permit, the City may bring a civil action for any or all of the following:

1. To enjoin or abate the violation. Upon application for injunctive relief and a finding that a person is in violation or threatening a violation, the Superior Court shall enjoin the violation.

2. To require the restoration of any structure, vegetation, land, water body or other thing upon the land that is destroyed, damaged, altered or removed in such violation.

3. To recover damages suffered because of the violation.

4. To recover, in addition to any injunctive or compensatory relief, a civil penalty, payable to the City, not exceeding $1,000 for each violation.

b. Whenever a written enforcement order is in effect that has not been appealed, or if appealed, remains in effect during an appeal or after all appeals are exhausted, and a violation continues to exist, the City Manager may:

1. Commence proceedings to cause the abatement of the violation pursuant to HCC 21.90.070; or

2. Assess an administrative fine, not exceeding $250.00 per day, for failure to comply with an enforcement order.

c. The remedies provided in this section are not exclusive, but are cumulative of all other remedies available at law or in equity.

d. Any person aggrieved by a violation of the Homer Zoning Code, a regulation or a permit may bring a civil action against the violator as provided in subsection (a) of this section. For purposes of this section, a person occupying or owning land within 300 feet of the perimeter of the parcel containing the violation is irrebuttably presumed to be a person aggrieved. The City shall not be responsible for the costs or fees of such an action, which shall be the sole responsibility of the person filing the action. [Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.90.090 Violations.

2. A party may elect to include a verbatim transcript of the testimony before the Planning Commission in the appeal record by making a written request to the City Clerk for a recording of the testimony within 14 days after the Clerk mails copies of the notice of appeal to the parties pursuant to HCC 21.93.080(d). The requesting party shall arrange and pay for the preparation of the transcript. Only a transcript prepared and certified as accurate by a qualified court reporter shall be accepted. The original transcript must be filed with the City Clerk to be provided to the hearing officer with the record on appeal.

b. The appellant, the applicant for the action or determination that is the subject of the appeal, the owner of the property that is the subject of the action or determination, and other parties who have entered an appearance shall be notified by mail when the record and transcript, if ordered, are complete. Any person may obtain a copy upon payment of the costs of reproduction and any applicable mailing costs. [Ord. 17-07(S-3)(A) § 13, 2017; Ord. 10-41(A) § 6, 2010; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.93.530 Written briefs.

a. Each party to the appeal (each appellant, cross-appellant, and respondent) may file with the City Clerk one opening brief not later than 20 days after the date of mailing the notice of the completion of the record on appeal. The brief shall be typed on eight-and-one-half-by-11-inch paper and shall include a statement of relevant facts contained in the record on appeal, with citations to the page numbers in the record, a clear statement of the party’s position regarding the allegations of error specified in the notice of appeal, and arguments citing points and legal authorities in support of such position.

c. Upon request, any person may obtain a copy of any brief upon payment of reproduction charges and any applicable cost of mailing.

d. Upon written request, and for good cause shown and when it appears to the City Clerk that other parties will not be unduly prejudiced by the delay, the City Clerk may grant an extension of time not to exceed five days for the filing of any brief. [Ord. 10-41(A) § 7, 2010; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.93.540 Appeal hearing.

a. The meeting at which the Board of Adjustment hears an appeal shall be open to the public. An appeal before the hearing officer shall also be open to the public. The City Attorney or another attorney acting as legal counsel to the Board shall be present at appeals before the Board of Adjustment.

b. Each party (each appellant, cross-appellant, and respondent) may present oral argument at the appeal hearing, subject to the order of presentation and time limitations that the Board of Adjustment or hearing officer adopts at the commencement of the hearing. The taking of testimony or other evidence is limited by HCC 21.93.510.

c. The Board of Adjustment or hearing officer may undertake deliberations immediately upon the conclusion of the hearing on appeal or may take the matter under advisement and meet at such other time as is convenient for deliberations until a decision is rendered. Deliberations need not be public. 

d. The Board of Adjustment or hearing officer may exercise his or her independent judgment on legal issues raised by the parties. “Legal issues” as used in this section are those matters that relate to the interpretation or construction of the zoning code, ordinances or other provisions of law.

e. The Board of Adjustment or hearing officer shall defer to the findings of the lower administrative body regarding disputed issues of fact. Findings of fact adopted expressly or by necessary implication by the lower body shall be considered as true if they are supported by substantial evidence. But findings of fact adopted by less than a majority of the lower administrative body shall not be given deference, and when reviewing such findings of fact the Board of Adjustment or hearing officer shall exercise independent judgment and may make their own findings of fact. If the lower administrative body fails to make a necessary finding of fact and substantial evidence exists in the record to enable the Board of Adjustment or hearing officer to make the finding of fact, they may do so in the exercise of their independent judgment, or, in the alternative, the Board of Adjustment or hearing officer may remand the matter for further proceedings. “Substantial evidence,” as used in this section, means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. [Ord. 17-07(S-3)(A) § 14, 2017; Ord. 10-41(A) § 8, 2010; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.93.550 Board of Adjustment or hearing officer decision.

a. The Board of Adjustment or hearing officer may affirm or reverse the decision of the lower administrative body in whole or in part. If the appeal is heard by the Board of Adjustment, a majority vote of the fully constituted Board is required to reverse or modify the action or determination appealed from. For the purpose of this section, the fully constituted Board shall not include those members who do not participate in the proceedings due to a conflict of interest or disqualifying ex parte contacts, disqualifying partiality, or other disqualification for cause. A decision affirming, reversing, or modifying the decision appealed from shall be in a form that finally disposes of the case on appeal, except where the case is remanded for further proceedings.

b. The Board may seek the assistance of legal counsel, City staff, or parties in the preparation of a decision or proposed findings of fact. [Ord. 17-07(S-3)(A) § 15, 2017; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.93.560 Remand.

a. The Board of Adjustment or hearing officer may remand the appeal to the lower administrative body when the Board or hearing officer determines that:

1. There is insufficient evidence in the record on an issue material to the decision of the case;

2. There has been a substantial procedural error that requires further consideration by the lower administrative body; or

3. There is other cause requiring further proceedings by the lower administrative body.

b. A decision remanding a case shall describe any issue upon which further evidence should be taken, and shall set forth any further directions the Board or hearing officer deems appropriate for the guidance of the lower administrative body.

c. The lower administrative body shall promptly act on the case upon remand in accordance with the decision of the Board of Adjustment or hearing officer. A case on remand has priority on the agenda of the lower administrative body, except cases remanded under HCC 21.93.510(a) are not entitled to priority. The applicant or owner of the property in question may waive the priority given by this subsection. [Ord. 17-07(S-3)(A) § 16, 2017; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.93.570 Other procedures.

If no specific procedure is prescribed by the code, the Board of Adjustment or hearing officer may proceed in an administrative appeal in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this title, statutes, and the Constitution. [Ord. 17-07(S-3)(A) § 17, 2017; Ord. 08-29, 2008].

Article IV. Conflicts of Interest and Ex Parte Contacts


21.93.700 Appeals – Conflict of interest.

a. A member of the Planning Commission, Board of Adjustment or a hearing officer appointed to hear an appeal from a Planning Commission decision may not participate in the deliberation or voting process of an appeal if, following the procedures set forth in this chapter, the Commission, or Board member or hearing officer is determined to have a substantial financial interest in the official action, as defined in Chapter 1.18 HCC. In the absence thereof, all Commission or Board members or a hearing officer shall participate in the deliberation and voting process unless excused pursuant to other provisions of this chapter.

b. When a financial interest of a member of the Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment is disclosed on the record, the remainder of the Commission or Board, respectively, shall determine whether the member should participate in the matter. If it is determined the member should participate, any action taken thereafter by the body shall be valid notwithstanding a later determination by a court, an appellate tribunal, or a hearing officer that the member should have been disqualified from participation because of a substantial financial interest in the matter; except the action shall be invalidated when the disqualified member’s vote was necessary to establish the required majority to approve the decision of the body. When a Commission or Board decision is invalidated because such vote was necessary to establish the required majority, the body shall commence new consideration of the matter beginning at the point where the Commission or Board, respectively, determines it is necessary to do so to eliminate the effect of the member’s improper participation.

c. A hearing officer shall disclose any substantial financial interest, personal bias or ex parte contact immediately upon being appointed by the City Manager and shall refrain from accepting the appointment if a substantial financial interest, personal bias or ex parte contact exists. If the substantial financial interest, personal bias or ex parte contact arises after the hearing officer’s appointment, he or she shall disclose his or her interest and shall be disqualified from serving as the hearing officer unless all parties waive any objection to the hearing officer.

d. For purposes of hearing an appeal, a quorum of the Commission is four members. If it is not possible to obtain a quorum of the Planning Commission to hear an appeal without the participation of members disqualified by reason of a substantial financial interest, then all members who would be so disqualified shall nevertheless participate in the appeal, including deliberations and voting, and the decision rendered in such a case shall be valid notwithstanding the participation of such members. This subsection shall not apply if the matter can be postponed to a later date (not later than 75 days after the appeal record is prepared) when the body can obtain a quorum of members who are not disqualified by a substantial financial interest. 

e. For purposes of hearing an appeal, a quorum of the Board is four members. If it is not possible to obtain a quorum of the Board to hear an appeal without the participation of members who have chosen to abstain or been disqualified by the Board due to substantial financial interest, bias or partiality, then the hearing shall be postponed and a hearing officer shall be appointed. A hearing officer appointed under this subsection shall conduct the rescheduled hearing no more than 60 days after the original hearing date except that the hearing officer may extend the hearing date for good cause shown. [Ord. 17-07(S-3)(A) § 18, 2017; Ord. 08-29, 2008].


21.93.710 Appeals – Ex parte communication prohibited.

a. No member of the Commission or Board of Adjustment or any hearing officer appointed by the City Manager to review a decision issued by the Commission shall have ex parte communication with any person. “Ex parte communication” means to communicate, directly or indirectly, with the appellant, other parties or persons affected by the appeal, or members of the public concerning an appeal or issues specifically presented in the notice of appeal, either before the appeal hearing or during any period of time the matter is under consideration or subject to reconsideration, without notice and opportunity for all parties to participate in the communication.

b. This section does not prohibit:

1. Members from discussing matters relating to the appeal among themselves.

2. Communications between municipal staff and Commission or Board members or the hearing officer where:

a. Such staff members are not themselves parties to the appeal; and

b. Such communications do not furnish, augment, diminish, or modify the evidence in the record on appeal.

3. Communications between the Commission or Board and its legal counsel.

c. If, before an appeal commences, a member of the Commission or Board receives an ex parte communication of a type that could not properly be received while an appeal is pending, the member shall disclose the communication in the manner prescribed in subsection (d) of this section at the first meeting of the Commission or Board at which the appeal is addressed.

d. A member of the Commission or Board who receives an ex parte communication at any time shall, at the first opportunity after the communication, place on the record of the pending matter all written communications received, all written responses to the communications, and a memorandum stating the substance of all oral communications received, all responses made, and the identity of each person from whom the member received an ex parte communication. Any party to the appeal desiring to rebut the ex parte communication must be granted a reasonable opportunity to do so if a request is promptly made.

e. If the Commission or Board determines in its discretion it is necessary to eliminate the harmful effect of an ex parte communication received in violation of this section, the Commission or Board may disqualify the member who received the communication from participation in the appeal. In addition, the Commission may impose appropriate sanctions, including default, against a party to the appeal for any violation of this section.

f. It is a violation, subject to penalties and other enforcement remedies under this title:

1. For any person to knowingly have or attempt to have ex parte communication with a Commission or Board or hearing officer in violation of subsection (a) of this section.

2. For any Commission or Board member or hearing officer to knowingly receive an ex parte communication in violation of subsection (a) of this section.

3. For any Commission or Board member to knowingly fail to place on the record any matter when and as required under subsections (c) and (d) of this section. [Ord. 17-07(S-3)(A) § 19, 2017; Ord. 08-29, 2008].

22.10.030 Definitions.

The following words and phrases shall have the meanings set forth in this section, unless otherwise provided or the context otherwise requires:

“Non-Motorized Transportation and Trail Plan” means the Homer Non-Motorized Transportation and Trail Plan (2004), adopted as an element of the Homer Comprehensive Plan by HCC 21.02.010(b).

“Non-motorized transportation corridor” means an easement or right-of-way designated for public use for pedestrian, bicycle, equestrian or other non-motorized means of transportation.

“Subdivision” means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, lease, or building development, including resubdivision.

1. Streets in all rights-of-way dedicated by the plat;

2. All other utilities and public improvements to be constructed in the rights-of-way and easements dedicated by the plat, including water, sewer, electric, communications, and gas lines, as applicable; and

Beyond a minimum of 60 feet, the subdivider may agree to a note attached to said subdivision plat providing sufficient setback to allow future expansion of the right-of-way without removal of improvements. Horizontal alignments are subject to City review; the City may require realignment of streets on proposed plats if the alignments do not conform to Chapter 11.04 HCC and the Design Criteria Manual. Final plat approval shall thus be subject to the approval of horizontal alignments by the City Public Works Engineer.

c. The subdivider shall dedicate easements or rights-of-way for sidewalks, bicycle paths or other non-motorized transportation facilities in areas identified as public access corridors in the Homer Non-Motorized Transportation and Trail Plan, other plans adopted by the City Council, or as required by the Kenai Peninsula Borough Code.

d. The City Council may accept the dedication of easements or rights-of-way for non-motorized transportation facilities that are not required by subsection (c) of this section, if the City Council determines that accepting the dedication would be consistent with the adopted plans of the City. [Ord. 10-57 § 10, 2011; Ord. 90-5, 1990].

a. All wire or cable facilities, including, but not limited to, electric power, telephone and telecommunications cables, providing permanent service in newly developed residential subdivisions shall be located underground throughout the subdivision at the expense of the subdivision developer.

Major modifications shall not include reconductoring, reinsulating or in-kind replacement. The provisions of this subsection shall apply equally to the abandonment of pole lines except that if one utility abandons a pole line another existing utility which shares that pole line may buy the pole line and continue to use the pole line for the acquiring utility’s cable facilities.

c. All extensions of utility wire or cable facilities including, but not limited to, electric power, telephone, and telecommunications cables for the purpose of providing such utility service to any land not served before that date by overhead cable facilities shall be installed only as provided by Chapter 14.50 HCC.

d. Appurtenances such as transformers, switching boxes, terminal boxes, meter cabinets, pedestals, ducts and other facilities necessary to underground utilities may be placed above ground.

e. Exceptions to the requirement of this section that utility cable facilities be placed underground may be approved by City Manager or designee for good cause shown including, but not limited to, the following:
