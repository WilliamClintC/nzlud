alleged civil code infractions(s), the location of the alleged civil code
infraction(s), and the civil code infraction(s) alleged by town code or
ordinance section number and description.  The complaint shall be signed by
the Town Attorney or Town Prosecutor before the Civil Hearing Officer upon
the Town Attorney’s or Town Prosecutor’s avowal that he/she has
reasonable grounds to believe that the named defendant committed the civil
code infractions described in the complaint.  When a complaint alleging a
civil code infraction has been filed by the Town Attorney or Town Prosecutor,
the Civil Hearing Officer shall issue a notice of hearing which shall specify
a location, date, and time at least ten days following the filing of the
complaint, at which the defendant shall appear to admit or deny the
allegations contained therein.  The Civil Hearing Officer shall then cause
the notice of hearing, together with a copy of the complaint, to be served on
the defendant in the manner set forth in subdivisions (C)(1), (2), (3), or
(4) above.



   (G)   A person served with a notice of hearing for a civil code
infraction shall appear at the time and place set forth in the notice of
hearing or may appear prior to the time and upon the directions contained in
the notice of hearing to admit or deny the allegations of the complaint. 
Allegations not denied at the time of appearance are deemed admitted.



   (H)   If the allegations are admitted, the Civil Hearing Officer
shall enter judgment for the town and may impose a civil sanction pursuant to
§ 10.99(A) and costs of service against the defendant.  The Civil Hearing
Officer shall also order the abatement of the civil code infraction, unless
it has been abated by the date of a finding of responsibility therefor.



   (I)   If the defendants(s) denies any allegation contained in the
complaint, the Civil Hearing Officer shall set the matter for a civil code
infraction hearing.  Civil code infraction hearings shall be informal and
held without a jury, and the town is required to prove the violation charged
by a preponderance of the evidence.  Technical rules of evidence shall not
apply in such hearings, except for rules concerning relevancy and privileged
communications.  If the defendant elects to be represented by counsel, the
defendant shall so notify the Civil Hearing Officer at least ten days prior
to the hearing date.  In cases where the defendant elects to be represented
by counsel, the town may also be represented by the Town Attorney or Town
Prosecutor, provided that the Town Attorney or Town Prosecutor notifies the
Civil Hearing Officer and defendant’s counsel at least three days prior to
the hearing date.  Hearings shall be electronically recorded by the Civil
Hearing Officer.  If the Civil Hearing Officer finds in favor of the
defendant, the Civil Hearing Officer shall enter an order dismissing  the
complaint.  If the Civil Hearing Officer finds in favor or the town, the
Civil Hearing Officer shall enter judgment for the town and may impose a
civil sanction pursuant to § 10.99(A) and costs of service against the
defendant.  The Civil Hearing Officer shall also order the abatement of the
civil code infraction, unless it has been abated by the date of entry of such
judgment.



   (J)   If a person served with a complaint and notice of hearing
fails to appear on or before the date and time directed in the notice of
hearing, or at such other time as may be directed by the Civil Hearing
Officer, the allegations contained in the complaint shall be deemed admitted,
and the Civil Hearing Officer shall enter judgment for the town and may
impose a civil sanction pursuant to § 10.99(A) and costs of service against
the defendant.



   (K)   Any person against whom judgment is entered for a civil code
infraction, or against whom a civil sanction is imposed for such infraction,
may seek judicial review of such judgment or sanction by way of special
action to the Maricopa County Superior Court.

services recovery fee, or other court fee or cost defaults in the payment of
such or of any installment, the Clerk of the Court shall notify the

order.  The Court, on motion of the Prosecuting Attorney, on petition of any
person entitled to payment pursuant to a court order, or on its own motion,
may require the defendant to show cause why the defendant's default should
not be treated as contempt and may issue a summons or a warrant of arrest for
the defendant's appearance.



   (B)   Unless the defendant shows that the default was not
attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the Court or an
intentional refusal on the defendant's part to make a good faith effort to
obtain the monies required for the payment, the Court shall find that the
default constitutes contempt and may order the defendant incarcerated until
the payment, or a specified part thereof, is paid, or revoke the defendant's
probation or parole and sentence the defendant pursuant to law.



   (C)   If the Court finds that the default is not intentional, but
that the defendant cannot pay despite sufficient good faith efforts to obtain
the monies, the Court may take any lawful action, including any of the
following:



      (1)   Modifying the manner in which the payment is to be paid.



      (2)   Entering any reasonable order which would assure
compliance with the order to pay.

pursuant to a court order to take whatever measures for the collection
thereof of the unpaid balance as are authorized for the collection of an
unpaid civil judgment entered against the defendant in an action on a debt. 
Any levy or execution for collection does not discharge a defendant
incarcerated for non-payment until the amount of the fine, restitution, jail
services recovery fee, or other fee or cost is fully collected.



   (D)   If a fine, restitution, jail services recovery fee, or other
fee or cost is imposed on an enterprise, it is the duty of the person or
persons authorized to make disbursement from the assets of the enterprise to
pay from those assets and their failure to do shall be held a contempt unless
they make the showing required in division (B) above.

items or services.



(`87 Code, § 3-4-9)



§ 37.02  PROCEDURE GENERALLY.



   The Town Manager and his or her designee(s) shall be the Purchasing

for services is for the sum of less than $5,000 the Purchasing Agent may

   (B)   $5,000 to under $25,000.   Whenever any contemplated purchase
or contract for services is for the sum of at least $5,000 but less than
$25,000, the Purchasing Agent shall solicit at least two bids for the item or
service.  Said solicitation may be orally obtained, then documented in
writing by him or her, and he or she may then award the purchase or contract
of service to the lowest responsible bidder.



   (C)   $25,000 to the bid limit established pursuant to the State
Procurement Code (A.R.S. § 41-2501 et seq.) or the bid limit set by A.R.S.§
34-201 for public work expenditures.  Whenever any contemplated purchase or
contract for services is for the sum of at least $25,000 and no more than the
allowable limit as set by Arizona Revised Statutes, the Purchasing Agent
shall solicit at least three written bids for the item or service on bid
forms and award the purchase or contract of services to the lowest
responsible bidder.



   (D)   No contract of $25,000 or more shall be approved except by the
Town Council. Whenever any contemplated purchase or contract for services is
for the sum of $25,000 or more, the Purchasing Agent shall present the bids
to the Town Council for approval, and advise the Town Council of the
advantages or disadvantages of contract and bid proposals.



   (E)   Expenditures over the bid limit established pursuant to the
State Procurement Code (A.R.S.  § 41-2501 et seq.) or over the bid limit
set by A.R.S. § 34-201 for public works expenditures. Whenever required by
Arizona Revised Statutes, the Purchasing Agent shall cause to be published,
in two issues of a newspaper of general circulation in the town, notice
inviting bids, which notice shall be published as provided in A.R.S. §
39-204.  The notice shall include a general description of the articles to
be purchased or services to be performed and the time and place for opening
bids.  In addition, the Purchasing Agent shall post a notice inviting bids
in the Town Hall and may also mail to all responsible prospective suppliers a
copy of the notice inserted in the newspaper.

of the Town Council.



   (B)   Approval required.  No public sewer extensions shall be made
until the plans and specifications are approved by the authorized officers of
the town.



   (C)   In subdivisions.  In new subdivisions where public sewer
extensions are authorized by the town and constructed at the subdivider's
expense, the town may authorize the subdivider or his or her agent, if he or
she so desires, to install building connections with wyes and connect the
building sewers to the building connection under the following provisions:



      (1)   The construction of the public sewer, building
connections, and connections of the building sewers to the building
connection shall be in compliance with Maricopa Association of Governments
(MAG) Standards and Specifications under the supervision of a registered
civil engineer holding a currently active registration in the state, who
shall submit “as built plans” bearing the registered civil engineer's
registration seal and number to the Manager.  It shall be the duty of the
registered civil engineer employed by the subdivider to require that all
building connections serving lots in the subdivision upon which no buildings
are constructed be sealed.  Such sealed connections shall be inspected and
approved by the authorized officer of the town before being backfilled and
shall be marked in the field, located, and designated on the “as built
plans.”  The effective seal shall consist of a vitrified clay, or equal
stopper, inserted in the bell of the sewer extending to the property line in
the alley or to the curb line in the street from the public sewer.  Such
stopper shall be jointed according to the specifications and standard details
used by the MAG or subsequent revision thereof.  The stopper shall be
permanently flagged by attaching one end of a length of copper wire to the
stopper and the other end to a broken piece of clay pipe, which shall be
placed under the soil surface directly over the end of sewer pipe.



      (2)   Before any sewer construction is commenced, the
necessary approvals and permits must be obtained by the subdivider or his or
her agent from the properly authorized officer of the town.



      (3)   When the “as built plans” are submitted to the town,
the Engineer will make a record of the building connections.  The Engineer
shall notify the properly authorized officer of the connections to ascertain
that all requirements of the town have been fulfilled.



      (4)   A deposit in cash, certified check, or bond in the
amount of 100% of the Engineer's estimated cost of the public sewer extension
and building connections shall be paid by the subdivider or his or her agent
to the Town Manager before commencing any construction to ascertain that the
provisions of this section are fulfilled.  Upon acceptance of the “as
built plans” by the Engineer and a satisfactory report by the authorized
inspector, the deposit will be promptly refunded to the subdivider or his or
her agent without interest.  Should the subdivider or his agent fail to
comply with the foregoing provisions, the deposit shall be forfeited by the
subdivider or his or her agent and used by the town to complete the approved
construction.



      (5)   (a)   Except for single-family residential units, no
privately owned sewer systems and/or treatment plants or facilities of any
sort for the treatment of wastewater shall be allowed in any new subdivision
within the town.



         (b)   In addition, no more than one single-family
residential unit shall be allowed to introduce wastewater into any type of
privately owned wastewater treatment facility that is permitted within a new
subdivision by this chapter.

CONNECTIONS



§ 50.025  DUTIES AND LIABILITY OF CONSUMER.



   (A)   Building or house sewer connections on the consumer's premises
shall be so arranged as to provide service to one lot.  If additional
service is required it will be considered as a separate and individual
account.



   (B)   The consumer's house or building service line, sewer
connection, and apparatus shall be installed and maintained by the consumer,
at the consumer's expense, in a safe and efficient manner and in accordance
with the town's rules and regulations as found in § 50.030, and in full
compliance with the regulations of the State Department of Environmental
Quality.  Failure to comply with such regulations relieves the town from any
and all liability from injury or damage proximately caused therefrom.



   (C)   The consumer shall safeguard the town's property placed on the
consumer's premises and shall permit access to it only by the authorized
representatives of the town.



   (D)   In the event that any loss or damage to the property of the
town or any accident or injury to persons or property is caused by or results
from the negligence or wrongful act of the consumer or his or her agents or
employees, the cost of necessary repairs or replacements shall be paid by the
consumer to the town and any liability otherwise resulting shall be assumed
by the consumer.  The amount of such loss or damage and the cost of repairs
may be added to the consumer's bill, and, if not paid, service may be
discontinued after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing as
specified in § 50.108.



   (E)   When service to a consumer shall require the laying of any
town sewer lines or the installation of any other town property on, under,
across, or over the consumer's property, the consumer shall grant to the town
an easement, right-of-way, or license for such installation, and that grant
shall be a condition precedent to sewer service.

§ 50.027  PERMITS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION.



   All applications for building permits required for new construction of
a residential or commercial building must first be submitted to the Town
Engineer to determine if the building to be authorized by the permit will
require a connection to the town's wastewater system.  If the Town Engineer
determines the building to be permitted will require connection to the town's
wastewater system, the applicant shall immediately make application to the
town for a sewer connection on forms approved by the town.  This application
for sewer connection shall be attached to the building permit.  The property
for which the building permit has been granted shall be liable for any and
all applicable fees as set forth in this chapter. All applicable sewer fees
and charges must be paid prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

line is not available to a property owner wishing to connect to the public
wastewater system, the property owner may petition the town to make the
necessary sewer line extensions and improvements needed to allow connection
to the public wastewater system.  These improvements shall be at the
property owner's expense.  The property owner shall provide plans and
specifications for town approval for any extension or improvement to the
public wastewater system.  In addition, the property owner shall supply to
the town a complete set of plans and specifications reflecting the “as
built” conditions of any extension or improvement to the public wastewater
system.  The property owner may request from the town and the town may
provide plans and specifications for any extension or improvement to the
public wastewater system, but, under any circumstance, the property owner
shall still be liable for any fees set by the town.  If the town agrees to
provide plans and specifications for any proposed wastewater extension or
improvement, the property owner shall be liable for all costs associated with
the providing of such plans and specifications.  The associated costs shall
include, but not be limited to, engineering design and technical writings,
legal, administrative, and construction-related costs, and advertising.  If
any property owner provides the town with plans and specifications for any
wastewater extension and improvement, the property owner shall still be
liable for any fees set by the town, and, in addition, the property owner
shall also be liable for any cost incurred by the town for review and
approval of any plans and specifications for any wastewater extension and
improvement submitted to the town.  The property owner shall also provide,
at no charge to the town, the necessary easements required by the town for
any wastewater extension or improvement.

town's wastewater system shall be liable for any and all sewer fees
established by proper and legal action of the town, either by action of the
Town Council or through official town administrative policies or procedures,
whether or not each individual user is connected directly to the town's
wastewater system or the connection is made through a common sewer pipe which
may serve more than one individual user.  If any connection to the town's
wastewater system is made by the use of any type or form of a common sewer
pipe connection, plan, or scheme, the entire common sewer pipe connection,
plan, or scheme shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.

   In the event a customer fails to pay any sum due the town under the
provisions of this chapter, the town shall have a lien on the real property
to which the service is provided for the amount of any such unpaid sums. 
The lien shall exist for a period of five years from and after a claim for
lien is filed in the public records of the county.  Such lien must be filed
within one year after the due date of the payments included therein, and any
action to foreclose such lien shall be filed in the Superior Court of
Arizona, Maricopa County, Arizona, within five years from the date such lien
is filed in such county and shall be foreclosed in the same manner as a
judicial foreclosure of a mortgage on real estate and in accordance with the
rules applicable thereto.  The town shall be entitled to recover its
reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in the foreclosure of any such
lien.  Where the property owner of the property subject to this lien is
other than the customer, the town shall give to the owner of record of the
property to which service was provided written notice of intent to file the
lien herein at least 30 days prior to the filing thereof and, if the sum due
for which said lien is claimed is paid prior to the expiration of said 30-day
period, no such lien shall be filed for the amount paid.  Such notice shall
be given through the United States Mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the
address of the owner of such property as appears on the Assessor's records
for such property.  Upon payment of any such lien, the Town Manager or his
or her designee is authorized to release said lien for and on behalf of the
town.

incorporated herein (“Property”).



   (ii)   The parties acknowledge that the Town is currently in the
process of causing the development and completion of a new public wastewater
sewer service treatment plant (“New Town Plant”), which, upon completion
and commencement of operation, will be able to provide wastewater treatment
services to portions of real property situated within the Town.



   (iii)   In the interim, it is the desire and intent of the Town to
enter into this Agreement with the owner, whereby the Town will provide
wastewater treatment services for the Property by utilizing the expanded
capacity set forth in that certain Agreement entered into by and between the
Town and Cave Creek Sewer Company, Inc., an Arizona Corporation (“CCSC”),
dated February 9, 1993, subject to such expanded capacity becoming available
after the existing plant is expanded and after current and Cave Creek Sewer
Improvement District Number 2 users and those who have purchased capacity
guarantees have been served.



   (iv)   Accordingly, it is the desire and intent of the parties
hereto to enter into this Permanent Wastewater Treatment Service Agreement to
set forth the terms and conditions whereby the Town will accept and seek
approval to add the Property to its wastewater planning area; will provide
wastewater treatment services to the Property on an interim basis by
utilizing the expanded Plant capacity of CCSC subject to and insofar as such
expanded capacity is available, and will provide permanent wastewater
treatment services to the Property subject to and upon the completion and
commencement of operation of the New Town Plant.

pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405
through 471 are hereby incorporated and:



      (1)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed
only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in
wastewater, the town may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e);



      (2)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
town shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula
in 40 CFR 403.13;



      (3)   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical
pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its
discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when
developing the categorical pretreatment standard; and



      (4)   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment from EPA to a
categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.



   (B)   State pretreatment standards.  State pretreatment standards
and any other applicable state standards or requirements are hereby
incorporated.

may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the
concentration-based limitations above.



   (C)   No nonresidential user shall discharge wastewater containing
restricted substances into the wastewater system in excess of limitations
specified in its industrial wastewater discharge permit or adopted by
resolution by the town.  The town shall publish and revise from time to time
standards (local limits) for specific restricted substances.  These
standards shall be implemented within the objectives of this chapter. 
Standards published in accordance with this section will be deemed
pretreatment standards for the purpose of 307(d) of the Act (33 USC 1317(d)).

(Ord. 99-04, passed 2-16-99)



§ 51.044  ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.



   (A)   Notification of violation.  When the town finds that a user
or customer has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the town shall
serve upon a representative of the user or customer (such representative
meeting the criteria of authorized signatory) a written notice of
violation.  Within five days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof (to include specific actions) shall be submitted by the user to the
town.  Note that the submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user
for liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation.  Also, nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the town to take action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.



   (B)   Consent orders. The town may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing
an agreement with any user or customer to correct the noncompliance within a
time period specified by the document.  Such documents shall have the same
force and effect as the orders issued pursuant to this chapter and shall be
judicially enforceable.



   (C)   Show cause hearing.



      (1)   The town may order a user or customer which has violated
or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial

pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the town and show
cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.



      (2)   Notice may be served on the user or customer specifying
the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the
reasons for such an action, and a request that the user or customer show
cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  The notice
of the meeting may be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least 14 days prior to the hearing.  Such
notice may be served on a representative of the user who meets the criteria
of an authorized signatory.



      (3)   A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against or
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user or customer.



   (D)   Compliance orders.



      (1)   When the town finds that a user or customer has violated
or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the town may issue an order to the user
or customer responsible for the discharge, directing that the user or
customer come into compliance within a specified time.



      (2)   If the user does not come into compliance within the
time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated.



      (3)   Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged
to the sewer.



      (4)   A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a national pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user or customer of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation.



      (5)   Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against or prerequisite for taking any other action against the user or
customer.



   (E)   Cease and desist orders.



      (1)   When the town finds that a user or customer has violated
or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's or customer's past
violations are likely to recur, the town may issue an order to the user or
customer directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the user or customer to:



         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and



         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive
action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.



      (2)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user or
customer.



   (F)   Administrative fines.



      (1)   When the town finds that the user or customer has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the town may fine such user or customer
in an amount not to exceed $2,500.  Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis.  The town may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.



      (2)   Unpaid fines shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed
an additional penalty of 5% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue
thereafter at a rate of 10% per annum.  A lien against the user's or
customer's property (including but not limited to a judgement lien) may be
sought for unpaid fines.



      (3)   Users or customers desiring to dispute such fines must
file a written request for the town to reconsider the fine along with full
payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. 
Upon receipt of such request, the Town Manager (or his/her designee) shall
convene a hearing on the matter within 30 days of receiving the request.  In
the event the user's or customer's appeal is successful, the payment,
together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user
and customer.



      (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar
against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user or
customer.



   (G)   Emergency suspensions.



      (1)   The town may immediately suspend a user's or customer's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears
to be present or cause imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons.



      (2)   The town may also immediately suspend a user's or
customer's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens
to interfere with the operation of the wastewater system, or to which
presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.



      (3)   Any user or customer notified of a suspension of its
discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution.  In the
event of a user's or customer's failure to immediately comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the town shall take such steps as deemed necessary
(including immediate severance of the sewer connection) to prevent or
minimize damage to the wastewater system or its receiving stream, or any
endangerment to any individuals.  The town shall allow the user or customer
to recommence its discharge when the user or customer has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the town that the period of endangerment has passed, unless
the termination proceedings in division (H) of this section are initiated
against the user or customer.



      (4)   A user or customer that is responsible, in whole or in
part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a
detailed written statement to the town within five calendar days, describing
the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence.



      (5)   Nothing in division (C) of this section shall be
interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under
this section.



   (H)   Termination of discharge.  Any user or customer that violates
the requirements of this chapter is subject to discharge termination.  Such
user or customer shall be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (C) of
this section why the proposed action should not be taken.  Exercise of this
option by the town shall not be a bar to or a prerequisite for taking any
other action against the user or customer.



   (I)   Pumping and emergency remediation.  Any user or customer that
causes discharge that endangers the environment or the welfare of persons

   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including but not limited to
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a
non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential
problems for the wastewater system, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the town of the incident.  This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume (if
known), and corrective actions taken by the user.



   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user or
customer shall, unless waived by the town, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user or customer to prevent similar future occurrences.  Such notification
shall not relieve the user or customer of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater
system, natural resources or any other damage to persons or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the user or customer of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.



   (C)   Failure to notify the town of potential problem discharges
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.



   (D)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's or
customer's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of a discharge described in division (A) of this section.

   If a sampling performed by a user or customer indicates a violation,
the user or customer must notify the town as soon as possible but no later
than 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.  The user or customer
shall also immediately repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the town within the time period specified
by the town, but at no time greater than 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation.  The user or customer may not be required to resample if the town
monitors at the user's or customer's facility at least once a month, or if
the town samples between the user's or customer's initial sampling and when
the user receives the results of this sampling.

§ 51.128  NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.



   (A)   Any user or customer who commences the discharge of hazardous
waste shall notify the town, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities (in writing) of any discharge
into the wastewater system of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261.  Such notification must
include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the
EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or
other).  If the user or customer discharges more than 100 kilograms of such
waste per calendar month to the wastewater system, the notification shall
also contain the following information to the extent that such information is
known and readily available to the user or customer: an identification of the
hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.  All
notifications must take place no later than 100 days after the discharge
commences.



   (B)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous wastes or listing
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user or customer must notify
the town, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations.



   (C)   In the case of any notification made under this chapter, the
user or customer shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has been
determined to be economically practical.



   (D)   This reporting requirement does not create a right to
discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this
chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

§ 51.130  SAMPLE COLLECTION.



   (A)   Flow proportional sampling.  The user or customer must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques.  In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the
town may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four
grab samples where the user or customer demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.  In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge
limits.



   (B)   Grab sampling.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH,
cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.



   (C)   Timing.  Written reports will be deemed to have been
submitted on the date post-marked.  For reports which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.

   Users and customers subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain and make available for inspection and copying all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities
required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained
to monitoring activities undertaken by the user or customer independent of
such requirements.  Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and
time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed and who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques of methods used; and the results of such analyses.  These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three years.  This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or customer or the town, or where the user or customer has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the United States EPA,
the state, or the town.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING



§ 51.150  RIGHT OF ENTRY, INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.



   (A)   The town shall have the right upon presentation of proper
credentials to enter the premises of any user or customer to determine
whether the user or customer is complying with all requirements of this
chapter and any industrial wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder.  Users or customers shall allow the town ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.



   (B)   (1)   Where a user or customer has security measures in
force which require proper identification and clearance before entry onto its
premises, the user or customer shall make necessary arrangements with its
security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the
town will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing
specific responsibilities.



      (2)   The town shall have the right to set up on the user's or
customer's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's or customer's
operation.



      (3)   The town may require the user or customer to install
monitoring equipment.  The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by
the user or customer at its own expense.  All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually by a
certified technician to ensure their accuracy.  Calibration records shall be
made available to the town upon request.



      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user or customer at the written or verbal request of the
town.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user or
customer.



      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the town access to the
user's or customer's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.

§ 51.151  SEARCH WARRANTS.



   If the town has been refused access to a building, structure, or
property or any part thereof and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program of the town designed to verify compliance with this chapter, or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the town may seek issuance of a
search warrant.



(Ord. 99-04, passed 2-16-99)



§ 51.152  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.



   Information and data on a user or customer obtained from reports,
surveys, industrial wastewater discharge permit applications, industrial
wastewater permits, and monitoring programs, and from the town's inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the town that the release of such information would be a
misuse of public records because it would divulge information, processes, or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under
applicable state law.  Any such request must be asserted by the user at the
time of submission of the information or data.  When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that some or all the information
therein should be held confidential, those portions of the report shall not
be made available for public inspection but the town  shall, instead, take
reasonable steps in accordance with state law to obtain an order closing
those portions of the record to the inspection.  However, nothing herein
shall preclude the town from making such records available upon request to
governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report.  Note that wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
“effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.

§ 51.153  PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.



   (A)   The town may publish annually in the largest daily newspaper
published in the municipality where the wastewater treatment system is
located a list of users or customers which, during the past 12 months, were
in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.



   (B)   The term SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE shall mean:



      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater limits, defined as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a
six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the
same pollutant parameter by any amount;



      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here
as those in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product
of the daily limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
criteria:  1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except for pH;



      (3)   Any other discharge violation that the town believes has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass
through (including endangering the health of town personnel or the general
public);



      (4)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment or has resulted in the
town's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;



      (5)   Failure to meet within 90 days of the scheduled date a
compliance schedule milestone contained in the industrial wastewater
discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES



§ 51.170  UPSET.



   (A)   For the purpose of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user or customer.  An upset does not include noncompliance to
the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance
or careless or improper operation.



   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (C) of this section are met.



   (C)   A user or customer that wishes to establish the affirmative
defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other evidence that:



      (1)   An upset occurred and the user or customer can identify
the cause(s) of the upset;



      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent
and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and



      (3)   The user or customer has submitted the following
information to the town as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours of
becoming aware of the upset.  If this information is provided orally, a
written submission must be provided within five days:



         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause
of noncompliance;



         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including the exact
date and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance
is expected to continue; and



         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user or customer seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



   (E)   Users and customers will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.



   (F)   Users and customers shall control production of all discharges
to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility, until
the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.



(Ord. 99-04, passed 2-16-99)



§ 51.171  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.



   A user or customer shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement
action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions of this
chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference and that either:  a local limit exists
for each pollutant discharged and the user or customer was in compliance with
each limit prior to and during the pass  through or interference; or no
local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature
or constituents from the user's or customer's prior discharges when the town
was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.



(Ord. 99-04, passed 2-16-99)



§ 51.172  BYPASS.



   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.



      BYPASS.   The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's or customer's treatment facility.



      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE.   Substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.  SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.



   (B)   A user or customer may allow any bypass to occur which does
not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if
it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These
bypasses are not subject to divisions (C) and (D) of this section.



      (1)   If a user or customer knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the town at least ten days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.



      (2)   A user or customer shall submit oral notice to the town
of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards as
soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours from the time it becomes aware
of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including the exact date
and times; if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate,
and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The town may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24
hours.



   (C)   Bypasses are prohibited, and the town may take an enforcement
action against a user or customer for a bypass, unless:



      (1)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or severe property damage;



      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such
as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes,

§ 52.107  POLICY OF TOWN FOR EXTENSIONS.



   The water main extension policy of the town for town water mains and
the policy to be followed in connection therewith shall be, and the same is
hereby declared to be as follows:



   (A)   Developers must pay all costs for constructing mains of such
sizes as to afford adequate service during peak demands.



   (B)   The minimum water requirements will be per applicable state
and federal regulations.



   (C)   The Utilities Manager or his/her designee will review and
approve the required size and layout of public water mains that will meet
both domestic water needs and fire flow requirements as specified in the
Water and Wastewater Technical Design Guidelines.



   (D)   The Utility Department will not perform field engineering nor
submit detailed plans and specifications for any developer. This work is to
be performed by a civil engineer registered in the state and employed by the
developer. Before construction begins, final detailed plans and
specifications for the water main extensions in the development must be
approved by the Utility Department. The cost of staking the location of the
new water mains and the cost of inspecting the construction shall be assumed
by the developer. The town will perform the inspection during construction.



   (E)   Where booster pumps are necessary to maintain adequate
pressures in the mains due to the development being near or above the
hydraulic gradient of the distribution system of the town service area, the
developer shall construct, at his own expense, the necessary booster pumping
station and storage facilities to town specifications as addressed in the
town's Water and Wastewater Technical Design Guidelines. The town will assume
ownership, maintenance and operation of such booster pump installation upon
its completion and acceptance by the town.



   (F)   All extensions must comply with the town's Water Master Plan.



(Ord. O2011-03, passed 2-7-11)



§ 52.108  EXTENSIONS IN SUBDIVISIONS, SINGLE LOT, AND SUBLOT DEVELOPMENTS
AND ALL OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.



   (A)   In all new subdivisions and single lot developments, and all
other developments, where the town is to provide water service, the developer
shall furnish and install in accordance with plans approved by the Utilities
Manager all water mains, service connections, valves, fittings and
appurtenances within the boundary of the development as well as the streets
bounding the entire development. Review fees shall be paid as established by
Town Council resolution. In addition, the developer shall furnish and install
all off-site water mains as necessary to complete a looped connection, if
feasible, to existing town mains as determined by the Utilities Manager. All
water lines are to be constructed to conform to the town's Water Master Plan,
and are to be constructed as a general area improvement whether they do, or
do not, directly service the property being developed. For developments
principally residential in character, water infrastructure development shall
follow the town's Water and Wastewater Technical Design Guidelines.



   (B)   For all developments, fire hydrants, valves, pipe, and
fittings required for the hydrant installation shall also be installed by the
developer in accordance with plans approved by the Utilities Manager. Review
fees shall be paid as set forth in § 52.101(A)(5) of the Town Code. The
maximum spacing of fire hydrants along public water mains shall be
approximately 500 feet in single-family residential developments. Refer to
the Utilities Technical Design Guidelines for additional fire hydrant
requirements.



   (C)   Existing lines larger than eight inches in diameter are
considered part of the transmission system, and are not part of the water
distribution system. Developers may be required to construct distribution
mains of the required size in parallel to such existing transmission system
mains. Where existing distribution system mains within a development, or the
streets bounding a development, are smaller in size, or are otherwise
inadequate, the developer may be required to replace or parallel such mains
with those of the required size.



   (D)   Where no water main is existing along the frontage of a
single, existing, residential lot zoned for single-family use (R18-R35
through DR43-DR190), and the owner/developer of the single lot requests water
service, sufficient length of main shall be constructed by the
owner/developer to extend the new main from an existing water main to the
point of the requested service connection plus an additional 20 feet.
Additional easement along the entire property frontage may be requested to
allow for future extension of new water mains.



   (E)   The service connections installed by a developer's or owner's
contractor shall be guaranteed against any and all defects by the
owner/developer for a period of two years after acceptance of the
installations by the Utility Department.



   (F)   After acceptance by the town of the water mains and service
connections, the owner/developer or his agent may make application to the
Utility Department for the installation of one or more meters to be installed
on the new service connections to measure construction water used. The
developer will be held responsible for all water used from the date the meter
is set until there is a change of ownership.



(Ord. O2011-03, passed 2-7-11)



§ 52.109  CONSTRUCTION WATER THROUGH METERED SERVICE CONNECTIONS; RATES.



   The Utility Department will accept applications from a developer or his
authorized agent for the installation of a meter to measure water to be used
for construction provided that a service connection, including a curb stop
and meter box, has been installed and accepted for service by the town. The
Utility will prepare a separate billing for each metered service connection
used to supply water for construction.



(Ord. O2011-03, passed 2-7-11)



§ 52.110  EXTENSIONS: ENGINEERING COSTS; INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION.



   (A)   The costs for the preparation of construction plans for the
proposed water mains as well as the cost of staking the location of the water
mains, the cost of inspecting the construction, the cost of acquiring
rights-of-way and easements, and preparation of as-built plans, shall be part
of the construction cost assumed by the developer in accordance with plans
approved by the Utilities Manager. Review fees shall be paid as set by
resolution of the Town Council.



   (B)   The Utility Department will not perform field engineering or
submit detailed plans and specifications for the developer. This latter work
is to be performed by a civil engineer registered in the State of Arizona
employed by the developer. The final detailed plan and specification for the
"approach main" extension must be approved by the Utility Department and the
Utilities Manager before construction begins.

court or other similar developments covering more than one lot may be, upon
written permission granted by the Utilities Manager, supplied through a
single metered connection with the town main as long as single ownership
continues. Upon change from such single ownership, a new and separate
connection shall be immediately made for the building or premises having the
indirect connection.



   (B)   In case there is no water main on any street on which such
premises abut, and the customer first in order of service from the main
guarantees in writing the payment of water charges for all parcels of
property so served, the Manager may permit such connection to be installed or
remain until a water main is laid in such abutting street. When a water main
is laid in the abutting street, customers will be required to disconnect from
the main line and reconnect to the main in the abutting streets.  Customers
who fail to comply with the requirements of this section shall be subject to
shut off, upon 30 days' notice by the Utilities Manager.

   Charges for water utility service shall be made at monthly intervals
and shall, to the extent possible, be consistent with the policy for charging
for water in direct proportion to the cost of securing, developing and
delivering water to the customers of the town water system in the particular
service area. Water charges will be computed through the summation of the
monthly minimum, the monthly water use charge, and any special assessments,
taxes or surcharges that are or may be imposed by any governmental agency.
Water fees are adopted by the Town Council by resolution, and current fees
are on file in the office of the Town Clerk and in the Town Utility
Department.

      (2)   Service. The town will supply only such water at such
pressures as may be available from time to time as a result of normal
operations of its water system. The town does not guarantee a specific water
pressure or gallons-per-minute flow rate at any of the fire hydrants
installed. In the event service is interrupted or irregular or defective or
fails, the town will not be liable for any injuries or damages arising
therefrom. The customer shall make no claim against the town for any loss or
damage resulting from fire protection services provided. The town shall
furnish, install, own and maintain all public fire hydrants, subject to any
advance-in-aid-of-construction agreement or maintenance agreement that may be
required by the town. Water shall not be used from fire hydrants for any
purpose other than fire protection unless prior written consent is obtained
from the town, and charges will be made therefor at the estimated quantity
rates under the town's general service rate.

will be assessed if payment is not received within the 20 day period. The
town may terminate water service upon any delinquent account on providing the
customer written notice at least ten days prior to termination.



   (B)   In addition to the returned check charge list above, the town
may require the customer to make payments in cash, money order, certified
check, or other means acceptable to the town. Tendering a check covered by
insufficient funds does not relieve the customer of the obligation to make
timely payments on the original billing, nor prevent the town from otherwise
terminating service for non- payment.

to an intergovernmental agreement that provides that the capacity charges
collected be transferred to the town.



      (3)   Identification. The affected areas are the areas that
the town does and is legally and physically able to provide water and/or
wastewater services to.



      (4)   Change in service areas. By resolution, the town may

   (E)   Effect of payment of capacity charges on other applicable town
land use, zoning, platting, subdivision or development regulations.



      (1)   The payment of capacity charges will not entitle the
applicant to a building permit unless all other applicable land use, zoning,
planning, platting, subdivision or other related requirements, standards and
conditions have been met. Such other requirements, standards and conditions
are independent of the requirement for payment of a capacity charge.



      (2)   This chapter will not affect, in any manner, the

any type of special district established under state statutes, the town will
take into consideration any water and/or wastewater facilities provided by
the special district and capital costs paid by the special district for
necessary water and/or wastewater facilities and will not assess a portion of
the capacity charges otherwise calculated to be due that would duplicate the
infrastructure provided by the district or the costs imposed by the district
on new development.



(Ord. O2017-05, passed 5-1-17)



§ 53.05  PROCEDURES FOR IMPOSITION, CALCULATION AND COLLECTION.



   (A)   In general. An applicant will be notified by the town of the
applicable capacity charges required at the time of application for a
building permit or connection is requested. Capacity charges will be assessed
by the town at the time of application for a building permit or connect is
requested and will be paid by the applicant prior to the issuance of the
building permit or water and/or wastewater services are provided.



   (B)   Calculation.



      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a water service
agreement, the town will determine the fees based on the requested meters
size(s) and the number of meter(s) requested.



      (2)   (a)   Upon receipt of an application for a building
permit, the town will determine if it is for a change in use. In such cases,
the capacity charges due will be based only on the incremental difference in
meter size.



         (b)   If the meter size increases from the existing
meter to the new requested meter, the client will be assessed the difference
in capacity charges.



         (c)   If the meter size decreases from the existing
meter to the new requested meter, the town will not refund the difference in
fees assessed.



      (3)   (a)   After making these determinations (meter size
and number of meters), the town will assess the new development for water
and/or wastewater facilities a capacity charge incorporating any applicable
offset if set forth in the particular capacity charge calculation
methodology. The final decision of the Town Engineer may be appealed pursuant
to § 53.07 herein.



         (b)   An applicant may request a non-binding estimate of
capacity charges due for a particular new development at any time by filing a
request on a form provided for such purpose by the Engineering Department;
provided, however, that such estimate may be subject to change when a formal
application for a building permit for new development is made. Such
non-binding estimate is solely for the benefit of the prospective applicant
and shall in no way bind the town nor preclude it from making amendments or
revisions to any provisions of this chapter, the specific capacity charge
implementing ordinances or the capacity fee schedules.



      (4)   The calculation of capacity charges due from a
multiple-use new development shall be based upon the aggregated size and
number of water meters requested in the new development.



      (5)   The calculation of capacity charges due from a phased
new development will be based upon the size and number of water meters
requested within the phase of development for which a separate building
permit is requested.



      (6)   Capacity charges will be calculated based on the
capacity charge amount in effect at the time of application for a building
permit or connection request is made.



   (C)   Offsets.



      (1)   Offsets against the amount of capacity charges due from
a new development will be provided for, among other things, contributions
made or to be made in the future in cash, or by dedication of land or by
actual construction of all or part of a water or wastewater facility by the
affected property owner for public facilities meeting or exceeding the demand
generated by the new development and the contribution is determined by the
town to be a reasonable substitute for the cost of water or wastewater
facilities which are included in the particular capacity charge calculation
methodology.



      (2)   The amount of the excess contribution will be determined
by the town upon receipt of an application form requesting an offset;
provided, however, that:



         (a)   The town will make no reimbursement for excess
contributions unless it is part of a negotiated development agreement
accepted by a vote of the Mayor and Town Council.



         (b)   The excess contribution may not be transferred or
credited to any other type of charges or fees calculated to be due from that
development for other type of public facilities.



      (3)   No offset will be allowed unless the town has approved
the contribution or expenditure before it is made.



      (4)   Offsets for dedication of land or provision of water or
wastewater facilities will be applicable only as to capacity charges imposed
for the same types of facilities that are proposed to be dedicated or
provided. Even if the value of the dedication of land or provision of a
facility exceeds the capacity charges due for the type of water or wastewater
facility, the excess value may not be transferred to capacity charges
calculated to be due from the applicant for other types of public facilities
that capacity charges or development fees maybe imposed. Offsets may,
however, be transferred to the same applicant or to other applicants for new
development, which are proposed within the final approved platted area of the
same development and for the same type of public facility.



   (D)   Collection.  The town will collect all applicable capacity
charges at the time of issuance of a water service agreement or meter set
application and will issue a receipt to the applicant for such payment unless:



      (1)   The applicant is determined to be entitled to a full
offset; or



      (2)   The applicant has filed an appeal and a bond or other
surety in the amount of the capacity charges, as calculated by the town and
approved by the Town Attorney and Town Engineer, has been posted with the
town.

the structure will constitute a waiver of entitlement to a refund. No
interest shall be paid by the town in calculating the amount of the refunds.



      (5)   The town may, at its option, make refunds of capacity
charges by direct payment, by offsetting such refunds against other fees due

      (1)   Litter.  The Town Marshal or any other town officer
shall enforce the provisions of §§ 92.02(A) and 92.03 by prosecuting
violators of said sections in the Town Magistrate's Court pursuant to the
criminal provisions of this code.  If such prosecution fails to secure
compliance with the provisions of said sections, or in the event of inability
to prosecute violators by reason of failure to secure jurisdiction over their
persons, the Clerk shall compel the removal of litter by the procedures
outlined below.



(`87 Code, § 10-2-4)



      (2)   Graffiti.



         (a)   Removal required.  The town shall provide,
without charge, materials for the removal of graffiti to the owner or person
in control of any private premises upon which graffiti has been placed.  If
the person fails to remove or obliterate graffiti within 48 hours after the
town has provided the materials and has given the person written notice to
remove or obliterate the graffiti, the town may compel the removal or
obliteration of graffiti by the procedures set forth for the removal of
litter outlined below.



         (b)   Method of removal or obliteration.  For the
purposes of this division (2), TO REMOVE OR OBLITERATE GRAFFITI means to make
the graffiti indistinguishable as a message, code, depiction, or marking. 
If not removed, the obliteration of the graffiti shall be made with material
of a color which is similar to the material on which the graffiti has been
placed.



         (c)   Appeals.  The owner or person controlling such
premises may, prior to the date of compliance, appeal in writing to the Town
Council from the notice to remove or obliterate the graffiti. The Town
Council shall, at its next regular meeting after receiving the appeal, hear
and determine the same and the decision of the Town Council shall be final. 
The Town Council may either affirm or reverse the notice to remove or
obliterate the graffiti; or may modify the scope of work as required in the
notice.



   (B)   Notice to remove.  To compel the removal of litter through
the provisions of this chapter, if a person owning or controlling any
property fails, neglects, or refuses to remove or properly dispose of litter
located on property owned or controlled by such person, he or she shall be
given written notice by the Clerk to remove all litter or cut such weeds from
such property within 30 days from the date the notice was received by him or
her, and prior to the date of compliance on the notice.  Such notice shall
be received not less than 30 days before the date set thereon for compliance,
and shall contain the following:  an estimate of the cost of removal by the
town; a statement that unless the person owning or controlling such property
complies therewith within 30 days from the date such written notice is
received the town will, at the expense of the person owning or controlling
said property, perform the necessary work at a cost not to exceed the
estimate given in the notice; and a statement that such person may appeal in
writing to the Town Council within 30 days from the date the notice is
received by him or her and prior to the date of compliance.



(`87 Code, § 10-2-5)



   (C)   Service of notice.  Notice shall be personally served on the
owner or person controlling such property by the Town Manager or any other
town officer in the manner provided in A.R.C.P. 4(d), or mailed to the owner
or person controlling such property at his or her last known address by
certified or registered mail, or the address to which the tax bill for the
property was last mailed.  If the owner does not reside on such property, a
duplicate notice shall also be sent to him or her by certified or registered
mail at his or her last known address.



(`87 Code, § 10-2-6)



   (D)   Appeal to Town Council.  Prior to the date set for compliance
on the notice, the owner or person controlling such property may appeal in
writing to the Town Council from the demand of the Clerk.  The Town Council
shall, at its next regular meeting after receiving the appeal, hear and
determine the same and the decision of the Town Council shall be final.  The
Town Council may either affirm or reverse the decision of the Clerk or modify
the scope of the work as required in the notice.



(`87 Code, § 10-2-7)



   (E)   Removal by town.  When any such person to whom notice, as
aforesaid, has been given, and on or before the date of compliance on the
notice, or within such further time as may have been granted by the Town
Council on appeal, fails, neglects, or refuses to move from such property any
or all litter and weeds, the Clerk is authorized and directed to cause same
to be removed and disposed of at the expense of the owner or person
controlling such property.  Upon completion of the work, the Clerk shall
prepare a verified statement of account of the actual cost of such removal or
abatement, the date the work was completed, and the street address and the
legal description of the property on which said work was done, including 5%
for additional inspection and other incidental costs in connection therewith,
and shall serve a duplicate copy of such verified statement upon the person
owning or controlling such property in the manner prescribed in division (C)
above.  The owner or person controlling such property shall have 30 days
from the date of service upon him or her to appeal in writing to the Town
Council from the amount of the assessment as contained in the verified
statement.  If an appeal is not filed with the Clerk within such 30-day
period, then the amount of the assessment as determined by the Clerk shall
become final and binding.  If an appeal is taken, the Town Council shall, at
its next regular meeting, hear and determine the appeal and may affirm the
amount of the assessment, modify the amount thereof, or determine that no
assessment at all shall be made.  The decision of the Town Council shall be
final and binding on all persons.



(`87 Code, § 10-2-8)



   (F)   Lien for removal.  If no appeal is taken from the amount of
the assessment, or if an appeal is taken and the Town Council has affirmed or
modified the amount of the assessment, the original assessment or the
assessment as so modified shall be recorded in the office of the County
Recorder and, from the date of its recording, shall be a lien on said lot or
tract of land until paid.  Such liens shall be subject and inferior to the
lien for general taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages and encumbrances
of record. A sale of the property to satisfy a lien obtained under the
provisions of this section shall be made upon judgment of foreclosure or
order of sale.  The town shall have the right to bring an action to enforce
the lien in the superior court at any time after the recording of the
assessment, but failure to enforce the lien by such action shall not affect
its validity.  The recorded assessment shall be prima facie evidence of the
truth of all matters recited therein and of the regularity of all proceedings
prior to the recording thereof. A prior assessment for the purposes provided
in this section shall not be a bar to a subsequent assessment or assessments
for such purposes, and any number of liens on the same lot or tract of land
may be enforced in the same action.

§ 93.17  BOND.



   (A)   Each applicant must deposit with the town an amount in cash or
a performance bond of 100% of the amount of the cost of work proposed in the
application, as determined by the Town Engineer, as a guarantee that the work
will be completed in accordance with the permit and the town's adopted or
approved details and specifications.  If the application is solely for the
placement of a structure in the right-of-way which will require disturbance
of the roadway or other public facilities, the amount of the cash deposit or
bond shall be 100% of the estimated cost of restoration of the roadway or
public facility.



   (B)   The bond shall be joint and several in form and made payable
to the town.  The bond shall be signed by the applicant, or the property
owner if he or she is not the applicant, and a qualified surety company
authorized to transact business in the state.  The condition shall be that
the applicant will faithfully complete the work described in the application
in accordance with the plans, specifications, and conditions thereof.

subchapter.



   (E)   An applicant issued numerous small permits throughout the year
may post a continuing bond to cover work under more than one permit; however,
this continuing bond provision is not intended for use on new subdivision
work.  The continuing bond shall be of value sufficient to cover all work
under construction by the permittee at any time and shall be satisfactory to
the town.



   (F)   The bond is subject to cancellation as noted above, or may be
terminated after all obligations are fulfilled which were “permitted”
prior to the Town Engineer receiving cancellation notice from the surety. 
The surety shall not cancel, change, or amend any bond without ten-days prior
written notice having been served on the Town Engineer.

§ 93.18  INSURANCE.



   (A)   No applicant shall be entitled to a permit unless and until he
or she shall have filed and maintained on file with the town a certificate
certifying that he or she or his or her company or business firm carries
public liability and property damage insurance issued by an insurance carrier
authorized to do business in the state insuring the applicant and the town
and its agents against loss by reason of injuries to, or death of, persons,
or damages to property arising out of or related to work performed by the
applicant, its agents, or its employees while performing any work under such
permit.  Such insurance shall be primary and provide coverage for all
liability assumed by the applicant under this section, and shall be provided
by any permittee in the following minimum amounts:



      (1)   $500,000 for death of, or injury to, any one person in
any one accident;



      (2)   $1,000,000 for death of, or injuries to, more than one
person in any one accident;



      (3)   $500,000 for damages to property.



   (B)   Failure by the applicant to provide the town with such a
certificate, and failure by the town to demand the filing by the permittee of
such a certificate before such a permit is issued, shall not be deemed to
waive the permittee's obligation to provide the insurance specified herein. 
Such insurance certificate shall remain in effect and be kept on file with
the Town Engineer until all work to be performed by the permittee under the
permit has been completed.  Where an encroachment involves a permanent
obstruction, such insurance certificate requirements and other resolution
stipulations shall remain in effect until such construction is removed.  The
insurance certificate shall provide that coverage cannot be cancelled or
expire without providing 15-days written notice of such action to the town
also noting the permit number.



   (C)   This insurance requirement may be waived by the town if the
Town Engineer determines the financial resources of the applicant are
sufficient to indemnify the town pursuant to § 93.19.



   (D)   No evidence of liability insurance or surety bond shall be
required as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit to:



      (1)   A resident owner of a residential property where he or
she proposes to perform minor driveway construction in front of his or her
own property;

   The permittee shall be responsible for all liability imposed by law for
personal injury or property damage arising out of or related to work
performed by the permittee under the permit, or arising out of the failure on
the permittee's part to perform its work under the permit.  If any claim of
such liability is made against the town, its officers, agents, boards, or
employees, the permittee shall defend, indemnify, and hold them, and each of
them, harmless from such claim, including claims alleging the joint
negligence of the town, its officers and employees, and the permittee, except
to the extent actual negligence of the town has been established.

condition prior to granting a permit, or may charge a reasonable fee not to
exceed $500 in addition to the normal fee schedule for inspection and

restored to its original condition or to grant a permit in accordance with
this subchapter.

and that the event will not create a nuisance and will not otherwise threaten
the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the town and its visitors.
If there is a serious concern for public health, safety and/or welfare, the

poles. The signage permitted by the town under this division may be known as
signage permitted pursuant to the Street Banner Program. The town, through

Events Association to implement and operate the Street Banner Program,
including the collection of charges and fees for such signage. Fees and

expenditure in accordance with the terms of this subchapter.



      (3)   Identification. The affected area, including development
fee districts, if applicable, shall be described and/or mapped in the
particular public facility development fee ordinance.



      (4)   Change in boundaries of development fee districts. The
town may amend the boundaries of the development fee districts at such times
as may be deemed necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this
subchapter and applicable legal requirements for use of development fees. In
the event of annexation of unincorporated county land by the town, the Mayor
and Common Council shall consider whether such annexed area should be
included in a particular development fee district.



   (D)   Type of development affected. This subchapter shall apply to
all new development as herein defined and as defined in the development fee
ordinances for particular public facilities.



   (E)   Type of development not affected. This subchapter shall not
apply to:



      (1)   Previously-issued building permits. No development fee,
unless previously imposed, shall be imposed on new development for which a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this
subchapter.



      (2)   Previous payment of development fees. Subject to the
requirements of § 151.44, no development fees shall be due at a later stage
of the development permit or approval process if development fees have been
paid for such category of public facilities at an earlier stage in the
development permit or approval process.



      (3)   No net increase in dwelling units. No development fee
shall be imposed on any new residential development which does not add a new
dwelling unit.



      (4)   No net increase in non-residential square footage. No
development fee shall be imposed on any new non-residential development which
does not add square footage, unless the new non-residential development
increases the demand for public facilities for which development fees are
being imposed.



      (5)   Development projects which are the subject of a
development agreement containing provisions in conflict with this subchapter,
but only to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.



      (6)   Development by other governmental entities. Pursuant to
A.R.S. § 9-500.18, no development fee shall be imposed on new development by
the State of Arizona, school districts organized pursuant to Arizona state
laws, or the federal government, or agencies thereof; provided, however, that
the town may seek to negotiate the construction of public facilities or the
provision of services, or to negotiate the payment of development fees,
pursuant to a development agreement or intergovernmental agreement with such
public governmental entities.



   (F)   Effect of payment of development fees on other applicable town
land use, zoning, platting, subdivision or development regulations.



      (1)   The payment of development fees shall not entitle the
applicant to a building permit unless all other applicable land use, zoning,
planning, platting, subdivision or other related requirements, standards and
conditions have been met. Such other requirements, standards and conditions
are independent of the requirement for payment of a development fee.



      (2)   Neither this subchapter nor the specific development fee
ordinances for particular public facilities shall affect, in any manner, the
permissible use of property, density/intensity of development, design and
improvement standards or other applicable standards or requirements of the
town land development regulations, which shall be operative and remain in
full force and effect without limitation.



   (G)   Amendments. This subchapter, and any ordinance adopting
development fees for any particular public facility pursuant to this
subchapter, may be amended from time to time by the Mayor and Common Council;
provided, however, that no such amendment shall be adopted without a written
report detailing the reasons and need for the development fee revision nor
without proper notice and public hearing as set forth herein and in A.R.S. §
9-463.05C.



   (H)   Effect of imposition of development fees in a community
facilities district. In calculating and imposing a development fee applicable
to land in a community facilities district established under A.R.S. Title 48,
Chapter 4, Article 6, the town shall take into account all public
infrastructure provided by the district and capital costs paid by the
district for necessary public services and facilities and shall not assess a
portion of the development fee otherwise calculated to be due that would
duplicate the infrastructure provided by the district or the costs imposed by
the district on new development.



(Ord. O-2004-01, passed 1-20-04)



§ 151.44  PROCEDURES FOR IMPOSITION, CALCULATION AND COLLECTION.



   (A)   In general. An applicant shall be notified by the town of the
applicable development fee requirements at the time of application for a
building permit via the issuance of a development fee calculation form to the
applicant. Development fees shall be calculated by the town at the time of
application for a building permit and shall be paid by the applicant prior to
the issuance of a building permit.



   (B)   Calculation.



      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit,
the town shall determine (a) whether it is a residential or non-residential
use, (b) the specific category (type) of residential or non-residential
development, if applicable, (c) if residential, the number of new dwelling
units, (d) if nonresidential, the number of new or additional square feet of
gross floor area (rounded up to the nearest square foot) and the proposed
use, and (e) the development fee district in which the new development is
located (if applicable).



      (2)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit,
the town shall determine whether it is for a change in use. In such cases,
the development fee due shall be based only on the incremental increase in
the fee for the additional public facilities needed for the change in use.



      (3)   After making these determinations, the town shall
calculate the demand for the public facility added by the new development for
each public facility category for which a development fee is being imposed
and calculate the applicable development fee by multiplying the demand added
by the new development by the amount of the applicable development fee per
unit of development, incorporating any applicable offset if set forth in the
particular development fee calculation methodology.



      (4)   If the type of land use proposed for new development is
not expressly listed in the particular development fee ordinance and
schedule, the town shall:



         (a)   Identify the most similar land use type listed and
calculate the development fee based on the development fee for that land use;
or



         (b)   Identify the broader land use category within
which the specified land use would apply and calculate the development fee
based on the development fee for that land use category; or



         (c)   At the option of the applicant, or the Director of
Planning, determine the basis used to calculate the fee pursuant to an
independent impact analysis for development fee calculation. This option
shall be available only for transportation development fees and shall be
requested by the applicant on a form provided by the town for such purpose.
If this option is chosen, the following shall apply:



            1.   The applicant shall be responsible, at its
sole expense, for preparing the independent impact analysis, which shall be
reviewed for approval by the Director of Planning, and, if appropriate, the
Town Engineer or other town staff or officials, prior to payment of the fee.



            2.   The independent impact analysis shall measure
the impact that the proposed development will have on the particular public
facility at issue, and shall be based on the same methodologies used in the
development fee calculation methodology report, and shall be supported by
professionally acceptable data and assumptions.



            3.   After review of the independent impact
analysis submitted by the applicant, the Director of Planning shall accept or
reject the analysis and provide written notice to the applicant of its
decision on a form provided for such purpose within 30 days. If the
independent impact analysis is rejected, the written notice shall provide an
explanation of the insufficiencies of the analysis.



            4.   The final decision of the Director of
Planning may be appealed pursuant to § 151.46 herein.



      (5)   An applicant may request a non-binding estimate of
development fees due for a particular new development at any time by filing a
request on a form provided for such purpose by the Planning Department;
provided, however, that such estimate may be subject to change when a formal
application for a building permit for new development is made. Such
nonbinding estimate is solely for the benefit of the prospective applicant
and shall in no way bind the town nor preclude it from making amendments or
revisions to any provisions of this subchapter, the specific development fee
implementing ordinances or the development fee schedules.



      (6)   The calculation of development fees due from a
multiple-use new development shall be based upon the aggregated demand for
each public facility generated by each land use type in the new development.



      (7)   The calculation of development fees due from a phased
new development shall be based upon the demand generated by each specific
land use within the phase of development for which a separate building permit
is requested.



      (8)   Development fees shall be calculated based on the
development fee amount in effect at the time of application for a building
permit.



   (C)   Offsets.



      (1)   Offsets against the amount of a development fee due from
a new development shall be provided for, among other things, contributions
made or to be made in the future in cash, or by dedication of land or by
actual construction of all or part of a public facility by the affected
property owner for public facilities meeting or exceeding the demand
generated by the new development and the contribution is determined by the
town to be a reasonable substitute for the cost of public facilities which
are included in the particular development fee calculation methodology.



      (2)   The amount of the excess contribution shall be
determined by the town upon receipt of an application form requesting an
offset; provided, however, that:



         (a)   The town will make no reimbursement for excess
contributions unless and until the particular public facility fund has
sufficient revenue to make the reimbursement without jeopardizing the
continuity of the town's capital improvements program,  and



         (b)   The excess contribution may not be transferred or
credited to any other type of development fees calculated to be due from that
development for other type of public facilities. The determination of the
eligibility for and the amount of the credit shall be made by the town on a
form provided for such purposes. If the applicant contends that any aspect of
the town's decision constitutes an abuse of discretion, the applicant shall
be entitled to appeal pursuant to § 151.46.



      (3)   No offset shall be allowed unless the town has approved
the contribution or expenditure before it is made.



      (4)   Offsets for dedication of land or provision of public
facilities shall be applicable only as to development fees imposed for the
same types of public facilities, which are proposed to be dedicated or
provided. Even if the value of the dedication of land or provision of a
public facility exceeds the development fee due for the type of public
facility, the excess value may not be transferred to development fees
calculated to be due from the applicant for other types of public facilities
for which development fees may be imposed. Offsets may, however, be
transferred to the same applicant or to other applicants for new development,
which are proposed within the final approved platted area of the same
development and for the same type of public facility.



   (D)   Collection.



      (1)   The town shall collect all applicable development fees
at the time of issuance of a building permit and shall issue a receipt to the
applicant for such payment unless:



         (a)   The applicant is determined to be entitled to a
full offset; or



         (b)   The applicant has been determined to be not
subject to the payment of a development fee; or



         (c)   The applicant has filed an appeal and a bond or
other surety in the amount of the development fee, as calculated by the town
and approved by the Town Attorney and Town Engineer, has been posted with the
town.



      (2)   The town shall collect a development fee at the time of
issuance of a building permit even if development fees were paid by the
applicant at an earlier time in the development permit or approval process if
the amount of the development fees have increased since such prior approval.
Except as provided for in § 151.43(F), the applicant shall only be liable
for the difference between the development fees paid earlier and those in
effect at the time of issuance of the subsequent building permit.



(Ord. O-2004-01, passed 1-20-04)



§ 151.45  ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT FEE ACCOUNTS; APPROPRIATION OF
DEVELOPMENT FEE FUNDS; REFUNDS.



   (A)   Development fee accounts. A development fee account shall be
established by the town for each category of public facilities for which
development fees are imposed. Such account shall clearly identify the
category, account, or fund for which the development fee has been imposed.
Sub accounts may be established for individual development fee districts. All
development fees collected by the town shall be deposited into the
appropriate development fee account or sub account, which shall be interest
bearing. All interest earned on monies deposited to such account shall be
credited to and shall be considered funds of the account. The funds of each
such account shall be capable of being accounted for separately from all
other town funds, over time. The town shall establish and implement necessary
accounting controls to ensure that the development fee funds are properly
deposited, accounted for and appropriated in accordance with this subchapter,
A.R.S. § 9-463.05 and any other applicable legal requirements.



   (B)   Appropriation of development fee funds.



      (1)   In general. Development fee funds may be appropriated
for public facilities, for public facility expenditures as defined in §
151.42, hereof and for the payment of principal, interest and other financing
costs on contracts, bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf
of the town or other applicable local governmental entities to finance such
public facilities and public facility expenditures. All appropriations from
development fee accounts shall be detailed on a form provided for such
purposes and filed within the Finance Department.



      (2)   Restrictions on appropriations. Development fees shall
be appropriated only:



         (a)   For the particular public facility for which they
were imposed, calculated and collected;



         (b)   Within the development fee district where
collected unless the development fee funds will be appropriated for a public
facility necessitated by or serving the new development as provided herein;
and



         (c)   Within ten years of the beginning of the fiscal
year immediately succeeding the date of collection, unless such time period
is extended as provided herein. Development fees shall not be appropriated
for funding maintenance or repair of public facilities nor for operational or
personnel expenses associated with the provision of the public facility.



      (3)   Appropriation of development fee funds outside of
district where collected. Development fee funds may be appropriated for a
public facility located outside of the district where collected only if the
demand for the public facility is generated in whole or in part by the new
development or if the public facility will actually serve the new development.



      (4)   Appropriation of development fee funds beyond ten years
of collection. Notwithstanding division (B)(2) of this section, development
fee funds may be appropriated beyond ten years from the beginning of the
fiscal year immediately succeeding the date of collection if the
appropriation is for a public facility which requires more than ten years to
plan, design and construct, and the demand for the public facility is
generated in whole or in part by the new development, or if the public
facility will actually serve the new development. Such appropriations shall
be documented by the town.



   (C)   Procedure for appropriation of development fee funds.



      (1)   The town shall each year identify public facility
projects anticipated to be funded in whole or in part with development fees.
The public facility recommendations shall be based upon the development fee
annual review set forth in division (B)(3) of this section and such other
information as may be relevant, and may be part of the town' s annual budget
and capital improvements programming process.



      (2)   The recommendations shall be consistent with the
provisions of this subchapter, the particular public facility development fee
ordinances, A.R.S. § 9-463.05, or other applicable legal requirements and
any guidelines adopted by the Mayor and Common Council.



      (3)   The Mayor and Common Council may include development
fee-funded public facilities in the town's annual budget and capital
improvements program. If included, the description of the public facility
shall specify the nature of the facility, the location of the public
facility, the capacity to be added by the public facility the service area of
the public facility, the need/demand for the public facility and the
anticipated timing of completion of the public facility.



      (4)   The Mayor and Common Council may authorize development
fee-funded public facilities at such other times as may be deemed necessary
and appropriate by a majority vote of the Common Council.



      (5)   The Mayor and Common Council shall verify that adequate
development fee funds are or will be available from the appropriate
development fee account for the particular public facility.



   (D)   Refunds.



      (1)   Eligibility for refund.



         (a)   Expiration or revocation of building permit. An
applicant who has paid a development fee for a new development for which the
necessary building permit has expired or for which the building permit has
been revoked prior to construction shall be eligible to apply for a refund of
development fees paid on a form provided by the town for such purposes.



         (b)   Failure of town to appropriate development fee
funds within time limit. The current property owner may apply for a refund of
development fees paid by an applicant if the town has failed to appropriate
the development fees collected from the applicant within the time limit
established in divisions (B)(2) and (4) of this section. The refund
application shall be made on a form provided by the town for such purposes.



         (c)   Abandonment of development  after initiation of
construction. An applicant who has paid a development fee for a new
development for which a building permit has been issued and pursuant to which
construction has been initiated, but which construction is abandoned prior to
completion and issuance of a certificate of occupancy, shall not be eligible
for a refund unless the uncompleted building is completely demolished.



         (d)   A 5% administrative fee, but not to exceed $200,
shall be deducted from the amount of any refund granted and shall be retained
by the town in the appropriate development fee account to defray the
administrative expenses associated with the processing of a refund
application.



      (2)   Except as provided in divisions (D)(1)(a) and (c) and
(D)(6) of this section, refunds shall be made only to the current owner of
property on which the new development was proposed or occurred.



      (3)   Processing of applications for a refund. Applications
for a refund shall be made on a form provided by the town for such purposes
and shall include all information required in divisions (D)(5) or (6) of this
section, as appropriate. Upon receipt of a complete application for a refund,
the town shall review the application and documentary evidence submitted by
the applicant as well as such other information and evidence as may be deemed
relevant, and make a determination as to whether a refund is due. Refunds by
direct payment shall be made following an affirmative determination by the
town.



      (4)   Applications for refunds due to abandonment of a new
development prior to completion shall be made on forms provided by the town
and shall be made within 60 days following expiration or revocation of the
building permit. The applicant shall submit (a) evidence that the applicant
is the property owner or the duly designated agent of the property owner, (b)
the amount of the development fees paid by public facilities category and
receipts evidencing such payments, and (c) documentation evidencing the
expiration or revocation of the building permit or proof of demolition of the
structure pursuant to a valid town-issued demolition permit. Failure to apply
for a refund within 60 days following expiration or revocation of the
building permit or demolition of the structure shall constitute a waiver of
entitlement to a refund. No interest shall be paid by the town in calculating
the amount of the refunds.



      (5)   Applications for refunds due to the failure of the town
to appropriate development fees collected from the applicant within the time
limits established in division (B)(2) of this section shall be made on forms
provided by the town and shall be made within one year following the
expiration of such time limit. The applicant shall submit (a) evidence that
the applicant is the property owner or the duly designated agent of the
property owner, (b) the amount of the development fees paid by public
facility category and receipts evidencing such payments, and (c) description
and documentation of the town' s failure to appropriate development fee funds
for relevant public facilities.



      (6)   The town may, at its option, make refunds of development
fees by direct payment, by offsetting such refunds against other development
fees due for the same category of public facilities for new development on
the same property, or by other means subject to agreement with the property
owner.

§ 151.46  APPEALS.



   (A)   An appeal from any decision of a town official pursuant to
this subchapter shall be made to the Mayor and Common Council by filing a
written appeal pursuant to the appropriate town form with the Town Clerk
within 30 days following the decision which is being appealed; provided,
however, that if the notice of appeal is accompanied by a cash bond or letter
of credit in a form satisfactory to the Town Attorney and the Town Engineer
in an amount equal to the development fee calculated to be due, a building
permit may be issued to the new development. The filing of an appeal shall
not stay the imposition or the collection of the development fee as
calculated by the town unless a cash bond or other sufficient surety has been
provided.



   (B)   The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate
that the decision of the town is erroneous.



   (C)   All appeals shall detail the specific grounds therefor and all
other relevant information and shall be filed on a form provided by the town
for such purposes.

§ 151.47  EXEMPTIONS; WAIVERS.



   (A)   Filing of application. Petitions for exemptions to the
application of the provisions of this subchapter or waivers from specific
development fees shall be filed with the Mayor and Common Council on forms
provided by the town.



   (B)   Effect of grant of exemption/waiver. If the Mayor and Common
Council grants an exemption or waiver in whole or in part of development fees
otherwise due, the amount of the development fees exempted or waived shall be
provided by the town from non-development fee funds, as may be provided in
the particular development fee ordinances establishing development fees for
particular public facilities, and such funds shall be deposited to the
appropriate development fee account within a reasonable period of time
consistent with the applicable town capital improvements program.



   (C)   Development agreements. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
limit the town's authority or ability to enter into development agreements
pursuant to A.R.S. 9-500.05 with applicants for new development who may
provide for dedication of land, payments in lieu of development fees, or
actual infrastructure improvements. Such development agreements may allow
offsets against development fees for contributions made or to be made in the
future in cash, or by taxes or assessments or dedication of land or by actual
construction of all or part of a public facility by the affected property
owner.

or divided from another parcel of land consisting of two and one-half acres
or less until first having applied for and been granted the approval of the
split or division by the Town Council.  The Town Council shall determine
before granting such approval that:



      (1)   The split or division will not interfere with the

§ 155.01  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.



   (A)   In many communities in which medical marijuana "dispensaries"
have been established, law enforcement agencies have documented the serious
and adverse impacts associated with such dispensaries.  These communities
and the media have reported increased crime, including burglaries, robberies,
violence, illegal sales of marijuana to and use of marijuana by minors and
others without medical need in the areas immediately surrounding such medical
marijuana dispensaries.  Other negative secondary effects include the
smoking of marijuana in public areas and adverse impacts on neighboring
businesses (including odor complaints).  The town could reasonably
anticipate experiencing similar adverse impacts and effects from any
marijuana dispensaries and cultivation and other marijuana operations
established in the town.



   (B)   Additionally, a number of sources, including the United States
Department of Justice's California Medical Marijuana website [which contains
various documents and reports related to issues surrounding marijuana use]
and the "White Paper on Marijuana Dispensaries" published by the California
Police Chiefs Association's Task Force on Marijuana Dispensaries (April 22,
2009), have concluded that the establishment of marijuana dispensaries can
lead to an increase in crime.  Among the crimes cited as typical examples
are burglaries, robberies, sales of illegal drugs in areas immediately
surrounding such dispensaries, as well as other public nuisances such as
loitering, smoking marijuana in public places, sales to minors and driving
while under the influence of marijuana.  The Town Council finds that these
data and conclusions, experiences in other cities, towns and counties justify
the implementation of the regulatory zoning and safety measures included in
this chapter.



   (C)   The provisions of this chapter are intended to acknowledge and
protect the rights of qualifying patients and their designated caregivers
under the provisions of Title 36, A.R.S. §§ 36-2801 et seq., while also
protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the public; through
implementation of the Zoning Code; and curtailing to the extent reasonably
possible, the possession, use, distribution, or cultivation of marijuana for
unlawful purposes by:



      (1)   Requiring that medical marijuana businesses, operations
and facilities be operated in a manner that minimizes potential health and
safety risks and mitigates the negative impacts that a medical marijuana
dispensary or cultivation operation might have on surrounding properties and
persons;



      (2)   Regulating the conduct of persons owning, operating and
using medical marijuana dispensaries and cultivation facilities in order to
protect the public health, safety and welfare; and



      (3)   Regulating the location and operation of medical
marijuana dispensaries, cultivation facilities and medical marijuana
operations.



   (D)   By adoption of this chapter, the Town Council does not intend
to authorize or make legal any act that is not permitted under federal or
state law.

consent  of the property owners of both the sending property and the
receiving property.



   (B)   Agreement. The sending property owner and the receiving
property owner shall execute an agreement ("TDR Agreement") approved by the

maintain records for each receiving property transfer of development rights
on a square foot basis and deduct each transfer from the total square footage
of the sending property, until such time the total square footage of the
sending property is exhausted in terms of available square footage.



   (G)   Right to purchase. The town shall have a right of first

CHAPTER 10 - WASHES 
SECTION 10.0 GENERAL: 
A. 	The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish standards for development in or near Major and Minor Washes as defined in Appendix A – Glossary of Terms and Definitions which will conserve land in its natural state, protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents, and prevent unnecessary alteration of the natural environment.   
B. 	The desert terrain within the Town of Cave Creek contains significant drainage ways. Special regulations are necessary in order to protect these natural features and are based on the intensity of land disturbance, density, and including but not limited to, the natural characteristics of high desert terrain, such as: steepness of slope, significant vegetation, landforms, soil and rock stability, and existing drainage patterns. These regulations are intended to allow for responsible development in wash areas while minimizing the physical and visual impact of such development. 
C. 	If there is a conflict between the provisions of this Ordinance and other Federal, State of Arizona, Maricopa County, other adopted Town Codes or Ordinances, the more restrictive shall apply. 
SECTION 10.1 DESIGN STANDARDS: 
A. 	The minimum Grading & Drainage design standards as contained in the Town of Cave Creek Technical Design Guideline Number 1 – Grading & Drainage and this Ordinance shall apply to all construction projects located within the Town.

SECTION 1.3 SUBDIVISION DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES:  
A. 	Overview: 
1. 	The Town considers subdivision design to be an integral part in the implementation of the goal and objectives as adopted in the Town’s General Plan. 
Required subdivision design standards protect and provide for the following:  
a. 	
Respect for the carrying capacity of the land. 

b. 	
Working in concert with the natural topography of the site.  

c. 	
Preservation of environmental resources such as wildlife habitats & corridors. 

d. 	
Conservation of native vegetation and water resources. 

e. 	
Protection of natural water courses. 

f. 	
Establishment of public rights-of-way and utility easements. 

g. 	
Development of public services infrastructure.  


Town of Cave Creek Subdivision Ordinance 1-18-2011 Principles and Policies Page 5 of 6 

Subdivision Ordinance 	Chapter 1 

h. 	
Creation of equestrian, pedestrian & non-motorized vehicular trails.  

i. 	
Preservation of scenic vistas. 


2. 	The operating principle upon which land areas are subdivided is maintaining compatibility between the Town’s natural and built environments.  Just as architectural creativity is encouraged for the design of structures, so is site engineering sensitivity expected for open space preservation as well as the placement of all man-made improvements. 
B. 	General Subdivision Requirements: 
1. 	Accommodation of Natural Conditions: Land planning and individual lot designations within each subdivided tract shall be responsive to existing natural conditions and community character themes.  The subdivision design approach shall vary according to development type, required improvements, design themes or amenities and preferred site arrangements. 
a. 	
Applicability to Land Development Types: Subdivisions of tracts designated by the Zoning Map for non-residential use or Multiple Residence (MR) use shall have indicated on the plat the permitted development envelope for each lot as determined by the applicable zoning district requirements.  The Town requires development envelope designation on individual lots in tracts designated Single Residence (R), or Desert Rural (DR), where necessary to preserve natural water courses, significant stands of vegetation, wildlife habitats or to prevent scarring of terrain or detrimental impacts on established dwellings. 

b. 	
Required Improvement Waivers: The Council, at its discretion and in consideration of the subdivider’s provision of trail corridors and connections, designation of preserved natural areas, dedication of scenic easements, maintenance of natural drainage or other responses to community character, may waive specific required improvements such as sidewalks and street lighting to better adapt the proposed improvements to the site and its environmental context. 


2. 	Dedication of parks and other public lands: Any portion of the tract which contains lands designated in the general plan for parks, schools, trail corridors or other public purposes shall either be dedicated to the public, reserved for acquisition by the public within a specified time period or set into the appropriate easement which guarantees public access to such areas in perpetuity.
