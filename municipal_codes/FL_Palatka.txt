PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City 
of Palatka, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through 
April 10, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section 
is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note 
indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use 
of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 
1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and 
Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully 
given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance 
throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Allen R. Bush, City Manager, Ms. Jane R. Buck, former City 
Clerk, Ms. Betsy Jordan Driggers, City Clerk, Mr. Carl Honig, Planning Director, and Mr. Edward E. 
Hedstrom, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this 
publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances 
which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool 
in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have 
been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent 
nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general 
and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted." 
    In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be 
able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

PART I - CHARTER AND RELATED LAWS[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Part I is a compilation of the city's charter laws and other related special acts. Subpart A 
contains the city's charter laws, while subpart B contains related laws. The laws contained in this part 
have been arranged in the most logical order possible by the editor and catchlines have been added to

ch. 9875(1923). 
The compilation was based on a 1956 compilation which was supplemented through Laws of Fla., ch. 67-
1855. A great deal of the material found in that earlier compilation has been omitted as being superseded 
by general state law or by the home rule act (F.S. ch. 166). Amendments to the Charter are indicated by 
parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates the 
provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected 
without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state 
statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Editor's note The "original boundaries" embodied in this section are as established by Laws 
of Fla., ch. 9875(1923); tracts 24 were added by Laws of Fla., ch. 61-2626; tract 5 was added 
by Laws of Fla., ch. 63-1734; tract 6 was added by Laws of Fla., ch. 65-2046; tract 7 was added 
by Laws of Fla., ch. 67-1851; tracts 816 were added by Laws of Fla., ch. 73-578. This act 
embodies the annexations made by ordinances through Ord. No. 73-5, passed March 22, 1973. 
Tract 17 was added by Laws of Fla., ch. 76-454; although such act purports to amend Laws of 
Fla., ch. 9875(1923), § 3, clearly this is not what it was intended to do, for it excludes from the 
description of the corporate boundaries annexations made by ordinances between March 22, 
1973, and August 1976. 
Section 1 of Res. No. 5-12, adopted May 11, 1989, provided as follows:

Florida, in that the said Kenneth M. Quigley and Helen Quigley, his wife, did not petition the 
City for annexation and that their property was erroneously included in the voluntary petition for 
annexation filed by College Housing, Ltd. and Joseph F. Chapman, III, and Jeanette Chapman."

commission, or its authorized representatives, and the removed member may present charges 
and defenses. 
(e) ?Decision of board final; nonreviewable; notice to city manager and removed member. The three

20 consecutive years, the amount of the pension will be the greater of: (1) 50 percent of final 
average compensation; or (2) the pension amount calculated in subsection (b) of this section.

Sec. 2-173. - Forms of payment of pension. 
    A member of the retirement plan may elect to have pension payments made under any one of the 
following forms of payment and name a survivor beneficiary. The election and naming of the survivor 
beneficiary shall be made on a form furnished by and filed with the retirement plan prior to the date the 
first pension payment is made. An election of form of payment may not be changed on or after the date 
the first pension payment is made. A named survivor beneficiary may not be changed on or after the date 
the first pension payment is made if form of payment A or B is elected. A named survivor beneficiary may 
be more than one person only if form of payment SL or form of payment C is elected. A named survivor 
beneficiary shall have an insurable interest in the life of the member or vested former member at the time 
of naming. Payment shall be made under form of payment SL if there is not a timely election of another 
form of payment. The amount of pension under forms of payment A, B and C shall have the same 
actuarial present value, computed as of the effective date of the pension, as the amount of pension under 
form of payment SL. 
(1) ?Form of payment SLStraight life pension. The retired member is paid a pension for life under 
form of payment SL. All payments stop upon the death of the retired member. The amount of 
pension shall be determined in accordance with section 2-170. 
(2) ?Form of payment ALife payments with full continuation to survivor beneficiary. The retired 
member is paid a reduced pension for life under form of payment A. Upon the death of the 
retired member during the lifetime of the named survivor beneficiary, the named survivor 
beneficiary is paid the full amount of reduced pension until death. 
(3) ?Form of payment BLife payments with one-half continuation to survivor beneficiary. The 
retired member is paid a reduced pension for life under form of payment B. Upon the death of 
the retired member during the lifetime of the named survivor beneficiary, the named survivor 
beneficiary is paid one-half the amount of reduced pension benefits until death. 
(4) ?Form of payment CLife payments with period certain guarantee. The retired member is paid 
a reduced pension for life under form of payment C. Upon the death of the retired member 
during the guaranteed period, the named survivor beneficiary is paid the full amount of the 
reduced pension for the remainder of the guaranteed period. The guaranteed period shall be 
selected by the member or vested former member at the time of election of payment C. The 
guaranteed period shall be either 60 months or 120 months. The actuarial present value of the 
remaining guaranteed payments shall be paid to the legal representative of the retired member 
or the named survivor beneficiary, whoever survives the longer, if both the retired member and 
the named survivor beneficiary die during the guaranteed periods.

Sec. 2-174. - Disability retirement generally. 
(a) ?Conditions; eligibility. The board of trustees may retire a member of the retirement plan who 
becomes incapacitated for continued employment by the city if each of the following conditions is

(1) ?Application for disability retirement is filed with the retirement plan by either the member or the 
city within one year of the date the member ceases to be paid by the city; 
(2) ?The member has ten or more years of credited service; 
(3) ?The member undergoes all medical examinations and tests ordered by the retirement plan, and 
releases to the retirement plan all medical reports and records requested by the retirement plan; 
and 
(4) ?The medical advisor selected by the board of trustees reports that: 
a. ?The member is mentally or physically incapacitated for any continued employment by the 
city; 
b. ?The incapacity is likely to continue for at least one year (to be permanent); and 
c. ?The member should be retired. 
The effective date of a disability retirement shall not predate (i) the date of disability, or (ii) the date the 
member ceases to be paid by the city. 
(b) ?Amount of pension; form of payment. The amount of a disability pension shall be computed 
according to section 2-170 and shall not be less than 25 percent of the final average compensation. 
The disability retired member shall have the right to elect a form of payment provided in section 2-
173. 
(c) ?Disability incurred in performance of duty. The following exceptions to the provisions of subsections 
(a) and (b) of this section shall apply if the board of trustees finds that the member's disability is the 
direct result of the member's performance of duty as an employee of the city and the member is paid 
worker's compensation periodic benefits other than for medical expenses: 
(1) ?The requirement of ten years of credited service shall be waived. 
(2) ?The amount of pension shall not be less than 45 percent of the final average compensation. 
(Code 1981, § 2-86) 


Sec. 2-175. - Limitation on amount of disability pension.

disability pension and the date the disability retired member attains the age of 65 years. Application 
of the limitation shall be to the amount of pension under form of payment SL. The effect of an 
election of any other form of payment shall be taken into account after application of the provisions of 
this section. 
(b) ?When a retired member is receiving a disability pension, social security, and/or worker's 
compensation benefits, and the total monthly benefits received from these exceed 100 percent of the 
member's final average compensation, the disability pension shall be reduced so that the total 
monthly pension received by the retired member does not exceed 100 percent of such final average 
compensation. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to 
an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 
83.9692. 
(c) ?The retirement plan shall compute the initial amount of pension on the presumption the retired 
member is receiving social security disability benefits and worker's compensation periodic benefits. 
The presumed amounts shall be estimated by the retirement plan using the retired member's final 
average compensation and the single person statutory benefits. The retired member may, at any 
time, submit evidence of receipt of a lesser amount of social security or worker's compensation 
benefits. The retirement plan shall adjust the amount of pension to reflect actual social security and 
worker's compensation benefits if it finds the submitted evidence substantiates the disability retired 
member's claim. 
(d) ?The disability retired member may submit an affidavit declaring that an application for social security 
or worker's compensation benefits will not be made, thereby voiding application of the presumption 
of receipt. The affidavit shall also contain the promise to immediately notify the retirement plan 
should an application be made for social security or worker's compensation benefits. 
(e) ?The retirement plan shall periodically request substantiated income information from disability 
retired members subject to this section. Failure to provide the requested information within 90 days

of the pension may be suspended by the board of trustees. If the refusal continues for one year, the 
board of trustees may revoke the disability retired member's rights in and to the disability pension. A 
disability pension shall be terminated if the medical advisor selected by the board of trustees reports 
that the disability retired member is no longer mentally or physically incapacitated for any continued 
employment by the city and the board of trustees concurs with the report. 
(b) ?The membership status of a terminated disability retired member who is returned to city employment 
shall be governed by the provisions of section 2-163. Actual credited service at time of disability 
retirement shall be restored upon again acquiring membership within five years of the date the 
disability pension was terminated. Credited service shall be granted for the period of disability 
retirement if the disability retired member was paid worker's compensation periodic benefits on 
account of the disability for which retired. 
(c) ?A terminated disability retired member who does not reacquire membership and restoration of 
credited service, as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall have actual credited service at

Sec. 2-202. - Internal Revenue Code qualification. 
    The city intends the retirement plan to be a qualified pension plan under section 401 of the Internal 
Revenue Code, as amended, or successor provisions of law, and that the trust be an exempt organization 
under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code. The board of trustees may adopt such additional 
provisions for the retirement plan as are necessary to fulfill this intent. 
(Code 1981, § 2-114) 


Sec. 2-203. - Purpose of investment policy statement. 
(a) ?The pension board trustees maintain that an important determinant of future investment returns is 
the expression and periodic review of the fund's investment objectives. To that end, the trustees 
have adopted this statement of investment policy. 
(b) ?In fulfilling their fiduciary responsibility, the trustees recognizes that the retirement system is an 
essential vehicle for providing income benefits to retired participants or their beneficiaries. The board 
also recognizes that the obligations of the fund are long-term and that investment policy should be 
made with a view toward performance and return over a number of years. The general investment 
objective, then, is to obtain a reasonable total rate of returndefined as interest and dividend 
income plus realized and unrealized capital gains or lossesthat is greater than the actuarial

with the following fiduciary standard: 
    A fiduciary shall discharge its duties with respect to the plan solely in the interest of the participants 
and beneficiaries and 
(1) ?For the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and 
defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan; 
(2) ?With the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstance then prevailing that a 
prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of 
an enterprise of like character and with like aim; 
(3) ?By diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large loss, unless under 
the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so. 
(d) ?Reasonable consistency of return and protection of assets against the inroads of inflation are 
paramount. However, the volatility of interest rates and securities markets make it necessary to 
judge results within the context of several years rather than over short periods of one or two years or 
less. The board's acknowledges that each manager is only responsible for the assets that are placed 
under its management and not for the investment policies that apply to the fund's entire portfolio.

(1) ?Any member who is eligible to receive a normal retirement pension may participate in the 
DROP. Members shall elect to participate by applying to the board of trustees on a form 
provided for that purpose. 
(2) ?A member cannot participate in the DROP any longer than five years. 
(3) ?Upon a member's election to participate in the DROP, he or she shall cease to be a member 
and is precluded from accruing any additional benefit under the pension fund. For all fund 
purposes, the member becomes a retiree. The amount of credited service and final average 
salary freeze as of the date of entry into the DROP. 
(b) ?Amounts payable upon election to participate in DROP: 
(1) ?Monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had the member terminated 
employment with the department and elected to receive monthly pension payments will be paid 
into the DROP and credited to the retiree. Payments into the DROP will be made monthly over 
the period the retiree participates in the DROP, up to a maximum of 60 months. 
(2) ?Payments to the DROP earn interest using the rate of investment return earned on pension 
fund assets during the 12-month period ended September 30. Prior to October 1, 2007, the rate 
determined shall be the rate as reported by the fund's investment monitor. Beginning October 1, 
2007, the rate shall be the rate as reported by the fund's investment monitor; however, no 
member shall earn less than an annual rate of zero percent (0%). Beginning October 1, 2008, a 
member's DROP account under this subsection shall be debited or credited after each fiscal 
year, ending September 30th, with either: 
a. ?Interest at an effective rate of six and one-half (6½) percent per annum compounded 
monthly on the prior month's ending balance; or 
b. ?Earnings, determined as follows: The average daily balance in a member's DROP account 
shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the actual net rate of investment return 
realized for the 12-month period ended September 30th. "Net investment return," for the 
purpose of this paragraph, is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP 
account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and 
management fees. The rate determined shall be the rate as determined by the fund's 
investment monitor. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive either earnings 
or interest on his account to be determined as provided above. The member may, in 
writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to 
change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the 
following quarter. A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with 
earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A 
member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of 
participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter 
immediately preceding termination of participation plus any monthly periodic additions 
made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter and prior to 
distribution. However, if a plan member does not terminate employment at the end of 
participation in the DROP, interest credits shall cease on the current balance and on all 
future DROP deposits. 
(3) ?No payments will be made from DROP until the member terminates employment with the city. 
(4) ?Upon termination of employment, participants in the DROP will receive the balance of the 
DROP account in accordance with the following rules: 
a. ?Members may elect to begin to receive payment upon termination of employment or defer 
payment of DROP until the latest day as provided under sub-subparagraph c. 
b. ?Payments shall be made in either: 
1. ?Lump sum. Any part or the entire account balance will be paid to the retiree upon 
approval of the board of trustees. 
2. ?Installments. The account balance will be paid out to the retiree in three equal 
payments paid over three years, the first payment to be made upon approval of the 
board of trustees. 
3. ?Monthly installment. The account balance shall be paid out in monthly installments 
over the lifetime of the member or until the entire balance is exhausted, whichever 
comes first. Monthly amount paid shall be determined by the fund's actuary in 
accordance with selections made by the member on a form provided by the board of 
trustees. 
(i) ?DROP participants who choose to withdraw in monthly installments may elect 
once each year to withdraw an additional lump sum. 
(ii) ?Should there be less than 12 months of monthly payments remaining after any 
lump sum withdrawal or monthly installment, then the remaining balance shall be 
distributed to the DROP participant in a lump sum within 60 days. 
c. ?Any form of payment selected by a plan member must comply with the minimum 
distribution requirements of the IRC 401(A)(9). 
d. ?Beneficiary. 
1. ?The surviving spouse beneficiary of the DROP participant who dies shall have the 
same right as the participant in accordance with this section. If distributions have not 
yet begun, they do not need to begin until the date the deceased DROP participant 
would have attained age 70½. 
2. ?Nonspouse beneficiary. If distributions to the DROP participant have begun before his 
or her death, the remaining balance shall be distributed to the nonspouse beneficiary 
under the distribution method selected by the DROP participant prior to the date of 
death. If the DROP participant dies before distributions have begun, then the entire 
remaining balance shall be distributed within five years after the DROP participant's 
death. 
e. ?Individual member DROP participant accounts shall be assessed an administrative fee on 
a proportionate basis, taking the costs, fees, and expenses of administration of the fund as 
a whole, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total of the assets in the 
individual member DROP accounts and the denominator of which is the total of the assets 
of the fund as a whole. 
f. ?Nothing herein guarantees any payments from the DROP beyond the amount of the 
individual DROP participant's accumulated account balance.

calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of 
the member's current benefit and there is no impact to the plan. The beneficiary or joint annuitant being 
removed will be assumed deceased by the actuary in determining the actuarially equivalent amount of the 
revised monthly payment. No retirant's current benefit shall be increased as a result of the change of 
beneficiary. No change of retirement option may be made after the date of cashing or depositing the first 
retirement check.

of the amount of reduced pension benefits until death. 
    Form of payment CLife payments with period certain guarantee. The retired member is paid a 
reduced pension for life under form of payment C. Upon the death of the retired member during the 
guaranteed period, the named survivor beneficiary is paid the full amount of the reduced pension for the

presumption of receipt. The affidavit shall also contain the promise to immediately notify the

beginning with the first month for which he or she received a disability retirement income payment 
and ending with the date he or she reentered the service may not be considered as credited service.

    The City of Palatka Firefighters' Pension Fund is hereby amended to provide that the benefits paid to 
retirees and beneficiaries who receiving benefits as of June 1, 2002 will be doubled effective for the July

(Ord. No. 10-01, § 1, 1-28-2010) 


Sec. 2-250.138. - 415 Internal Revenue Code limits. 
(a) ?Basic limitations. Subject to the adjustments in paragraph 3, the maximum amount of the actual 
annual retirement income paid in any year with respect to a participant under this plan attributable to 
employer provided benefits shall not exceed the dollar amount allowable for any calendar year 
pursuant to section 415(b) of the Code, as adjusted in such calendar year for increases in the cost of 
living in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 415(d) of 
the Code. For purposes of applying the basic limitation, benefits payable in any form other than a 
straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits shall be adjusted, as provided by Treasury Regulations, 
so that such benefits are the actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity. For purposes of this 
subsection, the following benefits shall not be taken into account: 
(1) ?Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2) ?Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the Code and Treasury Regulations 
thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of section 415(b)(1) of the 
Code. 
(b) ?Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limitation of this subsection with respect to any 
participant who at any time has been a participant in any other defined benefit plan (as defined in 
section 414(j) of the Code) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all 
defined benefit plans in which the participant has been a participant where payable from one plan. 
(c) ?Adjustments in limitations. 
(1) ?In the event the participant's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the maximum 
amount of annual retirement income limitation prescribed by this article shall be reduced in 
accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions 
of section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limitation (as reduced) equals an annual benefit 
(beginning when such retirement income begins) which is equivalent to the Code Section 415(b) 
maximum amount of annual retirement income beginning at age 62. This limitation shall not 
apply to qualified police or firefighters as that term is defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(G). 
(2) ?In the event the participant's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service, the 
adjustments provided for in subparagraph (1) above shall not apply. 
(3) ?The reductions provided for in subparagraph (a) above shall not be applicable to disability 
benefits or pre-retirement death benefits. 
(4) ?In the event the participant's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of 
determining whether this benefit meets the basic limitation set forth in paragraph (1) herein, 
such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 
65. This adjustment shall be made using an assumed interest rate of five percent and shall be 
made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his 
delegate. 
(5) ?Less than ten years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this article to 
any participant who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city shall be 
the amount determined under paragraph (1) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the number of the participant's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
The reduction provided for in this subparagraph shall not be applicable to disability benefits or 
pre-retirement death benefits. 
(6) ?Ten thousand dollar limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with 
respect to a participant shall be deemed not to exceed the limitations in this subsection if the 
benefits payable, with respect to such participant under this plan and under all other qualified 
defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the 
applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the city has not at any time maintained a 
qualified defined contributions plan in which the participant participated. 
(7) ?Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, 
shall be accomplished by first reducing the participant's benefit under any defined benefit plans 
in which participant participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in 
which participant most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be 
determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing 
or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the participant 
participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which participant most 
recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board 
and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions 
may be made in different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the 
plan administrator of all other plans covering such participant. 
(8) ?Cost-of-living adjustments. The limitations as stated herein shall be adjusted annually in 
accordance with any cost-of-living adjustments prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to section 415(d) of the Code. 
(d) ?This section shall be effective for distributions after December 31, 2001.

Sec. 2-250.139. - Deferred retirement option plan (DROP). 
(a) ?Eligibility to participate in the DROP. 
(1) ?Any member who is eligible to receive a normal retirement pension may participate in the 
DROP. Members shall elect to participate by applying to the board of trustees on a form 
provided for that purpose. 
(2) ?A member cannot participate in the DROP any longer than five years. 
(3) ?Upon a member's election to participate in the DROP, he or she shall cease to be a member 
and is precluded from accruing any additional benefit under the pension fund. For all fund 
purposes, the member becomes a retiree, except that a DROP member may be an elected 
member of the board of trustees. The amount of credited service and final average salary freeze 
as of the date of entry into the DROP. 
(b) ?Amounts payable upon election to participate in DROP. 
(1) ?Monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had the member terminated 
employment with the department and elected to receive monthly pension payments will be paid 
into the DROP and credited to the retiree. Payments into the DROP will be made monthly over 
the period the retiree participates in the DROP, up to a maximum of 60 months. 
(2) ?Payments to the DROP earn interest using the rate of investment return earned on pension 
fund assets during the 12-month period ending September 30th. However, in no event will the 
interest rate be less than an annual rate of five percent. The rate determined shall be the rate as 
reported by the fund's investment monitor. However, if a firefighter does not terminate 
employment at the end of participation in the DROP, interest credits shall cease on the current 
balance and on all future DROP deposits. 
(3) ?No payments will be made from DROP until the member terminates employment with the 
department. 
(4) ?Upon termination of employment, participants in the DROP will receive the balance of the 
DROP account in accordance with the following rules: 
a. ?Members may elect to begin to receive payment upon termination of employment or defer 
payment of DROP until the latest day as provided under sub-subparagraph c. 
b. ?Payments shall be made in either: 
1. ?Lump sum. The entire account balance will be paid to the retiree upon approval of the 
board of trustees. 
2. ?Installments. The account balance will be paid out to the retiree in three equal 
payments paid over three years the first payment to be made upon approval of the 
board of trustees. 
3. ?Annuity. The account balance will be used to purchase an annuity to be paid monthly, 
the first payment to be made upon approval by the board of trustees. The annuity 
must be purchased from an insurer licensed to sell such annuities in Florida. 
c. ?Any form of payment selected by firefighter must comply with the minimum distribution 
requirements of the IRC 401(A)(9). 
d. ?The beneficiary of the DROP participant who dies before payments from DROP begin shall 
have the same right as the participant. 
e. ?Individual member DROP accounts shall be assessed an administrative fee on a 
proportionate basis, taking the costs, fees, and expenses of administration of the fund as a 
whole, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total of the assets in the 
individual member DROP accounts and the denominator of which is the total of the assets 
of the fund as a whole.

the redetermination. The redetermined percent shall be applied prospectively to retired 
members and beneficiaries of deceased retired members. 
The percent effective October 1, 2015, has been redetermined to be 0.66 percent. The percent 
effective October 1, 2016, has been redetermined to be 0.63 percent. The percent effective 
October 1, 2017, has been redetermined to be 0.60 percent. 
(c) ?Payment of a pension on account of retirement under the provisions of section 2-250.175 (normal 
retirement) shall be suspended if the retired member becomes employed by the city in a position that 
would entail membership in the plan were the individual not a retired member or if the member is not 
a mandatory member of this plan. Suspension of the pension shall become effective the first day of 
the calendar month following employment of the retired member. Upon re-employment the member 
shall again accrue service under this plan. Payment of the suspended pension shall resume, 
following recomputation of the benefit based on total years of service less any benefits paid, on the 
first day of the calendar month following termination of employment. A member who retires under the 
normal retirement provision and is at least age 50 is entitled to be re-employed and continue to

regulations including section 1.401(1)-1 provided the retiree is not a mandatory member of this plan. 
The member who continues to receive benefits while employed shall not accrue any additional

(3) ?The retired member was married to the surviving spouse at time of retirement and at time of 
death. 
(b) ?The normal form of pension to an unmarried member or a married member whose surviving spouse 
is not eligible for the benefit in subsection (a) is a ten year certain and life benefit, paid to the 
beneficiary named by the deceased retired member. If there is no beneficiary named, the benefit, if 
any shall be paid to the estate of the deceased retired member. 
(Ord. No. 10-02, § 1, 1-28-2010) 


Sec. 2-250.200. - Forms of payment of a pension. 
    A member may elect to have pension payments made under any one of the following forms of 
payment and name a survivor beneficiary. The election and naming of a survivor beneficiary shall be 
made on a form furnished by and filed with the plan prior to the date the first pension payment is made. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a retired member may change his or her designation 
of joint annuitant or beneficiary up to two times as provided in F.S. § 185.161 without the approval of the 
board of trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree is not required to provide proof 
of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or 
beneficiary being removed need not be living. Any retired member who desires to changes his or her joint 
annuitant or beneficiary shall file with the board of trustees a notarized notice of such change. Upon 
receipt of a completed change of joint annuitant form or such other notice, the board of trustees shall 
adjust the member's monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to 
ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member's current 
benefit and there is no impact to the plan. The beneficiary or joint annuitant being removed will be 
assumed deceased by the actuary in determining the actuarially equivalent amount of the revised monthly 
payment. No retirant's current benefit shall be increased as a result of the change of beneficiary. No 
change of retirement option may be made after the date of cashing or depositing the first retirement 
check. 
    Payment shall be made under the normal form of payment if there is not a timely election of another 
form of payment. 
    The amount of pension under forms of payment SL, A, B and C shall have the same actuarial 
present value, computed as of the effective date of the pension, as the amount of pension under the 
normal form of payment. 
    Form of payment SLStraight life pension. The retired member is paid a pension for life under form 
of payment SL. The amount of pension shall be determined in accordance with section 2-250.185. 
    Form of payment ALife payments with full continuation to survivor beneficiary. The retired member 
is paid a reduced pension for life under form of payment A. Upon the death of the retired member during 
the lifetime of the named survivor beneficiary, the named survivor beneficiary is paid the full amount of 
reduced pension until death. 
    Form of payment BLife payments with continuation to survivor beneficiary. The retired member is 
paid a reduced pension for life under form of payment B. Upon the death of the retired member during the 
lifetime of the named survivor beneficiary, the named survivor beneficiary is paid 75, 66 2/3 or 50 percent 
of the amount of reduced pension benefits until death. 
    Form of payment CLife payments with period certain guarantee. The retired member is paid a 
reduced pension for life under form of payment C. Upon the death of the retired member during the 
guaranteed period, the named survivor beneficiary is paid the full amount of the reduced pension for the 
remainder of the guaranteed period. The guaranteed period shall be 120 months. The actuarial present 
value of the remaining guaranteed payments shall be paid to the legal representative of the retired 
member or the named survivor beneficiary, whoever survives the longer, if both the retired member and 
the named survivor beneficiary die during the guaranteed periods.

Sec. 2-250.205. - Disability retirement; general conditions; special conditions applicable to duty 
disability. 
(a) ?The board of trustees may retire a member who becomes incapacitated for continued employment 
as a police officer if each of the following conditions are met: 
(1) ?Application for disability retirement is filed with the plan by either the member or the city within 
one year of the date the member ceases to be paid by the city; 
(2) ?The member has ten or more years of credited service; 
(3) ?The member undergoes all medical examinations and tests ordered by the plan, and releases 
to the plan all medical reports and records requested by the plan; and 
(4) ?The medical advisor selected by the board of trustees reports that: (i) the member is mentally 
or physically incapacitated for continued employment as a police officer; (ii) the disability is likely 
to continue for at least one year (to be permanent); and (iii) the member should be retired. The 
effective date of a disability retirement shall not predate (i) the date of disability, or (ii) the date 
the member ceases to be paid by the city. 
(b) ?The amount of a disability pension shall be computed according to section 2-250.185 and shall not 
be less than 25 percent of the police officer's average monthly salary at the time of disability. The 
disability retired member shall have the right to elect a form of payment provided in section 2-
250.200. 
(c) ?The following exceptions to the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) shall apply if the board of 
trustees finds that the member's disability is the direct result of the member's performance of duty as 
an employee of the city: 
(1) ?The requirement of ten years of credited service shall be waived. 
(2) ?The amount of pension shall not be less than 45 percent of the police officer's average monthly 
salary for the last five years at the time of the disability. If the member does not have five years 
of service at the time of the disability, the amount of pension shall not be less than 45 percent of 
the police officer's average monthly salary for the total months of service at the time of disability. 
(d) ?A police officer will not be entitled to receive any disability retirement income if the disability is a 
result of: 
(1) ?Excessive and habitual use by the police officer of drugs, intoxicants, or narcotics; 
(2) ?Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while willfully and illegally participating in fights, 
riots, or civil insurrections or while committing a crime; 
(3) ?Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while serving in any armed forces. Effective on 
and after January 1, 2007, this exclusion does not affect members who have become disabled 
as a result of intervening military service under the federal Heroes Earnings and Assistance and 
Relief Tax Act of 2007 (H.R. 6081; P.L. 110-245); 
(4) ?Injury or disease sustained by the police officer after his or her employment has terminated; or 
(5) ?Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while working for anyone other than the city 
and arising out of such employment. 
(Ord. No. 10-02, § 1, 1-28-2010) 


Sec. 2-250.210. - Disability retirement; limitation on amount of pension. 
(a) ?The provisions of this section shall apply during the period, if any, between the effective date of a 
disability pension and the date the disability retired member attains age of 65 years. Application of 
the limitation shall be to the amount of pension under the normal form of payment. The effect of an 
election of any other form of payment shall be taken into account after application of the provisions of 
this section. 
(b) ?When a retired member is receiving a disability pension, Social Security, and/or workers' 
compensation benefits, and the total monthly benefits received from these exceed 100 percent of the 
member's final average compensation, the disability pension shall be reduced so that the total 
monthly pension received by the retired member does not exceed 100 percent of such final average 
compensation. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to 
an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 
83.9692. In no event shall the retired member be denied the minimum benefits provided in F.S. ch. 
185. 
(c) ?The plan shall compute the initial amount of pension on the presumption the retired member is 
receiving Social Security disability benefits and worker's compensation periodic benefits. The 
presumed amounts shall be estimated by the plan using the retired member's final average 
compensation and the single person statutory benefits. The retired member may, at any time, submit 
evidence of receipt of a lesser amount of Social Security or worker's compensation benefits. The 
plan shall adjust the amount of pension to reflect actual Social Security and worker's compensation 
benefits if it finds the submitted evidence substantiates the disability retired member's claim. 
(d) ?The disability retired member may submit an affidavit declaring that an application for Social 
Security or worker's compensation benefits will not be made, thereby voiding application of the 
presumption of receipt. The affidavit shall also contain the promise to immediately notify the plan 
should an application be made for Social Security or worker's compensation benefits. 
(e) ?The plan shall periodically request substantiated income information from disability retired members 
subject to this section. Failure to provide the requested information within 90 days of the request 
shall cause suspension of payment of the pension until the information is received. 
(Ord. No. 10-02, § 1, 1-28-2010) 


Sec. 2-250.215. - Disability retirement; continuation subject to reexamination; suspension/termination 
of pension. 
(a) ?The plan may require a disability retired member to undergo periodic medical or other reevaluation if 
the individual does not satisfy an applicable age and/or service requirement for normal retirement. If 
the disability retired member refuses to submit to reevaluation, payment of the pension may be 
suspended by the board of trustees. If the refusal continues for one year, the board of trustees may 
revoke the disability retired member's rights in and to the disability pension. A disability pension shall 
be discontinued if the medical advisor selected by the board of trustees reports that the disability 
retired member is no longer disabled in that he or she is able to render useful and efficient service as 
a police officer and the board of trustees concurs with the report. 
(b) ?The membership status of a terminated disability retired member who is returned to city employment 
shall be governed by the provisions of section 2-250.150. If a police officer recovers from a disability 
and reenters the service as a police officer, service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the 
period beginning with the first month for which he or she received a disability retirement income 
payment and ending with the date he or she reentered the service may not be considered as 
credited service. However, credited service shall be granted for the first 30 days of disability 
retirement during which the disability retired member is paid worker's compensation periodic benefits 
on account of the disability for which retired. 
(c) ?A terminated disability retired member who does not reacquire membership and restoration of 
credited service, as provided in subsection (b), shall have actual credited service at time of disability 
retirement restored if such restoration enables the individual to become a vested former member.

prior to the first day of the month following date the deceased active member would have satisfied an 
age and/or service requirement for retirement pursuant to section 2-250.175 had the deceased 
active member continued in city employment. 
(c) ?The amount of a deceased active member's accrued pension shall be computed as if the deceased 
member had retired the day preceding death under the normal retirement provisions and elected the 
normal form of payment. 
(d) ?The normal form of pension to an unmarried active member or a married active member whose 
surviving spouse is not eligible for the benefit in subsection (a) is a ten year certain and life benefit, 
paid to the beneficiary named by the deceased retired member. If there is no beneficiary named, the

companies, the board may utilize the list of scrutinized companies as developed by the Florida State 
Board of Administration. No person may bring any civil, criminal, or administrative action against the

Sec. 2-250.380. - 415 Internal Revenue Code limits. 
(a) ?Basic limitations. Subject to the adjustments in paragraph 3, the maximum amount of the actual 
annual retirement income paid in any year with respect to a participant under this plan attributable to 
employer provided benefits shall not exceed the dollar amount allowable for any calendar year 
pursuant to section 415(b) of the Code, as adjusted in such calendar year for increases in the cost of 
living in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 415(d) of 
the Code. For purposes of applying the basic limitation, benefits payable in any form other than a 
straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits shall be adjusted, as provided by Treasury Regulations, 
so that such benefits are the actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity. For purposes of this 
subsection, the following benefits shall not be taken into account: 
(1) ?Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2) ?Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the Code and Treasury Regulations 
thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of section 415(b)(1) of the 
Code. 
(b) ?Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limitation of this subsection with respect to any 
participant who at any time has been a participant in any other defined benefit plan (as defined in 
section 414(j) of the Code) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all 
defined benefit plans in which the participant has been a participant where payable from one plan. 
(c) ?Adjustments in limitations. 
(1) ?In the event the participant's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the maximum 
amount of annual retirement income limitation prescribed by this article shall be reduced in 
accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions 
of section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limitation (as reduced) equals an annual benefit 
(beginning when such retirement income begins) which is equivalent to the Code section 415(b) 
maximum amount of annual retirement income beginning at age 62. This limitation shall not 
apply to qualified police or firefighters as that term is defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(G). 
(2) ?In the event the participant's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service, the 
adjustments provided for in subparagraph (1) above shall not apply. 
(3) ?The reductions provided for in subparagraph (a) above shall not be applicable to disability 
benefits or pre-retirement death benefits. 
(4) ?In the event the participant's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of 
determining whether this benefit meets the basic limitation set forth in paragraph (1) herein, 
such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 
65. This adjustment shall be made using an assumed interest rate of five percent and shall be 
made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his 
delegate. 
(5) ?Less than ten years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this article to 
any participant who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city shall be 
the amount determined under paragraph (1) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the number of the participant's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
The reduction provided for in this subparagraph shall not be applicable to disability benefits or 
pre-retirement death benefits. 
(6) ?Ten thousand dollar limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with 
respect to a participant shall be deemed not to exceed the limitations in this subsection if the 
benefits payable, with respect to such participant under this plan and under all other qualified 
defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the 
applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the city has not at any time maintained a 
qualified defined contributions plan in which the participant participated. 
(7) ?Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, 
shall be accomplished by first reducing the participant's benefit under any defined benefit plans 
in which participant participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in 
which participant most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be 
determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing 
or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the participant 
participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which participant most 
recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board 
and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions 
may be made in different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the 
plan administrator of all other plans covering such participant. 
(8) ?Cost-of-living adjustments. The limitations as stated herein shall be adjusted annually in 
accordance with any cost-of-living adjustments prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to section 415(d) of the Code. 
(d) ?This section shall be effective for distributions after December 31, 2001.

for contractors or permit holders with delinquent accounts is specifically prohibited until such 
accounts are paid in full. The city has the right to refuse terms of credit to any user who becomes 
delinquent in payment of accounts.

the proceedings. 
(e) ?Decision; issuance of order; voting. At the conclusion of the hearing, the enforcement board shall 
issue findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue an order affording the proper relief 
consistent with powers granted in this division. The findings shall be by motion approved by a

must vote in favor of the action to be official. 
(f) ?[ Failure of alleged violator to appear. ] Once the alleged violator(s) has been properly noticed as to 
the hearing before the board and if the violator(s) fails to appear, the board may proceed with a 
hearing on the merits of the alleged violation. Any findings or orders resulting from such hearing are 
valid and binding upon said violator(s) if a violation is found to exist. 
(g) ?[ Failure of owner to appear. ]Once the owner(s) of the property at which the alleged violation has 
occurred has been properly notified of the hearing before the board and fails to appear, the board 
may proceed with a hearing on the merits of the alleged violation and any findings or orders are valid 
and binding against said owner(s). 
(h) ?[ Corporation as violator or owner. ] If a corporation is either the violator or the owner of the 
property, notice as outlined herein shall be affected upon the designated registered agent. If the 
corporation is a foreign corporation that has failed to comply with F.S. § 48.091, notice shall be 
permitted to be served upon any employee at the corporation's place of business or any agent

( Ord. No. 14-18 , § 1, 7-10-2014) 


Sec. 2-287. - Powers. 
    The enforcement board shall have the power to:

violation into compliance. 
( Ord. No. 14-18 , § 1, 7-10-2014) 


Sec. 2-288. - Fines. 
(a) ?The code enforcement board, upon notification by the code enforcement officer that an order of the 
code enforcement board has not been complied with by the set time, or upon finding that a repeat 
violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this 
section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the enforcement board for 
compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, 
beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code enforcement 
officer. 
    In addition, if the violation is a violation described in F.S. § 162.06(4), the code enforcement board 
may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the 
violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
    If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this division, a hearing 
shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, the 
code enforcement board finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the 
violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b) ?A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and 
shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation, and, in addition, may include all costs of 
repairs pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. However, if the code enforcement board finds the 
violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per 
violation. In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the enforcement board shall consider the 
following factors: 
(1) ?The gravity of the violation; 
(2) ?Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3) ?Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
    The enforcement board may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
(c) ?A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records and thereafter 
shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or 
personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be 
enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against 
the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for 
enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the 
violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed 
pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this 
section runs in favor of the city commission, and the city commission may execute a satisfaction or 
release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three months from the filing of any such lien 
which remains unpaid, the enforcement board may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the 
lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this division may be foreclosed on real property 
which is a homestead under section 4, article X of the state constitution. 
(d) ?No lien provided under the Local Government Code Enforcement Boards Act (F.S. § 162.01 et seq.) 
shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine 
has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court 
of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover 
all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The city commission 
shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation 
of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or 
subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is 
recorded. 
( Ord. No. 14-18 , § 1, 7-10-2014) 


Sec. 2-289. - Appeals; other enforcement methods. 
(a) ?An aggrieved party, including the city, may appeal a final administrative order of the enforcement 
board to the circuit court of the county. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the 
order. Regardless of the outcome of the appeal, each party shall pay their own respective costs and 
attorney's fees as incurred in prosecuting and/or defending the appeal. 
(b) ?Nothing contained in this article shall prohibit the city from enforcing its codes by any other means. 
It is the intent of this article to provide an additional or supplemental means of obtaining compliance 
with city codes. 
( Ord. No. 14-18 , § 1, 7-10-2014) 


Sec. 2-290. - Notices. 
(a) ?All notices required by this division shall be provided to the alleged violator by certified mail, return 
receipt requested; by hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code inspector or 
other person designated by the city commission; or by delivery of the notice by anyone authorized to 
effect hand delivery at the violator's usual place of residence to any person residing therein who is 
above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice. 
(b) ?In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, at the option of the code 
enforcement board, notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(1) ?Such notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four 
publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The 
newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50 for legal and 
official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 
50.051. 
(2) ?In lieu of publication as described in subsection (b)(1) of this section, such notice may be 
posted for at least ten days in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon 
which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at the primary municipal 
government office. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which 
affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(3) ?Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt to provide 
notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a) of this section. Evidence 
that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in subsection (a) of 
this section, together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection (b) of this 
section, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this article have been met, 
without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice.

( Ord. No. 14-26 , § 1, 9-25-2014) 


Sec. 2-315. - Violations procedure; notice of violation; refusal to accept citation; failure to pay civil 
penalty or appear before the code enforcement board. 
(a) ?A code enforcement officer is authorized to issue a citation to a person when, based upon personal 
investigation, the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed a civil 
infraction in violation of a duly enacted city code or ordinance. However, prior to issuing a citation, a 
code enforcement officer shall provide notice to the person that the person has committed a violation 
of a code or ordinance and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the person must 
correct the violation. Such time period shall be no more than 30 days. If, upon personal investigation, 
a code enforcement officer finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the time 
period, a code enforcement officer may issue a citation to the person who has committed the 
violation. A code enforcement officer does not have to provide the person with a reasonable time 
period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation and may immediately issue a citation if a 
repeat violation is found or if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe that the violation 
presents a serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or 
irreversible. 
(b) ?A code enforcement officer shall issue a notice of violation and/or citation in a form prescribed by 
the city and it shall contain: 
(1) ?The date and time of issuance. 
(2) ?The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued. 
(3) ?The date and time the civil infraction was committed. 
(4) ?The facts constituting reasonable cause. 
(5) ?The number or section of the code or ordinance violated. 
(6) ?The name and authority of the code enforcement officer or law enforcement officer. 
(7) ?The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil penalty or to contest the citation. 
(8) ?The applicable civil penalty if the person elects to contest the citation. 
(9) ?The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest the citation. 
(10) ?A conspicuous statement that, if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time 
allowed, or fails to appear in court to contest the citation, he shall be deemed to have waived his 
right to contest the citation and that, in such case, judgment may be entered against the person 
for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty. 
(c) ?Any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by a code enforcement officer 
shall be guilty of a violation, punishable as provided in F.S. § 775.082 or 775.083. 
(d) ?Rights of violator. A violator who has been served with a citation shall elect either to: 
(1) ?Pay the civil penalty in the manner indicated on the infraction notice, and correct the violation; 
or 
(2) ?Request an administrative hearing before the code enforcement board to appeal the 
determination of the code enforcement officer which resulted in the issuance of the citation. Any 
person appealing to the code enforcement board or ordered before the code enforcement board 
due to non corrected violations shall be subject to payment of administrative fees in the amount 
of $50.00 see 2-314 per appearance before the code enforcement board. If on appeal, the 
violator prevails, no administrative fee will be levied. 
(e) ?If a person fails to pay the civil penalty or fails to appear before the code enforcement board to 
contest the citation, the code enforcement board may record in the public records a certified copy of 
an order imposing civil penalty and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the 
violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator.

Chapter 3 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 


Sec. 3-1. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "adult entertainment code." 
(Ord. No. 01-29, § 2, 9-27-2001) 


Sec. 3-2. - Authority. 
    This chapter is enacted under the home rule power of the City of Palatka in the interest of the health, 
peace, safety, morals, and general welfare of the people of the city, and under the mandate of the people 
as expressed by public hearings held before the board of city commissioners on June 19, 2001 and on 
July 19, 2001, and on August 16, 2001 and under the authority of the City of Palatka to regulate the sale 
and consumption of alcoholic beverages under the Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, which authority, in part, was confirmed and specifically delegated to the city by Laws of 
Florida Chapters 80-559, and the Municipal Home Rule Powers Act, Florida Statute Section 166.011 et 
seq. and the beverage control laws, Florida Statute Chapter 561 et seq. 
(Ord. No. 01-29, § 3, 9-27-2001) 


Sec. 3-3. - Construction. 
    This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose of licensing and regulating adult 
entertainment businesses and establishments and related activities. Unless otherwise indicated, all 
provisions of this chapter shall apply equally to all persons regardless of gender. The words "he," "his," 
and "him," as employed in this chapter shall be construed to apply to females as well as to males. 
(Ord. No. 01-29, § 4, 9-27-2001) 


Sec. 3-4. - Purpose. 
    The intent of the board of city commissioners in adopting this chapter is to establish reasonable and 
uniform regulations that will reduce the negative secondary effects adult entertainment businesses have 
upon the city, and to protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people of the City of 
Palatka. It is not the intent of the board of city commissioners to legislate with respect to matters of 
obscenity because such matters are regulated by federal and state law, including F.S. ch. 847. The 
provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing an unreasonable limitation or 
unreasonable restriction on the content of any lawful communicative materials including sexually oriented 
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to unreasonably restrict or deny access by 
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by the 
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment to their 
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution 
of obscene or otherwise illegal material. 
(Ord. No. 01-29, § 5, 9-27-2001) 


Sec. 3-5. - Findings of facts. 
    Based on evidence and testimony presented at public hearings before the board of city 
commissioners on various dates, which included a presentation indicating the negative secondary effects 
of adult entertainment establishments and sexually oriented businesses in other communities in the 
United States, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 
U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501

photographs, affidavits, and other documents submitted at those public hearings relating to the ordinance, 
along with the board's knowledge of actual conditions in the City of Palatka, the board of city 
commissioners hereby find: 
(1) ?Establishments exist, have existed, or may exist within the city where adult material constitutes 
a substantial portion of the material displayed, exhibited, distributed, rented or sold, or offered 
for rent or sale. 
(2) ?Establishments exist, have existed, or may exist within the city: 
a. ?Where the superficial tissues of one person are manipulated, rubbed, stroked, kneaded, 
and/or tapped by a second person, accompanied by the display or exposure of specified 
anatomical areas; 
b. ?Where the business is distinguished by an emphasis on, or the promotion of, dancers, 
entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for any form of commercial gain, 
perform or are presented while displaying or exposing any specified anatomical area or 
perform or are presented while simulating or otherwise giving the appearance of the 
display or exposure of any specified anatomical areas; 
c. ?Where workers dance or perform with or within three feet of customers in consideration for 
tips, remuneration or compensation from or on behalf of those customers, or offer, solicit or 
contract to do the same, and the product, service or entertainment is intended to provide 
sexual stimulation or sexual gratification to such customers; or 
d. ?Where straddle dancing, private modeling, prostitution, unlawful drug transactions, or lewd 
and lascivious touching occurs between customers and workers or performers. 
(3) ?Establishments exist, have existed, or may exist within the city and surrounding counties where 
sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of 
commercial physical contact, or escort services. The workers of such sexually oriented 
businesses engage in physical contact or touching with customers, including acts of prostitution, 
or encourage or entice customers to engage in acts of lewdness. 
(4) ?The activities described in subsection (1), (2) and (3) occur at establishments for the purpose 
of making a profit, and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the health, 
safety, morals and general welfare of the people of the City of Palatka. 
(5) ?When the activities described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) are present in establishments 
within the city, other activities which are illegal, immoral, or unhealthful tend to accompany 
them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but 
are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious 
behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of 
obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against 
persons and property. 
(6) ?When the activities described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) are present in establishments 
within the city they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, 
adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote crime, particularly 
the kinds detailed in subsection (5), and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to 
other locations. 
(7) ?The establishments in which the activities described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) occur are 
usually constructed, in part or in whole, of substandard materials, and are usually maintained in 
a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants, and have exterior 
appearance and/or signage that depreciates the value of adjoining real property and otherwise 
contributes to urban decline. 
(8) ?The activities described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) frequently occur in establishments 
concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
(9) ?The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities 
described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) leads to an increase in criminal activity, moral 
degradation, and disturbances of the peace and order of the city. 
(10) ?The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities 
described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons 
in attendance, depreciates the value of adjoining real property, harms the economic welfare of 
the city and adversely affects the public's interest in the quality of life, tone of commerce, and 
community environment in the city. 
(11) ?In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the 
people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to prohibit the sale and consumption 
of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1), (2) 
and (3) occur. 
(12) ?Workers of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) 
engage in a higher incidence of certain types of criminal behavior than workers of other 
establishments, including prostitution and lewdness in violation of F.S. ch. 796 operating without 
an occupational license, and operating unlicensed massage parlors and cosmetology 
businesses. 
(13) ?Physical contact within establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1), (2) 
and (3) occur between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a 
threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually 
transmissible diseases. 
(14) ?In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the 
citizenry of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, 
managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers at 
establishments where the activities described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) occur. 
(15) ?The potential dangers to the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizenry of the 
city posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections (1), 
(2) and (3) occur to operate without first obtaining a license under this chapter are so great as to 
require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. A 
thorough but prompt investigation and review of a license application will facilitate this public 
purpose. Suspension or revocation of adult entertainment licenses at which repeated specified 
criminal acts, as defined in section 3-6, are allowed to occur upon adequate proof at 
administrative proceedings of the occurrence of such acts, will serve to protect the community 
from such danger by deterring or ending the use of the establishment for future specified 
criminal acts. Access to prompt judicial review by the circuit court of administrative suspension 
and revocation proceedings will protect the rights of the licensee. 
(16) ?Requiring licensees of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1), (2) 
and (3) occur to keep a list of information concerning current workers and certain past workers 
will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the 
identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors from working in such 
establishments. 
(17) ?Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) 
occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, areas 
zoned for residential use, and parks, at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect 
minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
(18) ?Straddle dancing and lewd and lascivious touching between customers and workers or 
performers does not contain any element of communication, and is therefore conduct rather 
than expression. 
(19) ?Straddle dancing, prostitution, sexual activity, and lewd and lascivious touching between 
customers and workers or performers in adult entertainment establishments poses a threat to 
the health of the participants and promotes or actually causes the spread of communicable and 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
(20) ?The practice of not paying workers at sexually oriented businesses and requiring them to earn 
their entire income from tips or gratuities from customers who are predisposed to desire or want 
sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness. 
(21) ?Sexually oriented businesses involve activities that are pure conduct engaged in and for the 
purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity, and therefore are subject 
to and require increased regulation to protect the health, welfare and safety of the community. 
(22) ?Requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict 
services to those listed as well as to maintain worker records will discourage incidents of 
criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution, thereby further safeguarding the health of 
both workers and customers and assisting in the facilitation of the identification of potential 
witnesses or suspects if criminal acts occur. 
(23) ?Close personal or physical contact between customers and performers at adult entertainment 
establishments who are displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas, facilitates and 
encourages the exchange of money for prostitution, lewd touching, and other illegal activity 
which poses a danger to the community and the participants. 
(24) ?Requiring performers at adult entertainment establishments, who are displaying or exposing 
specified anatomical areas, to remain on stage and at least three feet away from customers 
who are in the establishment will serve to protect the public by discouraging and making more 
difficult direct physical contact which results in incidents of criminal behavior, such as 
prostitution, and unlawful lewd or lascivious touching between performers and customers. 
(25) ?Operators or workers of adult entertainment establishments who have the authority to direct 
or control other workers at, or the operation of, an adult entertainment establishment, should be 
subject to penalties for allowing violations of this chapter to occur in order to deter and 
discourage such operators from allowing or encouraging violations of this article to occur for the 
purpose of increasing profits at the establishment to the detriment of the community and 
contrary to the purposes of this chapter. 
(26) ?When reviewing applications for adult entertainment licenses, the zoning administrator's 
consideration of all information received in a timely manner from any of the investigating or 
reviewing departments will best protect the public and facilitate proper licensing consistent with 
the purposes of this chapter. 
(27) ?The purpose of the suspension and revocation proceedings will be undermined if such 
suspensions or revocations are avoided by licensees being allowed to incorporate under new 
names or by attempts to transfer licenses or by change in control of land or establishments 
during a pending suspension or revocation proceeding. 
(Ord. No. 01-29, § 6, 9-27-2001) 


Sec. 3-6. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings 
ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Adult bookstore shall mean an establishment where a substantial portion of the items, material, 
goods or products sold or rented, offered for sale or rent, displayed or exhibited constitutes adult material.

sale or rent, displayed, or exhibited at a commercial establishment does not depend upon a

necessarily all, of the following factors:

entertainment establishment. 
    Adult material shall mean any one or more of the following, regardless of whether it is new or used: 
(1) ?Books, magazines, periodicals or other printed matter, or photographs, films, motion pictures,

to customers of a product, service or entertainment which is intended to provide sexual 
stimulation or sexual gratification to such customers, including an establishment which is 
distinguished by an emphasis on, or the promotion of specified sexual activities or the 
presentation or rental of films, motion pictures, videocassettes, slides or other photographic 
reproductions, which have as their primary or dominant theme matters depicting, illustrating or 
relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas; or 
(3) ?Where any room with sleeping accommodations is rented or otherwise made available to a 
customer for a period of eight hours or less and the customer is required to vacate such room 
before the 8:00 a.m. which follows the time of rental.

(2) ?This definition is not intended to apply, and it is an affirmative defense to an alleged violation of 
this chapter regarding operating an adult performance establishment without a license, if the 
alleged violator demonstrates either: 
a. ?That the establishment is a bona fide private club whose membership as a whole engages 
in social nudism or naturalism as in a nudist resort or camp, or 
b. ?That the predominant business or attraction of the establishment is not the offering to 
customers of a product, service, or entertainment which is intended to provide sexual 
stimulation or sexual gratification to such customers, and the establishment and its 
advertising is not distinguished by an emphasis on, or the promotion of, matters or persons 
depicting, describing, displaying, exposing, simulating or relating to specified sexual 
activities or specified anatomical areas. 
(3) ?Consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida in the case of Hoffman v. Carson, 
250 So. 2d 891, 893 (Fla. 1971), appeal dismissed 404 U.S. 981 (1971), an adult dancing 
establishment shall not be deemed a place provided or set apart for the purpose of exposing or 
exhibiting a person's sexual organs in a manner contrary to the first sentence of F.S. § 800.03, 
the state's indecent exposure statute.

bottle or can labeled as any of the above names, or a name similar thereto, and the bottle or can bears 
the manufacturer's insignia, name, or trademark. Any person who, by experience in the handling of 
alcoholic beverages, or who by taste, smell, or drinking of such alcoholic beverages has knowledge of the 
alcoholic nature thereof, may testify as to his opinion about whether such beverage is an alcoholic

operated for commercial or pecuniary gain, which does any of the following:

(2) ?Offers or actually provides, arranges, dispatches, or refers workers to act as an escort for a 
customer. 
Exception: It is an affirmative defense that a business is not an escort service if a person 
seeking to invoke this defense can demonstrate that the business is a bona fide dating or 
matching service which arranges social matches or dates for two persons who each wish to 
meet a compatible companion when neither person solicits, accepts, or receives any financial 
gain or any monetary tip, consideration, or compensation from any person for the meeting or 
date.

Sec. 30-73. - Storage of abandoned property removed by city. 
    The enforcement officer is authorized to take possession of and store abandoned property found on 
public property whenever the abandoned property apparently is of more than nominal value and may be 
subject to destruction, damage or loss if it remains where the enforcement officer found it. The storage 
charges, if any, occasioned by the storage of the abandoned property pursuant to this section shall be 
and constitute a lien upon the stored abandoned property, and shall be paid or otherwise satisfied before

Sec. 30-74. - Removal by city authorized; payment of costs. 
    If no pre-taking hearing has been requested under this article, or if requested, the decision resulting 
from the hearing upholds the propriety of the actions of the enforcement officer in determining that a 
public nuisance does thereby exist, actions of the enforcement officer in determining that a public 
nuisance does thereby exist, the junked vehicle when on private property and abandoned articles shall be 
promptly removed and disposed of pursuant to the following procedure:

owner or any person interested in the abandoned article described in such notice has not 
removed the article and complied with the ordinance or regulation cited in the notice, the 
enforcement officer may cause the junked vehicle or articles of abandoned property to be 
removed and destroyed. The salvage value, if any, of such articles shall be retained by the 
removal company and/or the city to be applied against the cost of removal and destruction 
thereof, unless the costs of removal, storage and destruction are paid by the owner as provided 
in subsection (2) of this section, in which case the salvage value may be deposited in the 
general fund, or as otherwise determined by the city. 
(2) ?The owner of any abandoned motor vehicle or boat who, after notice as provided in this 
section, does not remove the vehicle or boat within the specified period shall be liable for all 
cost of removal and destruction of such property, less any salvage value received. In the case 
of an abandoned boat, any person who neglects or refuses to pay such amount shall not be 
entitled to be issued a certificate of registration for any other boat until such costs have been 
paid. The enforcement officer shall supply the state department of environmental protection with 
a list of persons whose boat registration privileges have been revoked under this subsection;

successor body, standards of the state and other applicable industry standards. The following words, 
terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this 
section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    A-weighted sound level means the sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound level 
meter using the A-weighting network. The level so read is designated dB(A). 
    Classification of use occupancies. For the purpose of defining the use occupancy, all premises 
containing habitually occupied sleeping quarters shall be considered in residential use. All premises 
containing transient commercial sleeping quarters shall be considered commercial use. All premises 
containing a business where sales, professional or another commercial use is legally permitted shall be 
considered commercial use. All premises where manufacturing is legally permitted shall be considered 
manufacturing use. In case of multiple use, the more restrictive use category shall prevail. Hospitals, 
nursing homes, schools, libraries and church uses shall be considered residential uses. Any area not 
otherwise classified shall conform to commercial standards. 
    Decibel (dB) is a unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm in the 
base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure, which is 20 
micronewtons per square meter. 
    Emergency work means any work performed for the purpose of preventing or alleviating physical 
trauma or property damage threatened or caused by an existing or imminent peril. 
    Noise control officer (NCO) means the chief of police of the city and/or the person designated by the 
chief of police. 
    Sound level means the weighted sound pressure level obtained by the use of a sound level meter 
and frequency weighting network, such as A, B or C, as specified in American National Standards 
Institute specification for sound level meters (ANSI SI.4-1971, or the latest approved version thereof). If 
the frequency weighting employed is not indicated, the A-weighting shall apply. 
    Sound level meter means an instrument which includes a microphone, amplifier, RMS detector, 
response dampening circuit, output meter and weighting network used to measure sound pressure levels. 
    Sound pressure level means 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the RMS sound 
pressure to the reference of 20 micronewtons per square meter. 
(b) ?Measurement standards. Standards, instrumentation, personnel, measurement procedures and 
reporting procedures to be used in the measurement of sound as provided for in this article shall be 
consistent with accepted and sound principles of noise measurement in accord with the standards of 
the American National Standards Institute or its successor body, standards of the state or other 
applicable industry standards. 
(Code 1981, § 13-52) 
Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2. 


Sec. 30-103. - Penalty; additional remedies. 
(a) ?Criminal penalty. Any person violating the provisions of this article shall, upon conviction, be subject 
to the penalties provided for in section 1-10. 
(b) ?Civil proceedings. Upon determination by the noise control officer that a source of noise is being 
conducted in violation of this article, in addition to other remedies provided in this article and by the 
laws of the state, the noise control officer may, upon authorization by the city commission, institute 
any appropriate action or proceedings to restrain, correct or abate such violations or otherwise 
prevent the unlawful use of such noise operation or the unlawful operation of such facility by any 
person. 
(Code 1981, § 13-59) 


Sec. 30-104. - Enforcement. 
    The noise control officer shall have the primary enforcement responsibility for this article. The noise 
control officer shall coordinate with federal and state authorities and as necessary enforce federal 
statutes and regulations to the extent authorized by the federal Quiet Communities Act and other 
applicable law.

seconds. Testing of the complete emergency signaling system, including the functioning of the 
signaling device and the personnel response to the signaling device, shall not occur more than 
once in each calendar month unless additional testing is permitted by special permit issued by 
the city manager. Such testing shall occur only on weekdays and not before 7:00 a.m. or after 
10:00 p.m. and shall be exempt from the time limit specified in this subsection. The sounding or 
permitting the sounding of any exterior burglar or fire alarm or any motor vehicle burglar alarm, 
unless such alarm is automatically terminated within 15 minutes of activation, shall be 
prohibited. 
(8) ?Motorboats. No person shall operate or permit the operation of any motorboat in any lake, river, 
stream, canal, bay or other waterway in such a manner as to cause unnecessary and excessive 
noise within a residential area or noise-sensitive zone, or to exceed 85 dB(A) when measured at 
least 50 feet from the craft (single incident, any mode of operation). 
(9) ?Noise-sensitive zones. 
a. ?No person shall create or cause any excessive and unnecessary noise within or adjacent 
to any noise-sensitive zone containing a hospital, nursing home, school, court or other 
designated area, provided that conspicuous signs are displayed indicating the presence of 
the noise-sensitive zone. Noise-sensitive zones are those zones created by resolution of 
the city commission upon a finding that the subject area contains a land use which is 
sensitive to or subject to adverse reactions from noise. 
b. ?No person shall create or cause any sound within any noise-sensitive zone so as to exceed 
the decibel levels set forth for such zone when measured at a distance of at least 25 feet 
(7.5 meters) from the sound source, provided that conspicuous signs are displayed

( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 1.02, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-93. - Findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that: 
(1) ?Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2(b) of the Florida Constitution, and F.S. §§ 166.021 and 
166.041, the city commission has all powers of local self-government to perform municipal 
functions and render municipal services except when prohibited by law and such power may be 
exercised by the enactment of city ordinances. 
(2) ?The city commission may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary power for a 
municipal purpose except when expressly prohibited by law, and the city commission may 
legislate on any subject matter on which the Florida Legislature may act, except those subjects 
described in F.S. § 166.021(3)(a)(d). The subject matter of F.S. § 166.021(3)(a)(d) is not 
relevant to the imposition of assessments related to fire protection services, facilities or 
programs. 
(3) ?The special benefits to affected lands provided as a result of an assessment include, by way of 
example and not limitation, the continual availability of fire protection services to each tax parcel 
within the city, protection of public safety, stable or decreasing insurance costs, a potential 
increase in value to property, and an assured level of service to landowners and tenants. 
(4) ?The constant and continued preparedness to provide fire protection services, facilities and 
programs possess a logical relationship to the value, use and enjoyment of real property by: 
a. ?Protecting the value of the improvements and structures through the continual availability 
of fire control and provision of fire protection and associated rescue services; 
b. ?Protecting the life and safety of intended occupants in the use and enjoyment of real 
property; 
c. ?Lowering the cost of casualty or liability insurance by the presence of a professional and 
comprehensive fire protection and associated rescue program within the city; 
d. ?Providing protection for uninsured or underinsured property and property owners; and 
e. ?Containing the spread of fire incidents, sometimes occurring on vacant or undeveloped 
property, with the potential to spread and endanger the structures and occupants of nearby 
improved property, thereby limiting liability. 
(5) ?The combined fire control and associated basic life support emergency medical services of the 
city under its existing fire protection program enhances and strengthens the relationship of such 
services to the value, use and enjoyment of the parcels of property within the city. 
(6) ?The assessment imposed pursuant to this article is imposed by the city commission, not the 
property appraiser or tax collector. Any activity of the property appraiser or tax collector under 
the provisions of this article shall be construed as ministerial. 
(7) ?The annual assessments to be imposed pursuant to this article are special assessments and 
may also constitute and be described as non-ad valorem assessments within the meaning and 
intent of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(8) ?The purpose of this article is to: 
a. ?Provide procedures and standards for the imposition of city-wide assessments under the 
home rule powers of a municipality to impose special assessments; 
b. ?Authorize a procedure for the funding of fire protection services, facilities, or programs 
providing special benefits to property within the city; and 
c. ?Establish a revenue or tax equity tool for funding fire protection services, facilities and 
programs, reduce demand on other legally available funds, allow for local policy discretion 
as difficult overall budget choices are made by the city commission each year, and give the 
community a more equitable, balanced, sustainable and dedicated means of funding 
essential fire protection related services and capital improvements.

DIVISION 2. - ANNUAL FIRE SERVICE ASSESSMENTS 


Sec. 34-101. - General authority. 
(a) ?The city commission is hereby authorized to impose an annual assessment to fund all or any portion 
of the fire service assessed cost upon benefitted property at a rate of assessment based on the 
special benefit accruing to such property from the city's provision of fire protection services, facilities, 
or programs. For purposes of this article, references to "benefit," "special benefit," "benefited 
property" or the like also include the relief of a burden to continually stand in readiness created by 
real property as well as improvements thereon. All assessments shall be imposed in conformity with 
the procedures set forth in this division 2. 
(b) ?The amount of the annual assessment imposed each fiscal year against each parcel of assessed 
property shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology based upon a fair and 
reasonable apportionment of the fire service assessed cost among properties on a basis reasonably 
related to the special benefit provided by the availability of fire protection services, facilities, or 
programs funded with assessment proceeds. The amount of the annual assessment imposed each 
fiscal year shall include administration and collection costs associated with the annual assessment. 
In the event the assessments are collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the 
amount of the annual assessment will also include fees imposed by the property appraiser and tax 
collector and will be adjusted as necessary to account for any statutory discounts which are 
necessitated when employing the efficiencies of collecting the assessments annually on the same bill 
as property taxes. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to require the imposition of 
assessments against government property. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.01, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-102. - Proceedings. 
(a) ?The proceedings for the imposition of an assessment shall include a public hearing noticed in the 
manner set forth in section 34-104 hereof, and the adoption at or anytime thereafter of an annual 
assessment resolution which shall: 
(1) ?Contain a brief and general description of the fire protection services, facilities or programs to 
be provided or made available; 
(2) ?Describe the method or methods of apportioning the fire service assessed cost among affected 
tax parcels; 
(3) ?Describe the tax parcels, if any, to be exempted from the fire service assessment for legal or 
public policy purposes; 
(4) ?Identify the rate or rates of assessment and approve and adopt the annual assessment roll, 
consistent with the requirements of section 34-103 hereof; and 
(5) ?Determine the method of collecting the fire service assessment. 
(b) ?So long as the development and articulation of any method of apportionment, rates of assessment, 
the assessment roll or methods of notice have been reasonably undertaken and otherwise 
promulgated to the public in accordance with the time periods and provisions hereof, the annual 
assessment resolution may be adopted at the same meeting of the city commission, or at any 
subsequent meeting of the city commission, immediately after adoption of this article, or any 
amendment hereto. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.02, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-103. - Assessment roll. 
(a) ?The assessment coordinator shall prepare, or direct the preparation of, the assessment roll, which 
shall contain the following: 
(1) ?A summary description of all assessed property by tax parcel conforming to the description 
contained on the tax roll. 
(2) ?The name of the owner of the assessed property. 
(3) ?The extension or application of the rates of the proposed assessment to be imposed against 
each such tax parcel of assessed property. 
(b) ?The assessment roll shall be retained by the assessment coordinator and shall be open to public 
inspection. The foregoing shall not be construed to require that the assessment roll be in printed 
form if the amount of the assessment for each tax parcel of property can be determined by use of the 
internet, a computer terminal available to the public or similar technology available to the public. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.03, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-104. - Notice. 
    At least 20 days prior to the public hearing, the city shall notice the public hearing by publication in a 
newspaper generally circulated within the boundaries of the city. The notice shall provide the date, time 
and place of the hearing. The notice shall contain a general statement that the city commission will 
consider imposing a special assessment throughout the city on the various parcels of property within the 
city to fund all or a portion of the cost to continually be available and stand ready to provide fire protection 
services, facilities and programs, the proposed rates or explanation of the schedule of assessments and 
include general information pertaining to the proposed apportionment methodology, the method of 
collection and a statement that all affected property owners have a right to appear at the public hearing 
and the right to file written objections within 20 days of the publication of the notice. The notice shall direct 
all interested persons to the assessment roll and information concerning the amount of the proposed 
assessment applicable to each parcel of property; provided, however, that such assessment roll need not 
be in printed form if the amount of the assessment for each parcel of property can be determined by use 
of the internet, a computer terminal available to the public, or similar technology available to the public. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.04, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-105. - Annual assessment resolution. 
    At the time named in such notice, or to which an adjournment or continuance may be taken by the 
city commission, the city commission shall receive any written comments or objections of interested 
persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the city commission, adopt the annual 
assessment resolution which shall: 
(1) ?Establish the rate or rates of assessment to be imposed in the designated fiscal year; 
(2) ?Approve and adopt the assessment roll, with such amendments and directions as it deems just 
and right; and 
(3) ?Provide direction as to the method of collection. 
    All parcels assessed shall derive a special benefit from the fire protection services, facilities, or 
programs to be provided or constructed and the assessment shall be fairly and reasonably apportioned 
between the properties that receive the special benefit. All objections to the annual assessment resolution 
shall be made in writing, and filed with the assessment coordinator at or before the time or adjourned time 
of such hearing. The annual assessment resolution as confirmed shall constitute the final action 
necessary annually to impose or re-impose assessments hereunder. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.05, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-106. - Effect of annual assessment resolution. 
    The assessments for the initial fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year shall be established upon 
adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution. The adoption and confirmation of the 
annual assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not 
limited to, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate or rates of assessment, the 
assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a 
court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the city commission action 
adopting and confirming on the annual assessment resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by 
the annual assessment resolution, shall be delivered for collection using the traditional direct billing 
method of collection described in section 34-122 hereof to collect the assessments, or such other method 
as the city commission by resolution shall designate. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.06, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-107. - Adoption of subsequent annual assessment resolutions. 
    The city commission may adopt subsequent annual assessment resolutions as a part of and during 
its budget adoption process for each fiscal year following the initial fiscal year for which an assessment is 
imposed hereunder. The annual assessment resolution shall approve the assessment roll for the 
upcoming fiscal year. The assessment roll may be prepared in accordance with the methods of 
apportionment set forth in the prior assessment resolution but may include modifications as a matter of 
policy as to what, if any, portion or portions of the city's budget is paid for from legally available funds 
other than assessment revenues. Failure to adopt an annual assessment resolution during the budget 
adoption process may be cured at any time. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.07, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-108. - Alternative use of uniform assessment collection act. 
(a) ?The city may determine to use the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act; provided, however, that all of the extraordinary procedures required by 
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act can be and are timely complied with. 
(b) ?In the event the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act 
is determined to be used, the assessment coordinator shall publish notice which shall conform to the 
requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and, in addition to the requirements 
set forth in this article, the assessment coordinator shall provide notice of the proposed assessment 
by first class mail to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment which shall 
conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Such mailed notice 
may be provided by including the assessment in the property appraiser's notice of proposed property 
taxes and proposed or adopted non-ad valorem assessments under F.S. § 200.069, or its successor 
in function. The assessment coordinator may provide proof of such notice by affidavit. Failure of the 
owner to receive notice due to mistake or inadvertence shall nevertheless not affect the validity of 
the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed 
by the city commission pursuant to this article. 
(c) ?The city commission may also establish by resolution or directive such reasonable procedures or 
directions to confirm and comply with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as may be practicable 
and necessary. 
(d) ?Nothing herein shall preclude the city commission from establishing by resolution a maximum rate of 
assessment provided that notice of such maximum assessment rate is provided pursuant to the 
Uniform Assessment Collection Act. In the event that the uniform method of collection provided for in 
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act is used and (1) the proposed assessment for any fiscal year 
exceeds the maximum rate of assessment adopted by the city commission and included in notice 
previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform Assessment 
Collection Act, (2) the method of apportionment is changed or the purpose for which the assessment 
is imposed is substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to the 
owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (3) assessed 
property is reclassified in a manner which results in an increased assessment from that represented 
by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act, or (4) an assessment roll contains assessed property that was not 
included on the assessment roll approved for the prior fiscal year, notice and opportunity to be heard 
shall be provided to the owners of such assessed property. Such notice shall substantially conform 
to the notice requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and inform the owner 
of the time, date and place for adoption of the annual assessment resolution. The failure of the 
owner to receive such notice due to mistake or inadvertence shall not affect the validity of the 
assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by 
the city commission pursuant to this article. 
(e) ?The assessment roll, as approved by the annual assessment resolution, shall be certified and 
delivered to the tax collector as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.08, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-109. - Lien of fire service assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all assessments shall constitute a lien against such 
property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special 
assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, until paid such lien shall be superior in dignity to all 
other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims. The lien for an assessment shall be deemed perfected 
upon adoption by the city commission of the annual assessment resolution. The lien for an assessment 
collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Method shall attach to the property included on the 
assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. 
The lien for an assessment collected under the traditional method of collection provided in section 34-122 
hereof shall be deemed perfected upon adoption and confirmation by the city commission of the annual 
assessment resolution, after a public hearing, and shall attach to the property on such date of each such 
annual assessment resolution. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.09, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-110. - Revisions to fire service assessments. 
    If any assessment made under the provisions of this article is either in whole or in part annulled, 
vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city commission is satisfied that any such 
assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city 
commission has omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so 
included, the city commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new assessment against any 
property benefited by the fire service assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the 
provisions of this article and in case such second assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city 
commission may obtain and impose other assessments until a valid assessment is imposed. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.10, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-111. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any assessment under 
the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any 
assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such assessment was 
duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to 
such assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this article; and no variance from 
the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was 
materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any party objecting to an 
assessment imposed pursuant to this article must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction 
within the time periods prescribed herein. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.11, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-112. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a) ?No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, assessment 
coordinator, city commission, or their deputies, employees, or agents shall operate to release or 
discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by the city commission under the 
provision of this article. 
(b) ?When it shall appear that any assessment should have been imposed under this article against a 
parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire protection services, facilities, or 
programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll, the city commission may, 
upon provision of notice to the owner by first class mail, impose the applicable assessment for the 
fiscal year in which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable assessment due for the 
prior two fiscal years. Such total assessment shall become delinquent if not fully paid upon the 
expiration of 60 days from the date of the adoption of said resolution. The assessment so imposed 
shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, 
county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all 
other prior liens, mortgages, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and may 
be collected as provided in division 3 hereof. 
(c) ?The assessment coordinator shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in 
response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to an assessment, based 
upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, to correct any error in annually applying 
the assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring 
the provision of mailed notice pursuant to this article or the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
Additionally, because the size and nature of the tax roll may yield anomalies, the assessment 
coordinator is authorized to apply sound public administration judgment and delete or remove 
individual tax parcels from the assessment roll that due to specific circumstances do not receive a 
special benefit, are not developable (e.g. subsurface rights, submerged, slivers, right-of-way, 
common elements) or are reasonably determined to be inappropriate, infeasible or impracticable to 
assess, and do not merit the expenditure of public funds and resources to impose or collect such 
assessments. Unless the assessment coordinator determines that a tax parcel otherwise does 
receive benefit, for any tax parcel with a just value of less than $5,000.00 (as determined solely by 
the property appraiser), such value may be used as a prima facie determination that the tax parcel 
need not be included on the assessment roll. Any such corrections shall be considered valid ab initio 
and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the assessment imposed under the provisions of this 
article. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections 
shall be referred to, and processed by, the assessment coordinator and not the property appraiser or 
tax collector. 
(d) ?After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in 
accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon 
timely written request and direction of the assessment coordinator. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 2.12, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-113. - Interim assessments. 
(a) ?An interim assessment may be imposed against all property for which a certificate of occupancy is 
issued after adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution. The amount of the 
interim assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth of the annual 
rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual assessment resolution for the fiscal 
year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full 
calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim assessment 
shall also include an estimate of the subsequent year's assessment. If the commission determines to 
impose an interim assessment, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until full payment of the 
interim assessment is received by the city. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy by mistake or 
inadvertence, and without the payment in full of the interim assessment, shall not relieve the owner 
of such property of the obligation of full payment. For the purpose of this provision, such interim 
assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy was issued 
and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and 
dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and 
superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the 
real property involved. 
(b) ?Exclusive of property for which an interim assessment was paid pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, 
an interim assessment may also be imposed against any property which for any reason was omitted 
from the fire service assessment roll or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual tax parcel as of 
the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual assessment resolution for any 
upcoming fiscal year. For the purpose of this provision, such interim assessment shall be deemed 
due and payable and shall constitute a lien against such property for which it is imposed. Said lien 
shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and 
special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and 
claims in and to or against the real property involved.

Sec. 34-114. - Administrative hardship deferment. 
(a) ?Annually upon application of the owner of a tax parcel subject to the assessments contemplated 
herein, the assessment coordinator may grant a hardship deferment, in which case the tax parcel in 
question will receive a deferral. The owner shall be required to execute a binding agreement 
encumbering the tax parcel and otherwise assure the city that payment in full of the assessment and 
any recording cost, plus interest at an estimated cost of city funds compounded annually, shall be 
due over a period of time or upon sale or transfer of the property. Such agreement or a 
memorandum thereof shall be recorded in the official records of Putnam County, Florida. Dependent 
upon the volume or demand for such deferment, the city commission may determine to release such 
deferments in the future. However, all funding for such hardship deferment, or the consequences of 
the deferment or any future release, shall be from legally available funds other than direct proceeds 
of other assessments. The assessment coordinator is authorized to use sound public administration 
judgment in applying this authority and considering such applications. 
(b) ?This provision serves to promote a public purpose and the general welfare, morals and contentment 
of the inhabitants and residents of the city.

DIVISION 3. - COLLECTION OF FIRE SERVICE ASSESSMENTS 


Sec. 34-121. - Collection. 
(a) ?The process of collection is driven by many equitable, practical and economic factors. The 
traditional direct billing method is initially far less expensive and provides fair and adequate notice 
and opportunity to be heard through publication in a newspaper of general circulation. The uniform 
method of collection additionally provides extraordinary notice by individual mailing, but such notice 
is many times more expensive than published notice. The individually mailed notice required by the 
Uniform Assessment Collection Act is extraordinary and unique to collection of an assessment 
occurring along with and included on the same bill as for ad valorem taxes. 
(b) ?Unless otherwise directed by the city commission, the assessments shall be collected pursuant to 
the traditional direct billing method provided in section 34-122 hereof. Any hearing or notice required 
by this article may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by this article or the 
Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 3.01, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-122. - Traditional method of collection. 
    The city may elect to collect the assessments by any other method which is authorized by law or 
provided by this section as follows: 
(1) ?The city shall provide assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel 
of property, other than government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material 
shall include: 
a. ?A brief explanation of the assessment; 
b. ?A description of the unit of measurement or method used to determine the amount of the 
assessment; 
c. ?The number of units contained within the tax parcel; 
d. ?The rate or rates applied to the units of measurement or method and the total amount of 
the assessment imposed against the tax parcel for the appropriate period; 
e. ?The location at which payment will be accepted; 
f. ?The date on which the assessment is due; and 
g. ?A statement that the assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank 
and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad 
valorem assessments. 
(2) ?A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the assessments throughout the city 
may be recorded in the official records of the county. Nothing herein shall be construed to 
require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(3) ?The city shall have the right to appoint or retain an agent to foreclose and collect all delinquent 
assessments in the manner provided by law. 
(4) ?An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any 
installment is due. The city or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in 
payment of his or her assessment within 90 days from the date such assessment was due. 
Such notice shall state in effect that the city or its agent may either: 
a. ?Initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property 
subject to a delinquent assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for 
foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or 
b. ?Cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent assessment, not previously subject to 
collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be 
collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(5) ?All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, 
related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or 
decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the 
purchaser to the same extent as an individual person or corporation. The city may join in one 
foreclosure action the collection of assessments against any or all property assessed in 
accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall 
be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and 
its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and 
any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments and the same 
shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(6) ?In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent assessment and the costs, fees and expenses otherwise 
reasonably attributable thereto, may be collected subsequently pursuant to the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that: 
a. ?Notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment 
Collection Act and this article; and 
b. ?Any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent assessment is 
supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to 
the tax collector. 
(7) ?Any city commission action required in the collection of assessments may be by resolution. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 3.02, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-123. - Uniform method of collection. 
(a) ?In lieu of utilizing any other method of collection available to the city, the city may elect to collect 
assessments using the uniform method pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; and, for 
any specific parcel of benefitted property may include an amount equivalent to the payment 
delinquency, delinquency fees and expenses and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a 
comparable service, facility, or program provided: 
(1) ?The collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the 
use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; 
(2) ?Notice is provided to the owner; and 
(3) ?Any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to 
such assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by the city. 
(b) ?If the city commission determines the assessments are to be collected on the same bill as for ad 
valorem taxes, then the assessment coordinator shall comply and conform to the extraordinary 
requirements of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
( Ord. No. 15-14 , § 3.03, 8-6-2015) 


Sec. 34-124. - Government property. 
(a) ?To the extent permitted by law, the city reserves the right to impose a charge or fee comparable in 
amount to assessments on governmental property. As used in this section, the context of the term 
"assessment" shall refer to such a charge or fee. If assessments are imposed against government 
property, the city shall provide assessment bills by first class mail to the owner or agent of each 
affected parcel of government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
(1) ?A brief explanation of the assessment; 
(2) ?A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the assessment; 
(3) ?The number of units contained within the tax parcel; 
(4) ?The rate or rates applicable to the units of measurement or method and the total amount of the 
assessment imposed against the tax parcel for the appropriate period; 
(5) ?The location at which payment will be accepted; and 
(6) ?The date on which the assessment is due. 
(b) ?Assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as all other 
assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment. 
(c) ?An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any installment 
is due. The city shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its 
assessment within 90 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state that the 
city will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(d) ?All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related 
to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree 
rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other 
appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and 
expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent 
assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments 
and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(e) ?As an alternative to the foregoing, an assessment imposed against government property may be 
collected as a surcharge on a utility bill provided to such government property in 12 installments with 
a remedy of a mandamus action in the event of non-payment. The city commission may also 
contract for such billing services with any utility not otherwise owned by the city.

reserve account deposits. 
(b) ?The principal of and interest on each series of obligations shall be payable from pledged revenue. 
The city commission may agree, by ordinance or resolution, to budget and appropriate funds to

the obligations, from other non-ad valorem revenue sources. The city commission may also provide, 
by ordinance or resolution, for a pledge of or lien upon proceeds of such non-ad valorem revenue 
sources for the benefit of the holders of the obligations. Any such ordinance or resolution shall 
determine the nature and extent of any pledge of or lien upon proceeds of such non-ad valorem 
revenue sources.

    The obligations shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such times as 
may be determined by ordinance or resolution of the city commission, and may be made redeemable 
before maturity, at the option of the city, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, all 
as may be fixed by the city commission. Said obligations shall mature not later than 40 years after their

manner of executing such obligations, and shall fix the denominations of such obligations, the place or 
places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or 
outside of the State of Florida, and such other terms and provisions of the obligations as it deems 
appropriate. The obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the city 
commission shall determine by ordinance or resolution. The obligations may be delivered to any

    Obligations issued under the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute a general 
obligation or pledge of the full faith and credit of the city within the meaning of the Constitution of the 
State of Florida, but such obligations shall be payable only from pledged revenue and, if applicable, 
proceeds of the assessments, in the manner provided herein and by the ordinance or resolution 
authorizing the obligations. The issuance of obligations under the provisions of this article shall not 
directly or indirectly obligate the city to levy or to pledge any form of ad valorem taxation whatsoever. No 
holder of any such obligations shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the ad valorem taxing 
power on the part of the city to pay any such obligations or the interest thereon or to enforce payment of 
such obligations or the interest thereon against any property of the city, nor shall such obligations 
constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the city, except the 
pledged revenue.

Sec. 38-1. - Title. 
    These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the City of Palatka, 
hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 12-19, § 1(Exh. 1), 3-22-2012) 


Sec. 38-2. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within 
any flood hazard area, including, but not limited to, the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site 
improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, 
replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from 
the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and 
manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles;

Sec. 38-3. - Intent. 
    The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the 
Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and 
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of 
development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1) ?Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of 
flooding; 
(2) ?Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future 
flood damage; 
(3) ?Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of 
equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion 
potential; 
(4) ?Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the 
impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5) ?Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6) ?Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood 
hazard areas; 
(7) ?Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response 
to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8) ?Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as 
set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(Ord. No. 12-19, § 1(Exh. 1), 3-22-2012) 


Sec. 38-4. - Coordination with the Florida Building Code. 
    This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building 
Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida 
Building Code. 
(Ord. No. 12-19, § 1(Exh. 1), 3-22-2012; Ord. No. 17-22, § 2, 9-28-2017 ) 


Sec. 38-5. - Disclaimer. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida Building Code, as amended 
by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on 
scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be 
increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped 
special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from 
flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Palatka City Commission 
or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or 
any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations 
contained in the flood insurance study and shown on the flood insurance rate maps and the requirements 
of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for 
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future 
use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance.

Sec. 38-19. - Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. 
    The flood insurance study for Putnam County, Florida dated February 2, 2012, and all subsequent 
amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all subsequent 
amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this chapter and shall 
serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood 
hazard areas are on file at the City of Palatka Building and Zoning Department office, 205 North Second 
Street, Palatka, Florida. 
(Ord. No. 12-19, § 1(Exh. 1), 3-22-2012) 


Sec. 38-20. - Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. 
    To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to article I, division 6 of this 
ordinance the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed 
topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the 
community indicates that ground elevations: 
(1) ?Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special 
flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to 
the requirements of this chapter and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building 
Code. 
(2) ?Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special 
flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area 
from the special flood hazard area.

Sec. 38-22. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This chapter supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard 
areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including, but not limited 
to, land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida 
Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any other ordinance, the more 
restrictive shall govern. This chapter shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any 
land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this chapter.

characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any 
provision of this chapter or the required elevation standards; 
(2) ?Determination by the zoning board of appeals that: 
a. ?Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical 
characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the 
requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b. ?The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to 
public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or 
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c. ?The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3) ?Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded 
in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the 
affected parcel of land; and 
(4) ?If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a building, or 
substantial improvement of a building, below the elevation, a copy in the record of a written 
notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the 
difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, 
stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk 
resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of 
insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases 
risks to life and property.

or implied, of response. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to 
respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained.

Sec. 46-134. - Findings; intent of division. 
    In addition and supplemental to the findings and determinations contained in the "whereas" 
provisions of Ordinance No. 94-11, which are incorporated by reference into this section, it is hereby 
found by the city commission, acting in its legislative capacity for the purpose of regulating the conduct of 
appearing nude in public places and for the purpose of regulating nudity and other conduct in 
establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages, that, considering what has happened in other 
communities, the acts prohibited in section 46-137 encourage or create the potential for the conduct of 
prostitution, attempted rape, rape and assault in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic 
beverages; that actual and simulated nudity and sexual conduct, coupled with the consumption of 
alcoholic beverages in public places, begets and has the potential for begetting undesirable and unlawful 
behavior; and that sexual, lewd, lascivious and salacious conduct among patrons and employees within 
establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages results in violation of law and creates dangers in the 
health, safety, morals and welfare of the public and those who engage in such conduct. It is the intent of 
section 46-137 to specifically prohibit nudity, gross sexuality and the simulation thereof in establishments

    Synthetic cannabinoids means any herbal, vegetal or liquid material which has been soaked, 
sprayed, blended, combined or otherwise enhanced with a synthetic chemical or synthetic chemical 
compound that enables the herbal, vegetal or liquid material, or the smoke or vapor emitted from its 
burning, or vaporization, to mimic or simulate the effects of a controlled substance, tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC), when inhaled, ingested, or otherwise introduced into the human body or otherwise affects the 
function of the human body. Any herbal, vegetal or liquid material described above shall be considered a 
synthetic cannabinoid regardless of the labeling posted on the packaging for the material and regardless 
of whether the labeling states that its contents are "not for human consumption," "not for smoking," or 
other similar statement. The fact that a herbal, vegetal or liquid material, packaged and advertised as a 
food additive, potpourri, herbal incense, etc., has been soaked, sprayed, blended, combined or otherwise 
enhanced with a synthetic chemical or synthetic chemical compound which has no legitimate relation to 
the advertised use of the product may be considered in determining whether the product is considered a 
synthetic cannabinoid. This term specifically does not include any herbal, vegetal or liquid material 
containing synthetic chemicals or chemical compounds which: (1) require a prescription; (2) are approved 
by the United States Food and Drug Administration; and (3) are dispensed in accordance with Florida and 
federal law.

the effects of a narcotic or other controlled substance when inhaled, ingested, injected or otherwise 
introduced into the human body or otherwise affects the function of the human body. Any material 
described above shall be considered a synthetic drug regardless of the labeling posted on the packaging 
for the material and regardless of whether the labeling states that its contents are "not for human 
consumption," "not for smoking," or contains some other similar statement. Material packaged and 
advertised as a cleaning agent, food additive, therapeutic bath crystals, plant food, insect repellant, etc. 
is, in fact, a synthetic chemical or synthetic chemical compound which has no legitimate relation to the 
advertised use of the product and is considered a synthetic drug. This term specifically does not include 
any legitimate, traditional materials known as bath salts or Epsom salts containing synthetic chemicals or 
chemical compounds which may: (1) require a prescription; (2) are approved by the United States Food 
and Drug Administration; and (3) are dispensed in accordance with Florida and federal law. 
    Synthetic chemical or synthetic chemical compound refers to a chemical or chemical compound 
whose molecular composition is similar to, or mimics any of those substances listed as controlled 
substances in F.S. ch. 893, and whose intended use when introduced into the human body is to mimic 
the effects of a controlled substance. "Substantially similar chemical structure" of a controlled substance 
is described in F.S. § 893.0356.

whether a product, substance, or other material should be classified as a synthetic drug. For the purposes 
of enforcement pursuant to section 46-286, the establishment of two or more of these factors shall 
constitute prima facie evidence that the product is a synthetic drug. 
(1) ?Marketing. A product routinely advertised to be a substance for which it is rarely, if ever,

normally found on such products. The warnings may be similar, but not limited to, "not for 
human consumption," "not for purchase by minors," etc. 
b. ?Products containing notices on the package not normally found on similar products such 
as, but not limited to, "does not contain any chemical compounds prohibited by State law," 
"contains no prohibited chemicals," "product is in accordance with State and Federal laws,"

any DEA banned substance," "legal herbal substance," "aromatherapy only," "legal in 50 
states," "100% compliant guaranteed," etc.

euphoria, relaxation, mood enhancement, or that the product has other drug-like effects on 
the body or otherwise affects the function of the human body. 
d. ?Products using brand names and packaging designed to make the product appear similar 
to illicit street drugs or commonly used street slang for illicit drugs or their effects or 
employs symbols, terms or effects of illegal drugs, such as marijuana leaf, blunts, red eyes 
or crossed-out eyes. 
e. ?Packages are misleading, deceptive or misbranded, including but not limited to (1) the label 
is in any way false or misleading; (2) the label does not bear the name and place of 
business of the manufacturer, repackager, or distributor of the finished form of the drug; (3) 
the label does not bear adequate directions for use; or (4) the label does not bear 
adequate warnings against use and/or the product contains contradictory 
warnings/directions for the product's use, which is not consistent for the type of product 
advertised. (Example: "For fragrance or aromatherapy only" which requires human 
inhalation and/or "blueberry flavor" upon packages that also read "not for human 
consumption" or similar statements.) 
(4) ?Price. The price of the synthetic drug product is incongruent with other products marketed in 
the city for legitimate use as incense, plant food, etc. 
(5) ?Similarity to illicit street drugs. Products designed to make the substance appear similar to illicit 
street drugs (examples: a white powder made to resemble, in color and texture, cocaine, or 
dried vegetal material resembling marijuana). 
(6) ?Ingredients. A product which is, or has been enhanced with, a synthetic chemical or synthetic 
chemical compound that has no legitimate relation to the advertised use of the product but 
mimics the effects of a controlled substance when the product, or the smoke or vapor from the 
burned or vaporized product, is introduced into the human body. 
(7) ?Verbal or written representations. Verbal or written representations made at the place of sale or 
display regarding the purpose, methods, use, or effect of the product on the human body.

(a) ?The structures within the city provide visual evidence of the city's significant role in the economic, 
political and architectural development of northeast Florida, wherein the city for a substantial period 
in the 19th and 20th centuries occupied a prominent place in a regional tourist and industrial 
economy. The city has provided the state with political, economic and social leadership, whose 
values and position is reflected in the structures its members sponsored. The historic districts and 
sites of the city represent in the homogeneity of their architectural forms the city's legacy of 
prominence and possess a distinctiveness of character in the visual interrelationship and congruity of 
their separate elements, the maintenance of each of which is vital to all. 
(b) ?In recognition of the importance of the city's heritage: 
(1) ?It is hereby declared as a matter of public policy that the protection, enhancement and 
perpetuation of properties of historic, cultural and aesthetic merit are in the interest of the 
health, morals, prosperity and general welfare of the people of the city. Therefore, the purpose 
of this article is to: 
a. ?Effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of districts, structures 
and sites which represent distinctive elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, 
political and architectural history; 
b. ?Foster civic pride in the accomplishments of the past; 
c. ?Enhance the city's appeal to visitors and thereby support and stimulate the economy; 
d. ?Protect and enhance property values as a means of stabilizing historic districts and sites of 
the city; and 
e. ?Promote the use of historic districts and sites for the education, pleasure and welfare of the 
people of the city. 
(2) ?It is further declared that the purposes of this article are to: 
a. ?Retain and enhance those properties which contribute to the character of the historic 
districts and to encourage their adaptation for current use and to ensure that alterations of 
existing structures are compatible with the character of the historic districts; and 
b. ?Ensure that new construction and subdivision of lots in historic districts are compatible with 
the character of the historic districts.

Sec. 54-78. - Certificate of appropriateness required; procedure for issuance. 
(a) ?Submission of plans. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required to erect, construct or alter a 
structure or sign located or to be located in a historic district. Every application for a certificate of 
appropriateness shall be accompanied by plans for the proposed work. As used in this section, the 
term "plans" shall mean drawings or sketches with sufficient detail to show interior and exterior 
architectural design of the structure or sign (both before and after the proposed work is done in the 
cases of altering, repairing or demolishing a structure), including proposed materials, textures and 
colors, and the plat plan or site layout, including all site improvements or features such as walls, 
walks, terraces, paintings, accessory structures, signs, lights, awnings, canopies and other 
appurtenances. Such plans shall be promptly forwarded by the building official to the board. 
(b) ?Review of plans; action by board. The board shall hold a public hearing at its regularly scheduled

certificate of appropriateness on or before 60 days from the date that plans are submitted by the 
building official to the board. 
(c) ?Notification of decision; issuance of building permit. 
(1) ?Upon receiving the order of the board, the secretary of the board shall thereupon notify the 
applicant and the building official of the decision of the board. If the board shall have approved 
the plans, and has issued a certificate of appropriateness, and if all other requirements of the 
city have been met, the building official may issue a permit for the proposed structure or sign. If 
the board shall have disapproved the plans, the building official shall not issue such permit. 
(2) ?In a case where the board has disapproved the plans, and denied a certificate of 
appropriateness, the secretary of the board shall furnish the applicant and the building official 
with a copy of the board's written order, together with a copy of any recommendations for 
changes necessary to be made before the board will reconsider the plans. 
(d) ?Failure of board to review plans. If no action upon the plans submitted to the board by the building 
official has been taken upon the expiration of 60 days from the time specified in subsection (b) of this 
section such plans shall be deemed to have been approved and such applicant shall receive a 
certificate of appropriateness. If all other applicable requirements of the city have been met, the 
building official may issue the permit. 
(e) ?Notice of public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be given at least ten days in advance of 
the public hearing. The owner of the property for which the conditional use is sought, or his agent or 
attorney designated by him in his petition, shall be notified by mail. Notice of the public hearing shall 
be prominently posted on the property for which the conditional use is sought. Notice shall be given 
by mail to all owners of property within 150 feet of the boundary lines of the property for which the 
conditional use is requested; provided, however, that where the applicant is the owner of land not 
included in the applicant's application and such land that is not included in the application is a part of 
or adjoins the parcel for which the request is made, the 150-foot requirement shall be measured from 
the boundaries of the applicant's ownership, including the land not covered by applicant's 
application. For purposes of this subsection, owners of adjacent or nearby properties within the 
distance set out shall be deemed those whose names appear on the latest available tax rolls of the 
city. Failure of a property owner to receive mail notice shall not invalidate the hearing or subsequent 
action related thereto. 
(f) ?Ordinary maintenance exemption. A certificate of appropriate is not required for ordinary 
maintenance when a building permit is not required and the work is done to repair damage or 
prevent deterioration of a structure by restoring it as nearly practical to its condition prior to the 
damage. 
(g) ?Staff approval. Staff may approve actions that do not constitute ordinary maintenance but do not 
alter original historic features. Staff may also approve actions that resemble features that were 
originally on a structure or were likely to have been on such a structure, according to documented 
descriptions or photos of the structure in question or similar structures and also according to 
documented descriptions of a particular historic architectural style or building practice. 
(Ord. No. 12-31, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-12-2012; Ord. No. 13-32, § 1, 7-11-2013) 


Sec. 54-79. - Criteria for decisions on certificate of appropriateness. 
(a) ?General considerations. In reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the board 
shall consider the design and appearance of the structure, including the interior, front, sides, rear 
and roof; materials, textures and colors; and plot plan or site layout, including features such as walls, 
walks, terraces, plantings, accessory structures, signs, lights, awnings, canopies and other 
appurtenances. The decision to issue or not to issue the certificate shall be based on the 
conformance of the proposed work to the secretary of the interior's standards for rehabilitation. When 
reviewing a certificate of appropriateness for relocation of a structure, consideration will be given to 
the immediate surroundings and to the district in which it is located or to be located. The board shall 
not exercise any control over land use, such as is governed by the zoning ordinance, or over 
construction, such as is governed by the building code, unless such control is within the intent and 
scope of this article. 
(b) ?Specific rules governing decisions. Before approving the plans for any proposed structure or signs 
located or to be located in a district, the board shall find: 
(1) ?In the case of a proposed alteration or addition to an existing structure, that such alteration or 
addition will not materially impair the architectural or historic value of the structure. 
(2) ?In the case of a proposed new structure, that such structure will not, in itself or by reason of its 
location on the site, materially impair the architectural or historic value of a structure on adjacent 
sites or in the immediate vicinity. 
(3) ?In the case of a proposed new structure, that such structure will not be injurious to the general 
visual character of the district in which it is to be located. 
(4) ?In the case of the proposed demolition of an existing structure, that the removal of such 
structure will not be detrimental to the historic and architectural character of the district, or that, 
balancing the interest of the city in preserving the integrity of the district and the interest of the 
owner of the property, approval of the plans for demolition is required by considerations of 
reasonable justice and equity; in the latter event the board shall issue an order postponing 
demolition for a period of not to exceed three months. If the board concludes that the demolition 
should be postponed, it shall, before issuing any final order with respect to such postponement, 
afford the applicant an opportunity to appear before the board to offer any evidence he may 
desire to present concerning the proposed order. Within the period of postponement, the board 
shall consult with the Putnam County Historical Society board of directors and others to 
ascertain what the city or other agency or organization may do to preserve such structure and 
shall make recommendations to that effect to the city commission or otherwise cause the 
structure to be preserved. This article shall not apply to any permit for demolition which had 
been applied for, in proper form, prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this 
article is derived. 
(5) ?In the case of any proposed new or altered sign, that the sign will not materially impair the 
architectural or historic value of any structure to which it is attached, or any adjacent structure, 
and that such sign is consistent with the following provisions: 
a. ?Within the district, signs protruding into or overhanging the public right-of-way are permitted 
subject to removal on 30 days' notice if the city actually requires the space for any public 
purpose. Such signs must be of a character and size consistent with maintenance of the 
district. Existing overhanging signs are hereby approved and will not require further board 
approval. 
b. ?Rooftop signs are prohibited. Provided the business for which the sign is erected continues 
to function, existing signs violating this provision may continue in use for a period of five 
years. Upon application to and approval by the board, such existing signs may be 
permitted to remain in place for a longer period if the board finds that the sign is consistent 
with the district. 
c. ?Whirling or flashing signs are prohibited, but may be installed as special exceptions, after 
application to and approval of the board, if the board finds that such sign is consistent with 
the block where it is to be erected. Existing whirling or flashing signs shall be subject to the 
same rules as are set out in this section for rooftop signs. 
d. ?On application to and approval of the board, rules relating to the number and size of signs 
may be waived for grand openings, special sales, seasonal promotions, going out of 
business sales and similar occasions. 
(c) ?Form of decision. Every decision of the board, in passing upon plans for structures or signs located 
or to be located in the district, shall be in the form of a written order stating the findings of the board, 
its decision and the reasons therefor. 
(d) ?Recommendations for changes in plans. The board shall not disapprove any plans without giving its 
recommendations for changes necessary to be made before the plans will be reconsidered. Such 
recommendations may be general in scope, and compliance with them shall qualify the plans for 
reconsideration by the board. 
(Ord. No. 12-31, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-12-2012) 


Sec. 54-80. - Proper maintenance of structures required. 
    Neither the owner of, nor the person in charge of, a structure within a historic district shall permit 
such structure to fall into a state of disrepair which may result in the deterioration of exterior 
appurtenances or architectural features so as to produce or tend to produce, in the judgment of the board, 
a detrimental effect upon the character of the district as a whole or the life and character of the structure 
in question. 
(Ord. No. 12-31, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-12-2012)

Sec. 54-113. - Legislative findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined and declared: 
(a) ?Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2(b), Florida Constitution, and sections F.S. §§ 166.021 and 
166.041, the city commission of the City of Palatka has all powers of local self-government to 
perform municipal functions and render municipal services and facilities except when prohibited 
by law, and such power may be exercised by the enactment of legislation in the form of city 
ordinances. 
(b) ?Future growth, as represented by capital facilities impact construction, should contribute its fair 
share to the cost of improvements and additions to the capital facilities that are required to 
accommodate the impact generated by such growth. 
(c) ?Implementation of impact fees to require future capital facilities impact construction to 
contribute its fair share of the cost of required improvements and additions to capital facilities is 
an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management incorporated in the 
comprehensive plan of the city. 
(d) ?The required improvements and additions to the capital facilities needed to eliminate any 
deficiencies shall be financed by revenue sources of the city other than impact fees. 
(e) ?[Reserved.] 
(f) ?Based upon the studies entitled "City of Palatka Parks and Recreation Facilities Impact Fee 
Study" prepared by Government Services Group, Inc. dated May, 2007, "City of Palatka Fire 
Rescue Impact Fee Study" prepared by Government Services Group, Inc. dated May, 2007, 
"City of Palatka Transportation Impact Fee Study" prepared by Government Services Group, 
Inc. and ARCADIS dated May, 2007, "City of Palatka Law Enforcement Impact Fee Study" 
prepared by Government Services Group, Inc. dated November, 2006, and "City of Palatka, 
Florida, Water and Wastewater Impact Fee Study" prepared by Public Resources Management 
Group, Inc. dated February, 2007, the city commission now desires to adopt a comprehensive 
impact fee ordinance, including provisions for the imposition of park impact fees, fire rescue 
impact fees, road impact fees, law enforcement impact fees, water impact fees and sewer 
impact fees. 
(g) ?The data set forth in the impact fee studies, which was employed in the calculation of the 
impact fee rates to be imposed in conformance with this article, is the most recent and localized 
data available for the applicable capital facilities as of the date of each impact fee study. 
(h) ?This article shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees from capital facilities 
impact construction in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the need for and 
demand on those capital facilities generated by such capital facilities impact construction. 
(i) ?The commission has determined that the adoption of a comprehensive impact fee ordinance 
and the implementation of impact fees for parks and recreational facilities, fire rescue, roads, 
law enforcement, water and sewer is in the best interests of the citizens of the City of Palatka, 
Florida. 
(j) ?The 2008 economic downturn resulted in increased foreclosures, business closings and a 
decline in new construction projects within the city. A decline in construction projects within the 
city impacts all local industries that are dependent upon growth, such as construction, 
manufacturing and real estate. A decrease in the number of building permits issued by the city 
also adversely impacts the city's budget growth of the city's tax base is dependent upon new 
construction, redevelopment and increasing property values. In this economic climate the 
collection of parks and recreation, fire rescue, roads and law enforcement impact fees, as 
established pursuant to this ordinance, may place the city in a non-competitive position with 
other local governments that have chosen not to require growth to pay its fair share of needed 
capital facilities and thus hinder efforts by the city and the community to encourage economic 
development opportunities within the city, to preserve and create permanent employment 
expansion opportunities for the city's citizens, and expand the city's tax base. Therefore the city 
commission wishes to continue the 2008 Economic Recovery and Incentive Program, as 
created by Ordinance No. 08-20, adopted on December, 18, 2008, and extended by Ordinance 
11-07 adopted April 14, 2011, through December 31, 2013, extended again by Ordinance No. 
2014-01 adopted January 9, 2014, through May 31, 2014, and extended again by Ordinance 
No. 2014-12 adopted May 24, 2014, through December 31, 2015, and extended again by 
Ordinance No. 2016-01 adopted January 28, 2016, through December 31, 2017, providing for 
suspension of the city's parks and recreation, fire rescue, roads and law enforcement impact 
fees for a period not to exceed two years (24 months) in order to allow time for the local 
economy to recover and to stimulate local development, preserve jobs in the construction 
industry and expand the city's tax base.

impact construction is less than the new net trips that are assumed under the applicable road impact 
fee land use category specified in appendix C hereof, such applicant may, prior to issuance of a 
building permit for such road impact construction, file an alternative road impact fee study with the 
city manager. The city manager shall review the alternative calculations of the new net trips and 
make a determination within 60 days of submittal as to whether such calculation complies with the 
requirements of this section. 
(b) ?For purposes of any alternative road impact fee calculation, the road impact construction shall be 
presumed to have the maximum impact on the city street system for the trip generation land use 
category contemplated under the road impact fee rate. 
(c) ?The alternative road impact fee calculation of new net trips shall be based on data, information or 
assumptions contained in this article and the road impact fee study or an independent source, 
provided that: 
(1) ?The independent source is a generally accepted standard source of transportation engineering 
or planning information, or 
(2) ?The independent source is a local study supported by a data base adequate for the 
conclusions contained in such study performed by a professional engineer pursuant to a 
generally accepted methodology of transportation planning or engineering. 
(3) ?If a previously approved road impact construction project submitted, during its approval 
process, a traffic impact study substantially consistent with the criteria required by this section, 
and if such study is determined by the city manager to be current, the traffic impacts of such 
previously approved road impact construction shall be presumed to be as described in the prior 
study. In such circumstances, an alternative road impact fee shall be established reflecting the 
traffic impact described in the prior study. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a traffic 
impact study conducted more than one year earlier is invalid. 
(4) ?It is acknowledged that the road impact fee rates are based upon the applicable trip generator 
rates for the trip generation land use categories corresponding to the impact fee land use 
categories set forth in section 54-133. In recognition of such acknowledgment, the trip generator 
rates for the trip generation land use categories shall be considered an independent source for 
the purpose of an alternative road impact fee calculation without the necessity of a study as 
required by subsections (c)(1) and (2) of this section. 
(d) ?If the city manager determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant 
comply with the requirements of this section and that the calculation of the alternative road impact 
fee was by a generally accepted methodology that is consistent with the road impact fee study, then 
the alternative road impact fee shall be paid in lieu of the fee adopted in section 54-133 hereof. 
(e) ?If the city manager determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant 
to compute an alternative new net trips number do not comply with the requirements of this section, 
then the city manager shall provide to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, written 
notification of the rejection of the alternative road impact fee and the reasons therefore.

and wastewater impact fee study will require improvements and additions to the city sewer 
system to accommodate the utility needs of such growth and maintain the standards of service 
adopted by the city. 
(c) ?Future demand, as represented by sewer system impact construction, should contribute its fair 
share to the cost of improvements and additions to the city sewer system that are required to 
accommodate the use of the city sewer system by such demand. 
(d) ?Implementation of a sewer system impact fee to require sewer system impact construction to 
contribute its fair share of the cost of required capital improvements and additions is an integral 
and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management of the city.

Sec. 54-160.4. - Changes in size and use. 
    An impact fee shall be imposed and calculated for the alteration, expansion or replacement of a 
building or the construction of an accessory building or structure if the alteration, expansion or 
replacement of the building or the construction of an accessory building or structure results in a land use 
determined to generate greater impact than the present use under the applicable impact fee rate 
schedules adopted herein. The impact fee imposed shall be calculated as follows: 
(a) ?If the impact fee is calculated on a per dwelling unit basis and not on the basis of square 
footage, the impact fee imposed shall be the amount due under the applicable impact fee rate 
schedule for the impact fee land use category resulting from the alteration, expansion or 
replacement, less the impact fee that would have been imposed under the applicable impact fee 
rate for the impact fee land use category prior to the alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(b) ?If the impact fee is calculated on the basis of square footage, in the event the square footage of 
a building is increased, the impact fee due for the increased square footage represented by the 
capital facilities impact construction shall be calculated by determining the impact fee due 
according to the square footage resulting from the alteration, expansion or replacement, less 
the impact fee that would have been imposed for the original square footage prior to the 
alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(c) ?If the use of a building is changed after payment of the impact fee which results in a change in 
the applicable impact fee land use category of the building and such change is determined to 
generate a greater impact than the present use, the additional impact fee due for the change in 
use shall be calculated by determining the impact fee due according to the square footage of 
the building under the new impact fee land use category less the impact fee that was imposed 
for the square footage of the building under the original impact fee land use category. 
(d) ?If the impact fee is calculated on the basis of land use and not square footage, the impact fee 
imposed shall be the impact fee due under the applicable impact fee land use category resulting 
from the alteration, expansion or replacement, less the impact fee that would be imposed under 
the applicable impact fee land use category prior to the alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(e) ?If an impact fee is imposed for an accessory building or structure because such accessory 
building or structure is determined to generate a greater impact than the present use, the fee 
shall be that applicable to the impact fee land use category for the primary building. 
(f) ?For purposes of the water impact fees and sewer impact fees imposed pursuant to this article, 
the following shall apply: 
(1) ?Water impact fees and sewer impact fees, as applicable, shall be imposed and calculated 
for the alteration, expansion or replacement of sewer system impact construction or water 
system impact construction which will result in a land use determined to create an 
additional demand on either the city sewer system or the city water system. Whenever any 
person applies to connect to the city sewer system or city water system, the fees imposed 
shall be calculated on the entirety of the buildings. Where the alteration, expansion or 
replacement occurs on lands for which a sewer impact fee or water impact fee has already 
been paid, the fees imposed shall be only upon the additional demand created by the 
alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(2) ?No refund or credit shall be afforded an owner or applicant in the event of a diminution of 
use occurs after the sewer impact fee or water impact fee already paid has been expended 
or encumbered. For the purposes of this section, fees collected shall be deemed to be 
spent or encumbered on the basis of the first fee in shall be the first fee out.

(a) ?Subject to the terms and conditions of this section, a credit shall be granted against an impact fee 
imposed by this article for the donation of land or equipment, a monetary contribution or the 
construction of capital facilities required pursuant to a development permit or made voluntarily in 
connection with capital facilities impact construction. Such donations, contributions or construction 
shall be subject to the approval and acceptance of the city manager. No credit shall be given for the 
donation of land or construction unless such property is conveyed, in fee simple to the city without 
remuneration. 
(b) ?Prior to issuance of a building permit, or prior to physical connection to the city water system or the 
city sewer system for purposes of the water impact fees or sewer impact fees, the applicant shall 
submit a proposed plan for donations or contributions to the capital facilities to the city manager. The 
proposed plan shall include: 
(1) ?A designation of the capital facilities impact construction for which the plan is being submitted; 
(2) ?A legal description of any land proposed to be donated and a written appraisal prepared in 
conformity with subsection (e) of this section; 
(3) ?A list of the contemplated capital facilities improvements, apparatus or equipment sought to be 
donated and an estimate of the proposed construction costs certified by a professional architect 
or engineer; and

section and, if approved, establish the amount of credit in accordance with subsection (e) of this 
section. The city manager shall issue a decision within 60 days after the filing of the proposed plan. 
(d) ?In reviewing the proposed plan, the city manager shall determine: 
(1) ?If such proposed plan is in conformity with contemplated improvements and additions to the 
capital facilities; 
(2) ?If the proposed donation of land and construction by the applicant is consistent with the public 
interest; and 
(3) ?If the proposed time schedule is consistent with the capital improvement program for the capital 
facilities. 
(e) ?The amount of developer contribution credit shall be determined as follows: 
(1) ?The value of donated land shall be based upon a written appraisal of fair market value as 
determined by an M.A.I. appraiser who was selected and paid for by the applicant, and who 
used generally accepted appraisal techniques. If the appraisal does not conform to the 
requirements of this article and any applicable administrative regulations, the appraisal shall be 
corrected and resubmitted. In the event the city manager accepts the methodology of the 
appraisal but disagrees with the appraised value, he may engage another M.A.I. appraiser at 
the city's expense and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two appraisals. 
If either party does not accept the average of the two appraisals, a third appraisal shall be 
obtained, with the cost of said third appraisal being shared equally by the city and the owner or 
applicant. The third appraiser shall be selected by the first two appraisers and the third 
appraisal shall be binding on the parties. 
(2) ?The actual cost of construction to the capital facilities shall be based upon cost estimates 
certified by a professional architect or engineer. However, in no event shall any credit be 
granted in excess of the estimated construction costs approved by the commission unless the 
construction project is competitively bid, in which case, the credit shall be limited to the actual 
cost or 120 percent of the bid amounts, whichever is less; and 
(3) ?The land donations and construction contributions shall only provide improvements or additions 
to the capital facilities which are required to accommodate growth. 
(f) ?If a proposed plan is approved for credit by the city manager, the applicant or owner and the 
commission shall enter into a credit agreement which shall provide for the parties obligations and 
responsibilities, including, but not limited to: 
(1) ?The timing of actions to be taken by the applicant and the obligations and responsibilities of the 
applicant, including, but not limited to, the construction standards and requirements to be 
complied with; 
(2) ?The obligations and responsibilities of the commission including, but not limited to, inspection 
of the project; and 
(3) ?The amount of the credit as determined in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. 
(g) ?A credit for the donation of land or a credit for the construction of an improvement or addition to the 
capital facilities shall be granted at such time as the credit agreement is approved and executed by 
both the commission and the applicant or owner; provided, however, that in the event the applicant 
or owner fails to convey the property which is the subject of the donation to the city or such property 
is not ultimately accepted by the city in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement, then the 
credit for donation shall be revoked and all impact fees shall immediately become due and payable. 
The administration of said contribution credits shall be the responsibility of the city manager. 
(h) ?Any applicant or owner who submits a proposed plan pursuant to this section and desires the 
immediate issuance of a building permit prior to approval of the proposed plan shall pay the impact 
fees prior to the issuance of the building permit. Any difference between the amount paid and the 
amount due, should the city administrator approve and accept the proposed plan, shall be refunded 
to the applicant or owner.

    Development agreement means an agreement pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220. 
    Development order means any order issued by the city granting, denying or granting with conditions 
an application for approval of a development project or activity. The term "development order" 
encompasses the following: 
(1) ?Preliminary development approvals means a preliminary approval given by the city which does 
not authorize actual construction, alterations to land or structures or other development. A 
preliminary development order may authorize a change in the allowable use of land or a 
building, and may include conceptual approvals where a series of approvals are required before 
authorization to commence land alteration or construction may be given by the city. A 
concurrency reservation certificate is not required prior to the issuance of a preliminary 
development approval, which term shall include, but not be limited to: An order granting an 
administrative appeal; an amendment to the future land use map series of the plan; an 
amendment to the plan which affects land use or development standards; an order approving a

not changed, and all activities deemed not to constitute development as defined in this section. 
(3) ?Final development order means a final approval given by the city for a development project 
which has been precisely defined in terms of the intensity and use of the project. The final 
development order authorizes the project, whereas the preliminary development order 
authorizes specific components of the project. A concurrency reservation certificate is required 
prior to the issuance of a final development order, which term shall include, but not be limited to: 
A move-on permit for a manufactured structure which shall include single-family mobile homes 
as well as mobile homes used for nonresidential purposes, a permit for construction of a single-
family dwelling unit, a permit for an addition to any existing single-family dwelling unit, a permit 
for any nonresidential construction including the construction of any additional square footage to 
an existing nonresidential structure, a permit to move a building to a new site within the 
incorporated area of the city, final approval of plats, a home occupation permit, and permits for 
any modification to an existing structure or site where use or intensity is changed. No final 
development order shall be issued or granted by any board, commission, city manager or their

    Level of service (LOS) means an indicator of the extent or degree of service provided by, or 
proposed to be provided by, a facility based on and related to the operational characteristics of the facility. 
Level of service shall indicate the capacity per unit of demand for each public facility or service. 
    Lot includes the words plot or parcel. A lot or plot is a parcel of land of at least sufficient size to meet 
the minimum requirements set forth by the city as to use, lot coverage and area and to provide the 
setbacks required by the city. A lot is also defined as a single unit in a subdivision. 
    Memorandum of agreement means an informal agreement entered into by a developer and the city 
setting forth the terms which will serve as the basis of a future formal development agreement entered 
into pursuant to the requirements of this article as defined in this section. 
    Necessary facilities means public facilities and services necessary to accommodate the proposed 
development while maintaining the adopted level of service standards. 
    Pending application means an application for a concurrency reservation certificate for which a final

Sec. 54-197. - Short title. 
    This article may be referred to and cited as the "Concurrency Management Ordinance of the City of 
Palatka, Florida." 
(Ord. No. 08-03, § 1(exh. 1), 6-26-2008) 


Sec. 54-198. - Authority. 
    This article is adopted pursuant to F.S. chs. 125 and 163; Florida Administrative Code, Rule 9J5; the 
comprehensive plan; and the state constitution. 
(Ord. No. 08-03, § 1(exh. 1), 6-26-2008) 


Sec. 54-199. - Findings and intent. 
    The city commission finds and determines that: 
(1) ?The requirements and standards of this article are necessary for the health, safety and welfare 
of the citizens of the city and the protection of the environment and natural resources of the city; 
(2) ?It is the intent of the city commission to implement the goals, objectives and policies adopted in 
the comprehensive plan; 
(3) ?It is the intent of the city commission that necessary public facilities and services be available 
concurrent with the impacts of development; 
(4) ?It is the intent of the city commission that final development orders and permits be issued in a 
manner which does not result in a reduction of any levels of service below the adopted level of 
service standards in the comprehensive plan; 
(5) ?It is the intent of the city commission to adhere to and implement the schedule of capital 
improvements in the comprehensive plan and other capital improvements as necessary to 
maintain the adopted level of service standards in the comprehensive plan; 
(6) ?It is the intent of the city commission to adopt a reasonable concurrency management system 
in furtherance of the public benefit while at the same time ensuring that all property owners 
have a reasonable, beneficial and economic use of their property and that no property is taken 
without just compensation; 
(7) ?Not all development or development activity impacts are significant enough to cause the 
deterioration of the levels of service adopted in the comprehensive plan. It is, therefore, further 
found that the establishment of a de minimis developmental impact which will not cause an 
unacceptable degradation of levels of service is consistent with the goals, objectives and 
policies of the comprehensive plan. The application of this methodology by the establishment 
and recognition of certain types of de minimis development is found to be substantially related 
to the preservation of individual property rights in accordance with the state comprehensive 
plan.

Sec. 54-200. - Applicability. 
(a) ?The regulations set forth in this article shall apply to all lands and waters within the incorporated 
area of the city and subject to the jurisdiction of the city commission. No final development order or 
final development permit shall be issued unless in accordance with the provisions of this article. In 
order to develop land, the requirements of this article shall be met and the procedures set forth in 
this article shall be followed. 
(b) ?This article is supplemental to and does not supersede any applicable state statutes and 
regulations. 
(Ord. No. 08-03, § 1(exh. 1), 6-26-2008) 


Sec. 54-201. - Concurrency reservation certificate review, applicability. 
(a) ?A concurrency reservation certificate (CRC) shall be required prior to the issuance of all final 
development orders, but not for the preliminary development orders or preliminary development 
approvals. No final development order shall be issued or granted by any board, commission, 
department or agency of the city without a concurrency reservation certificate, unless in accordance 
with the criteria set forth herein. 
(b) ?In addition to the required concurrency review and determination for final development order, the 
city manager or his representative may review planned development rezoning applications or a 
substantial deviation to previously approved development of regional impact (DRI) or Florida Quality 
Development (FQD) pursuant to F.S. § 380.06(19), to the extent such deviation subjects the 
changed portion of the development of regional impact or Florida Quality Development to 
concurrency. In those cases where the city has determined that such an approval could lead to 
excessive impacts on public facilities and services needed to support the development, an advisory 
opinion may be issued setting forth the basis of such determination. Any approvals of a development 
application subject to such an advisory opinion must contain conditions to mitigate the identified 
impacts. Such conditions may include reduction of density or intensity, phasing of the project to 
match its impacts with planned expansion of public facilities, required improvements to public 
facilities, or other similar mitigating measures. 
(c) ?For purposes of determining concurrency and issuing a concurrency reservation certificate pursuant 
to a final development order, the city shall utilize the level of service standards set forth in the plan. 
(Ord. No. 08-03, § 1(exh. 1), 6-26-2008) 


Sec. 54-202. - Burden of compliance and application data requirements. 
    The burden of showing compliance with the level of service standards adopted in the plan shall be 
upon the applicant for a concurrency reservation certificate. All applicants for a concurrency reservation 
certificate (CRC) shall file a completed application, demonstrating compliance with the level of service 
standards and concurrency criteria with the city. Application forms and other informational requirements 
shall be specified in the Concurrency Management System Handbook, to be provided by the city at cost 
to prospective applicants and other interested parties. At a minimum, all applications for a CRC shall 
provide sufficient information to determine the impact of such development consistent with the 
concurrency standards, criteria and procedures set forth herein. Such information shall include, but not be 
limited to: 
(1) ?Total number and type of dwelling units for residential development applications; 
(2) ?Identification of type and intensity of nonresidential use, where appropriate, at a level of detail 
consistent with the proposed development; 
(3) ?Location of the proposed development and identification of facilities impacted by development 
pursuant to the provisions of section 54-204 and the concurrency criteria in sections 54-205 
through 54-207; and 
(4) ?Identification of project phasing, where applicable. 
All applications must demonstrate compliance with the applicable concurrency criteria (sections 54-205 
through 54-207) in a format and manner determined by the city. In demonstrating compliance with these 
criteria, the applicant for a concurrency reservation certificate must utilize the most recently available 
capacity information from the city as well as the demand generation rates and related data provided by 
the city. If other capacity data, demand generation rates, or related data is used as a basis for the 
application for a concurrency reservation certificate, such data must be specifically approved by the city. 
(Ord. No. 08-03, § 1(exh. 1), 6-26-2008) 


Sec. 54-203. - Concurrency reservation process. 
(a) ?A concurrency review certificate may be applied for at any time in the development review process 
but must be obtained prior to the issuance of a final development order, as defined herein. Upon the 
submittal of the required application materials and information and the payment of the specified filing 
fees, the city shall notify the applicant within five working days as to the sufficiency of such 
information for a concurrency determination. Once sufficient information has been received, the city 
shall review the information and determine whether the concurrency criteria and standards have 
been met. 
(b) ?If the concurrency reservation certificate application is approved, the written notification of approval, 
together with a concurrency reservation certificate, shall be issued to the applicant by the city within 
30 days from the date the application is accepted. 
(1) ?Single-family residential subdivision. 
a. ?Conditions for expiration. For a proposed single-family residential subdivision that has been 
issued a concurrency reservation certificate, the concurrency reservation certificate will 
expire when any of the following conditions have been met: 
1. ?The applicant fails to obtain preliminary plat approval within six months of concurrency 
reservation certificate issuance; 
2. ?The applicant fails to obtain final plat approval and complete all required infrastructure 
improvements according to city standards within 18 months of concurrency revenue 
certificate issuance; 
3. ?A period of 36 months elapses from the date of issuance of the final development 
order for the project; 
4. ?The final development order expires or is revoked by the city; 
5. ?The development agreement authorizing the project expires or is revoked by the city; 
or 
6. ?The project is completed as evidenced by final acceptance by the city and the 
issuance of a certificate of occupancy for all residential units within the project. 
b. ?Extension for infrastructure completion. For residential projects that have failed to complete 
all required infrastructure within the time period specified in subsection (b)(1)a.2. of this 
section, the applicant may apply for an extension of no more than 12 months provided that 
at least 50 percent of the required infrastructure has been completed prior to the request 
for extension. Only one such extension may be granted by the city at its discretion and for 
cause. 
(2) ?Multifamily residential; single-family development, not a subdivision; or nonresidential project. 
a. ?Conditions for expiration. For a proposed multifamily residential, single-family development 
not classified as a subdivision or as de minimis, or nonresidential project that has been 
issued a concurrency reservation certificate, the concurrency reservation certificate will 
expire when any of the following conditions have been met: 
1. ?The applicant fails to obtain a final development order, as defined herein, within a 
period of six months of concurrency issuance; 
2. ?The final development order for the project expires or is revoked by the city; 
3. ?The development agreement authorizing the project expires or is revoked by the city; 
4. ?The applicant fails to obtain a certificate of occupancy within 12 months from issuance 
of the project's final development order; or 
5. ?The project is completed as evidenced by final acceptance by the city and the 
issuance of a certificate of occupancy for all appropriate buildings within the project. 
b. ?Extension for obtaining certificate of occupancy. Multifamily residential and nonresidential 
projects that cannot meet the condition specified in subsection (b)(2)a.4 of this section may 
request an extension of time. Only one such extension may be granted by the city for a 
specified period of time and for cause. 
c. ?If the concurrency reservation certificate expires as a result of any of the conditions set 
forth in subsection (b) of this section, then the reserved capacity will be released and be 
available for other applicants. The reserved capacity will then be added to the available 
capacity in the concurrency management system database. 
d. ?If the concurrency reservation certificate application is denied, the written notification of the 
denial shall: 
1. ?Identify the decision reached in each facility category; 
2. ?Outline the procedures required to be followed in order to appeal the decision; 
3. ?Outline the procedures required to be followed in order to enter into a development 
agreement, binding executed contract or other negotiating process which, upon 
agreement by the city, would permit the approval of the application; and 
4. ?Notify the applicant that the application shall be given priority on a first-come first-
served basis for a period of 120 days over other applications accepted by the city 
subsequent to the denied application's acceptance date if the applicant executes a 
memorandum of the agreement expressing his intent to enter into a development 
agreement pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, within 30 days from the date of notification by 
the city, or files an appeal on the form provided by the city within 30 days from the 
date of notification by the city. If either the memorandum of agreement is executed nor 
the appeal is filed within 30 days from the date of written notification to the applicant 
by the city, the application shall automatically lose its priority status and shall be 
treated as any other new application in the event the applicant wishes to proceed with 
the proposed development at a later date. 
(Ord. No. 08-03, § 1(exh. 1), 6-26-2008) 


Sec. 54-204. - Concurrency review procedure. 
    The availability of the necessary facilities pursuant to a concurrency review and prior to the issuance 
of a concurrency reservation certificate shall be determined by the city from data supplied by the 
application according to the following procedure: 
(1) ?Identify infrastructure systems and subsystems that would serve the proposed development. 
This includes: Impacted roadways, considering trip lengths, trip generation and trip distribution 
parameters; water and wastewater treatment, collection and distribution system; community and 
neighborhood parks, related recreational facilities and equipment; solid waste collection and 
disposal systems; and drainage and stormwater management systems. 
(2) ?Calculate available capacity on each of the systems and subsystems that would serve the 
proposed development and be impacted by it, as identified in subsection (1) of this section. This 
calculation should be the amount of capacity over and above the level of service standards 
adopted in the plan, and should be based upon current used capacity, as well as reserved 
capacity for permitted but unbuilt developments. The city will maintain records and estimates of 
available capacity for appropriate infrastructure systems. 
(3) ?Determine the infrastructure demand and capacity required anticipated by the proposed 
development. This information will be calculated by the applicant based upon standard usage 
and demand generation rates available from or approved by the city. 
(4) ?Compare projected infrastructure demand and capacity required by proposed development 
with available capacity as determined in subsection (2) of this section. If infrastructure demand 
is less than or equal to available capacity, then proposed development can be accommodated 
without reducing facilities and services below their adopted level of service standards. Available 
capacity will be as defined herein. 
(Ord. No. 08-03, § 1(exh. 1), 6-26-2008) 


Sec. 54-205. - Transportation concurrencytransportation proportionate fair share program. 
    The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments in the city that have been 
notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the city 
CMS, including transportation facilities maintained by FDOT or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for 
concurrency determinations, pursuant to the requirements of subsection 54-205(a). The proportionate 
fair-share program does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-
share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency as provided by state or 
federal law, or to de minimis projects providing that the roadway on which a particular de minimis 
development will occur is operating at or below 110 percent of capacity. Further de minimis development 
approvals on a roadway that is operating above 110 percent capacity is prohibited by state law. No further 
development will be allowed to occur until the volume has been reduced to at or below 110 percent. 
(a) ?[Contribution requirements.] 
(1) ?An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city 
by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a. ?The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable 
land development regulations; and 
b. ?The five-year schedule of capital improvements in the city CIE or the long-term 
schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS includes a 
transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of 
the city transportation CMS. The provisions of subsection 54-205(a)(2) may apply if a 
project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within 
the local government CIE or an adopted long-term schedule of capital improvements. 
(2) ?The city may, at its discretion, choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation 
concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program by contributing to an 
improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the city transportation 
CMS, but is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or a 
long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS, where the 
following apply: 
a. ?The city adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to 
the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or long-term schedule of 
capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS no later than the next regularly 
scheduled update. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed 
improvement must be reviewed by the appropriate city agency, and determined to be 
financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16) (b)1, consistent with the 
comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this article. Financial 
feasibility for this section means that additional contributions, payments or funding 
sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully 
mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities; 
b. ?[Agreement between city and applicant.] If the funds allocated for the five-year 
schedule of capital improvements in the city CIE are insufficient to fully fund 
construction of a transportation improvement required by the CMS, the city may still 
enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing 
construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share is 
calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay 
for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the city, or the county (for 
non-city roadways), or the Florida Department of Transportation (for state roadways) 
the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. 
The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component 
must be adopted into the five-year capital improvements schedule of the 
comprehensive plan or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted 
long-term concurrency management system at the next annual capital improvements 
element update. 
(3) ?Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must 
meet design standards of the city for locally maintained roadways and those of the FDOT 
for the state highway system. 
(b) ?[Mitigation to impacted facilities.] Pursuant to policies in the intergovernmental coordination 
element and capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, the city shall coordinate 
with affected jurisdictions, including FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under 
the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share 
mitigation. An interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this 
purpose. 
(c) ?Application process. 
(1) ?Upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the applicant 
shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency 
through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the requirements of this section 
54-205. 
(2) ?Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a 
preapplication meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal 
requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on 
the SIS, then the FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the preapplication 
meeting. 
(3) ?Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes an application fee 
listed under subsection 54-21(2)a.2.iii, major development transportation and the following: 
a. ?Name, address and phone number of owner(s), developer and agent; 
b. ?Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
c. ?Legal description and survey of property; 
d. ?Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development; 
e. ?Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
f. ?Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s); and 
g. ?Copy of concurrency application. 
(4) ?The planning director or their designee shall review the application and certify that the 
application is sufficient and complete within ten business days. If an application is 
determined to be insufficient, incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of 
the proportionate fair-share program, then the applicant will be notified in writing of the 
reasons for such deficiencies. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 
30 days of receipt of the written notification, the application will be deemed abandoned. 
The planning director may, at their discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed 60 
days to rectify such deficiencies, provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the 
extension and has taken reasonable steps to rectify the deficiency. 
(5) ?Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for 
development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrency of the FDOT. The 
applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for 
inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(6) ?When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, the applicant shall be 
advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding 
agreement will be delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to the 
FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a SIS facility or other state 
roadway, no later than 60 days from the date at which the applicant received the 
notification of a sufficient application and no fewer than 14 days prior to the commission 
meeting when the agreement will be considered. 
(7) ?The city shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the commission meeting when the 
agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share agreement will 
be effective until approved by the commission. 
(d) ?Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1) ?Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, 
separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and 
contribution of facilities. 
(2) ?A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair 
market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not 
differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(3) ?The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall 
be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
"The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach 
roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being 
approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of 
roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the 
adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the 
improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS." 
OR 
Proportionate Fair-Share = ?[[(Development Trips;sub \sub;)/(SV Increase;sub \sub;)] × 
Cost;sub \ sub;] 
Where: 
Development Trips;sub \ sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under 
review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per 
the CMS; 
SV Increase;sub \ sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to 
roadway segment "i" per section E; 
Cost;sub \ sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i", Cost shall include all 
improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, 
planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated 
with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
(4) ?For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city shall 
determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained 
from the CIE, the MPO/TIP or the FDOT Work Program. Where such information is not 
available, improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
a. ?An analysis by the city of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from 
recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the city commission. In order 
to accommodate increases in construction material costs, project costs shall be 
adjusted by an inflation indicator; or 
b. ?The most recent issue of FDOT Transportation Costs, as adjusted based upon the 
type of cross section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on 
acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials 
due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not 
included in the adopted FDOT Work Program shall be determined using this method 
in coordination with the FDOT District. 
(5) ?If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value 
of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(6) ?If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, 
credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of 
the dedication at 100 percent of the most recent assessed value by the city property 
appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an 
independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The applicant 
shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title 
search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-
way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city estimated total proportionate 
fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. 
(e) ?Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1) ?Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to 
the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address 
the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the local government's 
impact fee ordinance. 
(2) ?Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the 
transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact 
fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fair-share agreement as 
they become due per the city impact fee ordinance. If the applicant's proportionate fair-
share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific 
stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay 
the remaining impact fee amount to the city pursuant to the requirements of the city impact 
fee ordinance. 
(3) ?Major projects not included within the local government's impact fee ordinance or created 
under subsection 54-205(a)(2)a. that can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted 
transportation system may be eligible at the city's discretion for impact fee credits. 
(4) ?The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of 
a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road impact fee credit 
based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be 
transferred to any other location unless provided for within the city's impact fee ordinance. 
(f) ?Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1) ?Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) the applicant shall 
receive a certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a 
development permit within 12 months of the execution of the agreement, then the 
agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to 
reapply. 
(2) ?Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the 
final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable. If the 
payment is submitted more than 12 months from the date of execution of the Agreement, 
then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based 
on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of 
payment, pursuant to subsection 54-205(d), as adjusted. 
(3) ?All developer improvements authorized under the transportation proportionate fair share 
requirements must be completed prior to issuance of a development permit, or as 
otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument 
that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. Unless otherwise 
established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is 
sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements, the required 
improvements are to be completed before issuance of certificates of occupancy. 
(4) ?Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate 
fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or 
recording of the final plat. 
(5) ?Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may 
be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change 
would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(6) ?Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at 
any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated 
advertising costs to the city will be nonrefundable. 
(7) ?The city may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor 
improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a 
shared transportation facility. 
(g) ?Appropriation of fair-share revenue. 
(1) ?Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for 
funding of scheduled improvements in the city CIE, or as otherwise established in the 
terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the discretion of the city, proportionate 
fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the 
capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. 
Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for 
funding under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program (TRIP). 
(2) ?In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues 
collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another 
improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of 
development pursuant to the requirements of subsection 54-205(a)(2)b. 
Where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant 
transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in F.S. § 339.155, 
and then the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply 
proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the 
impacted regional facility under the FDOT TRIP. Such coordination shall be ratified by the city 
through an interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking of the developer 
contributions for this purpose. 
APPENDIX A  
METHOD FOR COST ESCALATION 
Cost n = Cost 0 × (1 + Cost_growth 3yr ) n 
Where: 
Cost n = The cost of the improvements in year n; 
Cost 0 = The cost of the improvement in the current year; 
Cost_growth 3yr = The growth rate of costs over the last three years; 
n = The number of years until the improvement is constructed. 
The three-year growth rate is determined by the following formula: 
Cost_growth 3yr = [Cost_growth -1 + Cost_growth -2 + Cost_growth -3 ]/3 
Where: 
Cost_growth 3yr = The growth rate of costs over the last three years; 
Cost_growth -1 = The growth rate of costs in the previous year; 
Cost_growth -2 = The growth rate of costs two years prior; 
Cost_growth -3 = The growth rate of costs three years prior.

subparagraph, "temporary" shall be defined as any continuous stay of less than 48 hours. 
However, the mooring of a vessel shall not be defined as temporary if the vessel is being 
moored regularly and routinely at the city's public docking facilities, even if the vessel is moved

time, it is impossible to move the vessel without endangering the vessel or those who are

Sec. 74-7. - Preapplication conference; review of sketch plan. 
(a) ?Prior to the preparation of a subdivision plat, the subdivider may confer with the city clerk. It is 
suggested that the subdivider bring with him a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. A 
representative of the planning board will review such sketch plan to see if the subdivision meets the 
requirements of this chapter. This step does not require formal application or filing of the plat with the 
city clerk. Plats submitted will be referred to the planning board for approval. An agent representing 
the subdivider must appear at the next regular meeting held by the planning board to answer any 
questions concerning the proposed development. 
(b) ?After consideration by the staff of the city and planning board, the subdivider may then proceed to 
prepare the preliminary plat for submission. 
(c) ?Favorable consideration by the staff of the city and planning board shall under no circumstances be 
construed as preliminary or tentative approval.

together with other supplementary material as deemed necessary by the city and planning board as 
specified in section 74-10. 
(b) ?Submission of plat. Eight copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary material specified, 
together with two copies of a written application for conditional approval of the preliminary plat, shall 
be submitted to the city clerk and planning board at least 15 days prior to the meeting at which it is to 
be considered. The eight copies shall be turned over to the city clerk for proper distribution. 
(c) ?Review by city engineer. The city engineer shall examine and check the preliminary plat for general 
engineering and may require subsurface data of the tract, such as location and results of tests made 
to ascertain soil, rock and groundwater conditions; depth to groundwater unless test pits are dry at a 
depth of a predetermined number of feet; and results of soil percolation tests if individual sewage 
disposal systems are proposed. The city engineer will then make a report of his findings and 
recommendations to the city clerk within 15 days. 
(d) ?Action by planning board. Within 30 days after the submission of the preliminary plat and other 
material submitted in compliance with this chapter, the planning board shall express to the subdivider 
its approval as conditional approval and state the conditions of such approval, if any, or, if 
disapproval, shall express its disapproval and its reasons therefor. Prior to the meeting of the 
planning board at which the preliminary plat is to be considered, all owners of property abutting the 
property proposed for subdivision as shown on the preliminary plat will be notified by the city. A 
meeting shall be held between these property owners and the planning board in order to ensure the 
most orderly development of land in the area surrounding the subdivision under consideration.

Sec. 74-13. - Arrangement of streets. 
(a) ?Generally. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform 
to the major thoroughfare plan for the city and shall be considered in their relation to existing and 
planned streets, to topographical conditions, and to public convenience and safety, and in their 
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
(b) ?Relationship to existing streets. Where such is not shown in the major thoroughfare plan for the city, 
the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either: 
(1) ?Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding 
areas; or 
(2) ?Conform to a plan for a neighborhood approved or adopted by the planning board to meet a 
particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance 
to existing streets impracticable. 
(c) ?Layout of minor streets. Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be 
discouraged, and shall not be dead-end streets when it is possible to avoid this. 
(d) ?Subdivisions abutting or containing major streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing 
or proposed major street, the planning board may require minor streets, double frontage, with screen 
planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear 
service drives, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential 
properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(e) ?Subdivisions abutting or containing railroads or limited access highways. Where a subdivision 
borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the planning 
board may acquire a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a 
distance suitable for appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in a residential 
district, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be 
determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(f) ?Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their 
control is definitely placed in the city. 
(g) ?Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 200 feet shall be avoided. 
(h) ?Angle of intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practical. 
(i) ?Radius at intersections. At each street intersection, the property line at each block corner shall be 
rounded with a curve of radius "R" varying with the interior angle as specified in the following table, 
unless sufficient data is presented to show that strict adherence to this requirement is impracticable 
due to topographical or engineering considerations.

by Section 34, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878 by the 2001 Florida Legislature, regarding the City of Palatka's

    It is the intent of the City of Palatka to increase its local communications services tax rate as 
provided in Section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878 by the 2001 Florida Legislature. Section 13, Enrolled 
CS/CS/SB 1878 provides that notwithstanding any provision of F.S. ch. 202, to the contrary, any 
municipality that has a local communications services tax conversion rate established under F.S. § 
202.20, which is less than the maximum rate established under F.S. § 202.19, may by resolution or 
ordinance increase its rate up to the maximum rate established under F.S. § 202.19, with such increased 
rate to be effective October 1, 2001. For the period beginning on October 1, 2001, and ending September 
30, 2002, the maximum rate established under F.S. § 202.19, is deemed to be the sum of such maximum 
rate plus the difference between the conversion rates set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of F.S. § 
202.20(1). The municipality must notify the Department of Revenue of such increased rate by certified 
mail postmarked on or before July 16, 2001.

the provisions of Section 13 [Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878]. The local communications services tax rate for 
the City of Palatka is increased to 5.5 percent during the period beginning October 1, 2001, and ending 
September 30, 2002. As provided in section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878, this increased rate is to be 
effective October 1, 2001. 
    The local communications services tax conversion rate established under section 202.20(1)(b), 
Florida Statutes, for the City of Palatka is 5.0 percent, which is less than the maximum rate as established 
in Section 202.19(2)(a), Florida Statutes. The local communications services tax rate for the City of 
Palatka is increased to 5.1%. This increased rate is to be effective October 1, 2002.

authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and 
other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the 
placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications 
services providers; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. In regulating its public rights-of-
way, the city shall be governed by and shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws. 
(Ord. No. 02-03, § 2, 2-14-2002) 


Sec. 79-53. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the 
meanings given. Where not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the 
future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number 
include the plural number. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Words 
not otherwise defined shall be construed to mean the common and ordinary meaning. 
    Abandonment shall mean the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility; provided 
that this term shall not include cessation of all use of a facility within a physical structure where the 
physical structure continues to be used. By way of example, and not limitation, cessation of all use of a 
cable within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be "abandonment" of a facility in 
public rights-of-way. 
    Article shall mean this ordinance. 
    City shall mean City of Palatka, Florida. 
    Communications services shall mean the transmission, conveyance or routing of voice, data, audio, 
video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points, by or through any 
electronic, radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or 
hereafter devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, for purposes of this article "cable service", as defined in F.S. (2000) § 202.11(2), as it may 
be amended, is not included in the definition of "communications services," and cable service providers 
may be subject to other ordinances of the City of Palatka. 
    Communications services provider shall mean any person including a municipality or county 
providing communications services through the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in 
public rights-of-way "communications services provider" shall also include any person including a 
municipality or county that places or maintains a communications facility in public rights-of-way but does 
not provide communications services. 
    Communications facility or facility or system shall mean any permanent or temporary plant, 
equipment and property, including but not limited to cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, poles, 
antennae, converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand holes, manholes, vaults, drains, surface location 
markers, appurtenances, and other equipment or pathway placed or maintained or to be placed or 
maintained in the public rights-of-way of the City of Palatka and used or capable of being used to

trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor,

City of Palatka to the extent the city acts as a communications services provider.

construct, install, maintain, place, repair, extend, expand, remove, occupy, locate or relocate. A 
communications services provider that owns or exercises physical control over communications facilities 
in public rights-of-way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the 
facilities. A person providing service only through resale or only through use of a third party's unbundled 
network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities through which such service 
is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the public 
rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
    Public rights-of-way shall mean a public right-of-way, public utility easement, highway, street, bridge, 
tunnel or alley for which the City of Palatka is the authority that has jurisdiction and control and may

surface and the area below the surface. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public 
rights-of-way" shall not include any real or personal city property except as described above and shall not 
include city buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or other structures or improvements, regardless of 
whether they are situated in the public rights-of-way.

accordance with the provisions of this article.

Sec. 79-54. - Registration for placing or maintaining communications facilities in public rights-of-way 
(a) ?A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in 
public rights-of-way in the City of Palatka shall first register with the city in accordance with this 
article. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may place or 
maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b) ?A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-
way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications 
facilities in public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes or regulations may apply to the placement 
or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of facilities that are not communications facilities. 
Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access 
or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city's or another person's facilities. 
Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable 
City of Palatka ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(c) ?Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility 
in public rights-of-way in the City of Palatka shall file a single registration with the city which shall 
include the following information:

provides local service or toll service or both; 
(4) ?Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this article and acknowledgment that 
registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article, which acknowledgment shall not be 
deemed an agreement; and 
(5) ?The number of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications 
services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications 
Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any. 
(d) ?The City of Palatka shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such review shall be by 
the city manager or his or her designee. If the applicant submits information in accordance with 
subsection (c), above, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the 
effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been 
submitted in accordance with subsection (c), above, the city shall notify the applicant of the non-
effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply 
to an applicant within 30 days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. Non-
effectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for 
registration under the provisions of this section. An applicant has 30 days after receipt of a notice of 
non-effectiveness of registration to appeal the decision as provided in section 79-58. 
(e) ?A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the City of Palatka stating that it will no 
longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the City of 
Palatka and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant 
cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications 
facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f) ?Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or priority for the 
placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the City of 
Palatka but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by 
the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article 
and further subject to any additional city ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be 
enacted. 
(g) ?A registrant shall renew its registration with the City of Palatka by April 1 of even numbered years in 
accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially 
registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year 
immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even 
numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant 
to subsection (c), except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection (c)(3), a registrant shall provide updated 
information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal 
may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city 
restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has 
complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(h) ?In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a permit may be required of a 
communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in 
public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. 
Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply. A permit may be 
obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements 
are met.

transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated 
to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be 
provided by such registrant to the city within 20 days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or 
assignment.

federal law and city ordinances, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications 
facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b) ?A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-
way until all applicable permits, if any, have been issued by the City of Palatka or other appropriate 
authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that 
affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of 
a preexisting service. Registrant shall provide prompt notice to the City of Palatka of the placement 
or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency. 
Registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the city may impose 
reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility 
in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically 
identified in the permit. The city may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine 
maintenance and repair activities, that may otherwise require individual permits. 
(c) ?As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in 
public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide the following: 
(1) ?The location of the proposed facilities, including a description of the facilities to be installed, 
where the facilities are to be located, and the approximate size of facilities that will be located in 
public rights-of-way;

methods or techniques); 
(3) ?A maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way; 
(4) ?Information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility, if 
available (such information shall be provided without certification as to correctness, to the extent 
obtained from other persons); 
(5) ?If appropriate given the facility proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration to the public 
rights-of-way; 
(6) ?The timetable for construction of the project or each phase thereof, and the areas of the city 
which will be affected; and 
(7) ?Such additional information as the city finds reasonably necessary with respect to the 
placement or maintenance of the communications facility that is the subject of the permit 
application to review such permit application. 
(d) ?To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the City of Palatka shall have the 
power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a 
particular area of public rights-of-way. 
(e) ?All communications facilities shall be placed or maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with 
the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property 
owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional 
bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the 
co-location of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever 
feasible. The city manager or his designee may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations 
concerning the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way 
consistent with this article and other applicable law. 
(f) ?All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be

to its original condition before such work. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within 30 
days, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required under the circumstances, 
following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform restoration and 
charge the costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S.(2000) § 337,402, as 
it may be amended. For 12 months following the original completion of the work, the registrant shall 
guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any restoration work that does not satisfy the 
requirements of this article at its own expense.

rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S.(2000) §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as they 
may be amended. 
(i) ?A permit from the City of Palatka constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in 
public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant 
authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.

with accepted industry practice and applicable law.

way, and registrant may be required to reasonably alter its placement or maintenance schedule as 
necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way.

damage or destroy any facilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm 
drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the (municipality/county) or any other person's facilities lawfully 
occupying the public rights-of-way of the City of Palatka. 
(o) ?The City of Palatka makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or 
availability of the city's public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any 
performance of work, costs incurred or services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's sole 
risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the city's authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-
way, and the City of Palatka makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any 
added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(p) ?The City of Palatka shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed 
or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(q) ?A permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-
way shall include plans showing the location of the proposed installation of facilities in the public 
rights-of-way. If the plans so provided require revision based upon actual installation, the registrant 
shall promptly provide revised plans. The plans shall be in a hard copy format or an electronic format 
specified by the city, provided such electronic format is maintained by the registrant. Such plans in a 
format maintained by the registrant shall be provided at no cost to the city.

improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied 
by the registrant. The City of Palatka further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or 
cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within 
the limits of the City of Palatka and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(s) ?A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the City of Palatka, 
temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. 
The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting 
the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The 
registrant shall be given not less than 30 days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary 
relocation. 
(t) ?Any wireless telecommunication facilities are subject to the city's ordinance 97-19.

Palatka City Commission regarding a decision as to termination of registration. A decision by the city 
to terminate a registration may only be accomplished by an action of the Palatka City Commission. A

DIVISION 3. - CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL 


Sec. 86-81. - Purpose of division. 
    The purpose of this division is to: 
(1) ?Protect the public potable water supply of the city from the possibility of contamination or 
pollution by isolating within the customer's internal distribution system or the customer's private 
water system such contaminants or pollutants that could backflow into the public water system; 
(2) ?Promote the elimination or control of existing cross connections, actual or potential, between 
the customer's in-plant potable water system and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures 
and industrial piping systems; and 
(3) ?Provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control that will 
systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water 
systems. 
(Code 1981, § 19-54.1) 


Sec. 86-82. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings 
ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Approved means accepted by the authority responsible as meeting an applicable specification stated 
or cited in this division or as suitable for the proposed use. 
    Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the 
purveyor's approved public water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another 
purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source, such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor 
and so forth; used waters; or industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted, or they may 
be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not 
have sanitary control. 
    Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow in a potable water distribution system as a result of 
a cross connection. 
    Backflow preventer means an assembly or means designed to prevent backflow. 
(1) ?Air gap. An air gap is the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between 
the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet conveying water or waste to a tank, plumbing fixture, 
receptor or other assembly and the flood level rim of the receptacle. These vertical, physical 
separations must be at least twice the diameter of the water supply outlet, and never less than 
one inch (25 mm). 
(2) ?Reduced pressure backflow prevention assembly. The approved reduced pressure principle 
backflow prevention assembly consists of two independently acting approved checkvalves 
together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent pressure differential relief 
valve located between the checkvalves and below the first checkvalve. These units are located 
between two tightly closing resilient-seated shutoff valves as an assembly and equipped with 
properly located resilient-seated test cocks. 
(3) ?Double checkvalve assembly. The approved double checkvalve assembly consists of two 
internally loaded checkvalves, either spring loaded or internally weighted, installed as a unit 
between two tightly closing resilient-seated shutoff valves and fittings with properly located 
resilient-seated test cocks. This assembly shall only be used to protect against a non-health 
hazard (that is, a pollutant). 
    Backpressure means a pressure, higher than the supply pressure, caused by a pump, elevated tank, 
boiler or any other means that may cause backflow. 
    Backsiphonage means backflow caused by a negative or reduced pressure in the supply piping. 
    Contamination means an impairment of a potable water supply by the introduction or admission of 
any foreign substance that degrades the quality and creates a health hazard. 
    Cross connection means a connection or potential connection between any part of a potable water 
system and any other environment containing other substances in a manner that under any 
circumstances would allow such substances to enter the potable water system. Other substances may be 
gases, liquids or solids, such as chemicals, waste products, steam, water from other sources (potable or 
nonpotable), or any matter that may change the color or add odor to the water. 
    Cross connection control by containment means the installation of an approved backflow prevention 
assembly at the water service connection to any customer's premises, where it is physically and 
economically unfeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross 
connections within the consumer's water system; or it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow 
prevention assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's water system 
where there are actual or potential cross connections that cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at 
the point of the cross connection. 
    Cross connections controlled means a connection between a potable water system and a 
nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed and 
maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
    Hazard, degree of. This term is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and 
the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system. 
(1) ?Hazard, health means a cross connection or potential cross connection involving any 
substance that could, if introduced in the potable water supply, cause death or illness, spread 
disease, or have a high probability of causing such effect. 
(2) ?Hazard, plumbing means a plumbing-type cross connection in a customer's potable water 
system that has not been properly protected by an approved air gap or an approved backflow 
prevention assembly. 
(3) ?Hazard, non-health means a cross connection or potential cross connection involving any 
substance that generally would not be a health hazard, but would constitute a nuisance or be 
aesthetically objectionable if introduced into the potable water supply. 
(4) ?Hazard, system means an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical 
properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system or of a 
pollution or contamination that would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water 
in the system. 
    Industrial fluids system means any system containing a fluid or solution that may be chemically, 
biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted, in a form or concentration such as would constitute a 
health, system, pollution or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This may 
include but shall not be limited to polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process waters and used 
waters originating from the public potable water system that may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; 
chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies; circulating cooling waters connected to an open cooling 
tower and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; 
contaminated natural waters such as wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals 
or systems, and so forth; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions; and other liquid and 
gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes for firefighting purposes. 
    Pollution means the presence of any foreign substance in water that tends to degrade its quality so 
as to constitute a non-health hazard or impair the usefulness of the water. 
    Service connection means the terminal end of the service connection from the public potable water 
system, that is, where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point 
of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, 
then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There should be no 
unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention assembly located at 
the point of delivery to the customer's water system. The term "service connection" shall also include a 
water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service 
connections from the public potable water system. 
    Water distribution superintendent. The water distribution superintendent is invested with the authority 
and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross connection control program and for the 
enforcement of the provisions of this division. 
    Water, nonpotable means water that is not safe for human consumption or that is of questionable 
quality. 
    Water, potable means water that is safe for human consumption as described by the public health 
authority having jurisdiction. 
    Water, used means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable water system to a 
consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the 
sanitary control of the water purveyor. 
(Code 1981, § 19-54.3) 
Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2. 


Sec. 86-83. - Authority of water distribution superintendent. 
    The water distribution superintendent shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable 
water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or 
pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of the water distribution 
superintendent, an approved backflow prevention assembly is required (at the customer's water service 
connection or within the customer's private water system) for the safety of the water system, the water 
distribution superintendent or his designated agent shall give notice in writing to the customer to install 
such an approved backflow prevention assembly at specific locations on his premises. The customer 
shall immediately install such approved assembly at his own expense, and failure, refusal or inability on 
the part of the customer to install, have tested and maintain such assembly shall constitute grounds for 
discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. 
(Code 1981, § 19-54.2) 


Sec. 86-84. - Parts of water system. 
(a) ?The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the utility system and the customer 
system.

Sec. 86-121. - Baseline report for industrial users. 
    Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, industrial users 
subject to such standard shall submit to the city a report containing the following information: 
(1) ?The report shall include the name and address of the facility, including the name of the 
operator and owners. 
(2) ?A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility shall be included. 
(3) ?A brief description of the nature, average rate of production and standard industrial 
classification of the operations shall be included. The description shall include a schematic 
diagram of points of discharge to the POTW from regulated processes. 
(4) ?The measured average daily and maximum daily flow from each process stream, in gallons per 
day, shall be included. 
(5) ?The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. The 
user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration 
of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each process. These samples shall be 
representative of daily operations and include both maximum and average daily concentrations. 
Where feasible, samples must be obtained through flow proportional composite sampling 
techniques specified in the applicable categorical pretreatment standard. Where composite 
sampling is not feasible, a grab sample will be accepted. Where stream flow is greater than 
250,000 gallons per day, the user must take six samples within a two-week period. Samples 
should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities, if such exist, or 
immediately downstream from the regulated process, if no pretreatment exists. Sampling and 
analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, 
and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136, does not contain sampling or analytical 
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that part 136 
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and 
analytical methods as approved by the sewer plant superintendent and the administrator shall 
be used. The city may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical 
data, if the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for pretreatment 
measures. The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods 
of analysis and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work 
cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(6) ?The report shall include a statement reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial 
user and certified to by a qualified engineering professional, indicating whether pretreatment 
standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and 
maintenance and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the 
pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(Code 1981, § 19-79) 


Sec. 86-122. - Compliance schedule for industrial users. 
    The city shall have the right to require development of compliance schedules for users required to 
meet pretreatment standards. The proposed compliance schedule shall be submitted to the sewer plant 
superintendent for review and approval. This schedule shall be the time limits required for industrial users 
to provide additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance in order to meet the pretreatment 
standards. The completion date of this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established 
for the applicable pretreatment standard. The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of 
specific dates for completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of required 
pretreatment facilities necessary for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards. No 
increment of such schedule shall exceed nine months. Not later than 14 days following each date in the 
schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the city 
including whether or not it complied with the increments of progress to be met on such date and, if not, 
the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for the delay, and 
measures being taken to return to the schedule established. 
(Code 1981, § 19-80) 


Sec. 86-123. - Compliance date report for industrial users. 
    A user subject to the national categorical pretreatment standards and associated pretreatment 
requirements will submit to the sewer plant superintendent, within 90 days following the date for final 
compliance with such pretreatment standards and requirements, or in the case of a new connector, 
following commencement of wastewater discharge to the POTW, a report indicating the nature and 
concentration, as well as the average and peak daily flows, of all pollutants limited by such pretreatment 
standards and associated pretreatment requirements being discharged to the POTW. This report will 
indicate whether the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are being met on a consistent 
basis, and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance procedures and/or pretreatment will be 
implemented to bring the user into compliance with the applicable national categorical pretreatment 
standards and associated pretreatment requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized 
representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified engineering professional. 
(Code 1981, § 19-81) 


Sec. 86-124. - Periodic compliance reports for industrial users. 
(a) ?A user subject to the national categorical pretreatment standards and associated pretreatment 
requirements will submit to the sewer plant superintendent, during the months of June and 
December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standards or by the sewer plant 
superintendent, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which 
are limited by the referenced pretreatment standards. In addition, this report will include a record of 
the average and peak daily flows being discharged during the reporting period. At the discretion of 
the sewer plant superintendent and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, 
holidays, budget cycles, etc., the sewer plant superintendent may decide to alter the months during 
which the compliance reports are to be submitted by a particular user. 
(b) ?The sewer plant superintendent may impose quantum limitations on users which are practicing 
dilution to meet the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards and associated 
pretreatment requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of quantum limitations are 
appropriate. In such cases, the compliance report required by subsection (a) of this section will 
indicate the quantity of pollutants regulated by the pretreatment standards to be discharged by the 
user. These reports will contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge and will include 
a record of the flow, nature and concentration, or quantity in pounds where requested by the sewer 
plant superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment 
standards and associated pretreatment requirements. The frequency of monitoring will be prescribed 
in the referenced pretreatment standards. All analysis will be performed in accordance with the 
procedures established by the administrator pursuant to section 304(g) of the Clean Water Act and 
contained in 40 CFR part 136, and amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures approved 
by the administrator. Sampling will be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the 
administrator. It should be noted that, where 40 CFR part 136 does not include a sampling or 
analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis will be performed in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication entitled "Sampling and Analysis 
Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants," dated April 1977, and 
amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the 
administrator. 
(Code 1981, § 19-82) 


Sec. 86-125. - Special agreements for acceptance of industrial waste. 
    No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or 
arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength 
or character may be accepted by the city for treatment. However, there shall be no agreements made that 
would violate any state or federal pretreatment standard. 
(Code 1981, § 19-83) 


Sec. 86-126. - Measurements, tests and analyses of characteristics of wastewater. 
    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference

DIVISION 2. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 


Sec. 86-151. - Monitoring facilities; right of entry of enforcement officers. 
(a) ?Monitoring facilities. The city shall construct, operate and maintain, at the user's expense, 
monitoring facilities to allow inspection of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems and 
sampling and flow measurement of the waste being discharged to the POTW. Appropriate valving 
shall be included in design and construction of such facilities to halt discharges immediately and 
effectively under situations described in this article. The monitoring facility should normally be 
situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or 
cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public right-of-way and 
located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. Ample room shall be 
provided in the area of such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation 
of samples for analysis. The facility and sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at 
all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the city at the expense of the user. Whether 
constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be constructed 
in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and 
specifications. 
(b) ?Right of entry of enforcement officers. 
(1) ?The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is 
being met and that all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of the 
premises where wastewater is being generated and discharged to the POTW will allow the 
representatives of the city, the state or the EPA ready access at all reasonable times to all parts 
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and records 
duplication or in the performance of any of their designated duties. The city, the state and the 
EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to 
conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. In those 
cases where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification 
and clearance before entry into the premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with 
the user's security guards, so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from 
the city, the state and the EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of 
performing their specific responsibilities. Duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper 
credentials and identification shall be admitted with permission from proper authorities to all 
properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing 
pertinent to discharge to the sewer system in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(2) ?While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in this section, the 
authorized employees of the city shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises 
established by the company, and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the 
employees, and the city shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by 
city employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage 
asserted against the company, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the 
company to maintain safe conditions as required by this article. 
(3) ?Duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be 
permitted to enter all private properties through which the city holds an easement for the 
purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair and 
maintenance of any portion of the wastewater facilities lying within the easement. All entry and 
subsequent work, if any, on the easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the 
duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved. 
(Code 1981, § 19-87) 


Sec. 86-152. - Violations; penalties. 
(a) ?Damaging facilities. Any person who shall mischievously or maliciously handle, break or injure any 
machinery, appliance or appurtenance comprising any part of the city wastewater system, or who 
shall connect without permit to the city wastewater system, or who in any way tampers with any part 
of the city wastewater system, shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in section 1-10. 
(b) ?Theft of services. The existence of any device having as its apparent object the disposal of sewage 
into the city wastewater system without permit or payment of monthly charges for such services will 
constitute prima facie evidence of fraudulent appropriation of utility services by the person on whose 
premises such device was found or by the person occupying such premises. Normal monthly 
charges for service, including usage, for up to six months prior to discovery of the theft of services, 
shall be placed on the utility account of the location at which theft of services occurred. 
(c) ?Enforcement actions by city. 
(1) ?The city shall have the right to seek injunctive relief for noncompliance with pretreatment 
standards and requirements by industrial users. 
(2) ?Any user who is found to have willfully or negligently failed to comply with any provision of this 
article and the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued under this article shall be punished 
as provided in section 1-10. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be 
deemed a separate and distinct offense. In addition to the penalties provided in this subsection, 
the city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, court reporters' fees and other 
expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated this 
article or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued under this article. 
(3) ?The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution 
permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual 
or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial 
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, cause interference to 
the POTW, or cause the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
(4) ?Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater 
contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure 
of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as 
deemed necessary, including initiation of legal action by the city attorney and immediate 
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or 
endangerment to any individuals. The city shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit 
and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying 
discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the 
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be 
submitted to the city within 15 calendar days of the date of occurrence. 
(5) ?In the event of violation of this article, the health officer or authorized employees may verbally 
instruct the owner as to the necessary corrective action. If the owner fails to carry out verbal 
instructions in a timely manner or if a serious violation or hazard to public health exists, the 
health officer may issue to the owner a written order stating the nature of the violation, the 
corrective action and the time limit for completing the corrective action. This time limit will be not 
less than 24 hours and not more than six months, depending upon the type and severity of the 
violation. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease 
all violations. The record of the mailing of such notice or order shall be prima facie evidence 
thereof, and failure of the owner to receive the notice shall in no way affect the validity of any 
proceedings conducted pursuant to this article. 
(6) ?If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the city's wastewater 
disposal system contrary to the provisions of this article, federal or state pretreatment 
requirements, or any order of the city, the city's attorney may commence an action for 
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate court. 
(7) ?A person violating any provisions of this article authorizing action by the health officer as 
mentioned in this section shall be charged the normal and usual charges for discontinuance and 
disconnection of the water and sewer services. 
(d) ?State and federal authority. The state or EPA shall have authority to seek judicial relief for 
noncompliance by nondomestic wastewater dischargers, when the POTW acted to seek relief but 
has sought a penalty which the state or EPA finds to be insufficient. 
(e) ?Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or 
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be 
maintained pursuant to this article or a wastewater contribution permit, or who falsifies, tampers with 
or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall, 
upon conviction, be punished as provided in section 1-10.

DIVISION 5. - DISCHARGE RESTRICTIONS AND PROHIBITIONS 


Sec. 86-241. - General discharge prohibitions. 
(a) ?Prohibited substances. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any 
pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation or performance of the publicly owned 
treatment works (POTW). These general prohibitions apply to all such users of a POTW, whether or 
not the user is subject to the national categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. A user 
may not contribute the following substances to any POTW: 
(1) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted waters such as 
stormwater, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage or cooling water to any sanitary 
sewer. 
(2) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any sanitary wastewater into the storm 
sewer system, without exception. 
(3) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any liquids, solids or gases which by 
reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with 
other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to 
the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard 
meter, at the point of discharge into the system, or at any point in the system, be more than five 
percent, or any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. 
Prohibited materials include but are not limited to gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, 
toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, sulfides and any other 
substance which the city, the state or the EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard to the 
system.

clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt 
residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or 
polishing wastes. 
(5) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any garbage that has not been properly 
shredded. Garbage grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, 
institutions, restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments or similar places where garbage 
originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of consumption off the 
premises or when served by caterers. 
(6) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged wastewater containing more than 25 
milligrams per liter of petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils, or products of mineral oil 
origin. 
(7) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged wastewater containing more than 100 
milligrams per liter of oils, fat or grease. 
(8) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 
or greater than 9.0 or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing 
damage or hazard to structures, equipment and/or personnel of the POTW. 
(9) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any wastewater containing toxic 
pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or 
interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, 
create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or exceed the limitations set forth in 
the national categorical pretreatment standards. A toxic pollutant shall include but not be limited 
to any pollutant identified pursuant to section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act. 
(10) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any noxious or malodorous liquids, 
gases or solids which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a 
public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for 
maintenance and repair. 
(11) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any substance which may cause the 
POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be 
unsuitable for the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW 
cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or 
regulations developed under section 405 of the Clean Water Act, or any criteria, guidelines or 
regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal 
Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the 
sludge management method being used. 
(12) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any substance which will cause the 
POTW to violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality 
standards. 
(13) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any wastewater with objectionable color 
not removed in the treatment process, such as but not limited to dye wastes and vegetable 
tanning solutions. 
(14) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any waters or wastes containing odor-
producing substances exceeding limits which may be established by the city manager or his 
designee.

milligrams per liter BOD and TSS, 30 milligrams per liter TKN, and 15 milligrams per liter 
phosphorus). 
(16) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any wastewater having a temperature 
which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW, resulting in interference, but in no case shall 
wastewater be discharged with a temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius) 
or resulting in a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds 104 degrees 
Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). 
(17) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any pollutants, including oxygen-
demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a 
user knows or has reason to know will cause interference in the POTW. In no case shall a slug 
load have a flow rate or contain concentrations or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time 
period longer than 15 minutes more than five times the average 24-hour concentration, 
quantities or flow during normal operation. 
(18) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any wastewater containing any 
radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed the limits 
established in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(19) ?No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any wastewater which causes a hazard 
to human life or creates a public nuisance. 
(b) ?Enforcement. When the sewer plant superintendent determines that a user is contributing to the 
POTW any of the substances enumerated in subsection (a) of this section in such amounts which 
threaten to interfere with the operation of the POTW or may present an endangerment to the 
environment, the sewer plant superintendent shall have the authority to halt or prevent any discharge 
of pollutants to the POTW. The sewer plant superintendent shall allow the user 30 days for a 
response, which shall include the cause of the discharge and corrective measures taken. 
Wastewater service shall not be resumed until such corrective measures as needed have been 
undertaken to eliminate threat of interference or endangerment to the environment. Following this 
response period, the sewer plant superintendent, as he determines is necessary, shall begin 
development of effluent limitations and a compliance schedule for such user to correct the 
interference with the POTW. 
(Code 1981, § 19-65) 


Sec. 86-242. - Local pretreatment standards. 
(a) ?Limitations on specific pollutants. Local discharge limitations have been developed for the specific 
pollutants listed in this section in order to reduce the potential for interference with the POTW and 
limit sludge disposal practices. Any federal or state requirement and/or limitation more stringent than 
those imposed under industrial users of the POTW shall supersede these standards. The maximum 
one-day concentration of the following parameters shall be:

Sec. 86-250. - Accidental discharges. 
(a) ?Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other 
substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials 
shall be provided and maintained at the owner's cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities 
and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall 
be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a 
plan within one year of the issuance of an effluent permit. No user who commenced contribution to 
the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be 
permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been 
approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve 
the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the 
requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental or slug discharge, it is the responsibility of 
the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include 
the location of the discharge, the type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(b) ?Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the sewer plant 
superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to 
be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user 
of any expense, loss, damage or liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, 
fish kills or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any 
fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(c) ?A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising 
employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all 
employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the 
emergency notification procedure.

ARTICLE V. - WELLHEAD PROTECTION 


Sec. 86-371. - Title of article. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the City of Palatka Wellhead Protection Ordinance. 
(Code 1981, § 19-151) 


Sec. 86-372. - Intent and purpose of article. 
(a) ?Groundwater is the principal source of fresh water for public supply, rural, industrial and agricultural 
purposes in the state. In 1985, the state's average groundwater withdrawals totaled over 
4,000,000,000 gallons per day. Approximately 92 percent of the state's population depends upon 
underground sources of water for its drinking water supply, with approximately 20 percent of the 
population drinking untreated well water drawn directly from private wells. 
(b) ?Groundwater can become contaminated by many hazardous materials, such as pesticides, 
fertilizers, organic compounds and human waste. The degree of potential contamination depends 
upon soil characteristics, contamination characteristics, groundwater flow and other factors. Porous 
soils, such as sand located over shallow aquifers overlain by heavy clay soils, are less susceptible. 
(c) ?There are many potential sources for groundwater contamination. Spills and ruptures from storage 
tanks can rapidly introduce dangerous pollutants into the aquifer. Slower leaks and non-point 
discharges from many sources, along with regular infusion of septic tank effluent and contaminated 
stormwater runoff, also can accumulate and eventually contaminate the aquifer. 
(d) ?While the federal government, through the Environmental Protection Agency, and the state 
department of environmental protection administer numerous programs relating to groundwater 
protection, it is the local government, using the police power established by the Tenth Amendment of 
the U.S. Constitution, that is able to exercise greatest direct influence in groundwater protection 
through zoning, subdivision and other ordinances. This article is established to provide such 
influence. 
(e) ?This article is further intended to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare by providing for a 
zone of influence around wells serving the public, establishing permitted land uses within a wellfield 
zone of influence, and providing for the closure of unused wells. 
(Code 1981, § 19-152) 


Sec. 86-373. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed 
to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Aquifer means a formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that contains sufficient 
saturated permeable material to yield sufficient, economical quantities of water to wells and springs; or 
rock or sediment in a formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that is saturated and 
sufficiently permeable to transmit economic quantities of water to wells and springs. 
    Arbitrary fixed radii means circles with specified radii having no scientific basis normally drawn 
around wells or wellfields. 
    Calculated fixed radii means circles around wells or wellfields drawn with radii circulated under a 
formula based upon time of travel under specific conditions. 
    Cone of depression. See Zone of influence . 
    Groundwater means that part of the subsurface water that is in the saturated zone, or the water 
contained in the interconnected pores located below the water table in an unconfined aquifer or located in 
a confined aquifer. 
    Potable water means water suitable for human consumption as drinking water. 
    Recharge area means an area in which water reaches the zone of saturation by surface infiltration, 
or an area in which there are downward components of hydraulic head in the aquifer. Infiltration moves 
downward into the deeper parts of an aquifer in a recharge area. 
    Stormwater runoff means that part of precipitation flowing to surface streams, or the total amount of 
water flowing in a stream. It includes overland flow, return flow, interflow and baseflow. 
    Time of travel (TOT) means the time required for a contaminant to move into the saturated zone from 
a specified point to a well. 
    Zone of influence (ZOI) means the area surrounding a pumping well within which the water table or 
potentiometric surfaces have been changed due to groundwater withdrawal. 
(Code 1981, § 19-153) 
Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2. 


Sec. 86-374. - Applicability of article. 
    The provisions of this article relate to all potable water supplies which are listed with the state 
department of environmental protection as serving the public, i.e., a potable water system supplying water 
regularly to at least 15 connections or to at least 25 persons for at least 60 days per year. This definition 
includes all potable water systems serving residential communities, as well as industrial, commercial and 
recreational systems which supply potable water to employees, customers and/or the public. 
(Code 1981, § 19-154) 


Sec. 86-375. - Designation of wellhead protection zones. 
    Criteria on which protection zone delineation can be based include distance, drawdown of the water 
table, water travel time within the aquifer, flow system boundaries and the capacity of an aquifer to 
assimilate contaminants. The distance criterion defines a protection zone by establishing a radius 
measured from a wellhead out to a particular distance. This distance is known as the zone of influence or 
cone of depression, as stated in the August 1995 report entitled "Wellhead Protection Area Delineation," 
prepared by the St. Johns River Water Management District. 
(1) ?Wellfield "primary." The extent of the zone of influence for the wellfields located in the city has 
been established. Designated wellfield protection zones have been completed within the 
delineated protection areas as established by the referenced St. Johns River Water 
Management District report. Using calculations of an exact radius, public water wellfields shall 
be protected from adverse impacts of development by requiring a 100-foot fixed buffer of 
nonpolluting land uses radius zone around each wellhead as described in the St. Johns River 
Water Management District report. A wellfield "secondary" zone (part II) relates to the capture 
zone per well. Use table 5 in the St. Johns River Water Management District report. This radius 
should be sufficient as an interim measure to protect the wellhead from polluting sources 
pending further availability of soil, flow and aquifer drawdown data from the St. Johns River 
Water Management District. 
(2) ?Best management practices will be required. This entails shutting down the affected well and 
having the violator build a new one in a location approved by the city. 
(Code 1981, § 19-155) 


Sec. 86-376. - Wellhead protection management strategy. 
    The wellhead protection management strategy shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Limitations on permitted land uses, zone I. 
a. ?Public water wellfields shall be protected from adverse impacts of development by 
requiring a 100-foot primary protection zone of nonpolluting land uses radius zone around 
each wellhead as described in the St. Johns River Water Management District report. 
b. ?Nonpolluting land uses shall include recreation and conservation land uses, low and 
medium density residential land use, and commercial and industrial uses that do not, in 
their operations, produce, store, use or sell toxic materials as defined in SARA Title III 
(consolidated list of hazardous materials). 
c. ?Any activity located within this zone must be connected to a central water and sewer 
system. Any nonconforming land use located within 100 feet of a well serving the public will 
not be permitted to expand or be improved and will be phased out upon change of 
ownership. 
(2) ?Limitations on permitted land uses, zone II. Public water wellfields shall be protected from 
adverse impact by requiring a secondary protection zone from the extremity of zone 1 to a point 
500 feet from the wellhead. This secondary zone of nonpolluting land uses around each 
wellhead shall not contain toxins, shall provide containment for all potential pollution, and shall 
require a detailed site review prior to issuance of a permit. 
(3) ?Upgrading of facilities of nonconforming land uses. Potentially polluting land uses already in 
place within a zone of influence prior to August 27, 1992, shall be considered to be a 
nonconforming land use. Such land uses will be required to upgrade facilities or be phased out 
of polluting activities within five years of August 27, 1992. Upgrading shall include the 
application of any of the following methods deemed appropriate by the city to eliminate such 
pollution: 
a. ?Secondary containment may be required. 
b. ?A performance standard approach may be required. 
c. ?A detailed site plan review process may be required. 
d. ?Best management practices may be required. 
e. ?Parking lot runoff must be retained in a collection system and storage basin. 
f. ?Aboveground storage tanks shall be surrounded by a containment area to hold storage tank 
contents in case of leakage. 
g. ?Underground tanks shall have a monitoring well. 
h. ?All storage tanks shall be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems to guard against 
spillage from overfilling. 
(Code 1981, § 19-156) 


Sec. 86-377. - Administration and enforcement. 
    This article shall be administered and enforced by the city manager, who shall have the following 
powers and duties: 
(1) ?Investigate complaints, study and observe conditions of pollution or potential pollution, and 
make recommendations to the city commission for action necessary to abate the polluting 
situations; and 
(2) ?With approval of the city commission, coordinate with the city attorney to prosecute any 
violation of this article.

would normally be required on a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern, 
the zoning administrator may waive the requirement for the normal front yard and substitute 
therefor a special yard requirement, which shall not exceed the average of the yards provided 
on adjacent lots. 
(3) ?Depth of a required front yard shall be measured at right angles to a straight line joining the 
foremost points of the side lot lines. The foremost point of the side lot line, in the case of 
rounded property corners at street intersections, shall be assumed to be the point at which the

a strip of the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the 
rear lot line. 
    Yard, side. 
(1) ?A side yard is a yard extending from the interior (rear) line of the required front yard to the rear 
lot line, or in the absence of any clearly defined rear lot line to the point on the lot farthest from 
the intersection of the lot line involved with the public street. In the case of through lots, side 
yards shall extend from the rear line of front yards required. In the case of corner lots, yards 
remaining after front yards have been established on both frontages shall be considered side 
yards. 
(2) ?Width of a required side yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard established is 
a strip of the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the 
side lot line. 
    Yard, special means a yard behind any required yard adjacent to a public street required to perform 
the same functions as a side or rear yard, but adjacent to a lot line and so placed or oriented that neither 
the term "side yard" nor the term "rear yard" clearly applies. In such cases, the zoning administrator shall 
require a yard with minimum dimensions as generally required for a side yard or a rear yard in the district, 
determining which shall apply by the relation of the portion of the lot on which the yard is to be located to 
the adjoining lots, with due regard to the orientation and location of structures and buildable areas 
thereon.

Sec. 94-3. - Conditional uses. 
    A conditional use is a use that would not be appropriate generally or without restriction throughout a 
zoning district, but which, if controlled as to number, area, location or relation to the neighborhood, would 
promote the public health, safety, welfare, morals, order, comfort, convenience, appearance, prosperity or 
general welfare. Such conditional uses may be permissible in a zoning district if specific provision for 
such a conditional use is made in this chapter. All petitions for conditional use shall be considered first by 
the planning board in the manner set out in this section. 
(1) ?Written petition. A written petition for conditional use shall be submitted indicating the provision 
of this chapter under which the conditional use is sought and stating the grounds on which it is 
requested, with particular reference to the types of findings which the planning board must 
make under subsection (4) of this section. The petition should include material necessary to 
demonstrate that the conditional use will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of 
this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to adjoining properties or otherwise 
detrimental to the public welfare. Such material shall include but is not limited to the following, 
where applicable: 
a. ?Site plans at an appropriate scale showing proposed placement of structures on the 
property, provisions for ingress and egress, off-street parking and off-street loading areas, 
refuse and service areas, and required yards and other open spaces; 
b. ?Plans showing proposed locations for utilities hookup; 
c. ?Plans for screening and buffering with reference to type, dimensions and character; 
d. ?Proposed landscaping and provisions for trees protected by city regulations; and 
e. ?Proposed signs and lighting, including type, dimensions and character. 
Where this chapter places additional requirements on specific conditional uses, the petition 
should demonstrate that such requirements are met. Where the rezoning of land as well as a 
conditional use is required simultaneously for the same parcel of land, both petitions may be 
processed concurrently in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and section 
94-38. 
(2) ?Public hearing required. A public hearing shall be held by the planning board. Any party may 
appeal personally or by agent or attorney. 
(3) ?Notice of public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be given at least 15 days in advance 
of the public hearing. The owner of the property for which the conditional use is sought, or his 
agent or attorney designated by him in his petition, shall be notified by mail. Notice of the public 
hearing shall be prominently posted on the property for which the conditional use is sought. 
Notice of the public hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the city 
at least one time at least 15 days prior to the public hearing. Notice shall be given by mail to all 
owners of property within 150 feet of the boundary lines of the property for which the conditional 
use is requested; provided, however, that where the applicant is the owner of land not included 
in the applicant's application and such land that is not included in the application is a part of or 
adjoins the parcel for which the request is made, the 150-foot requirement shall be measured 
from the boundaries of the applicant's ownership, including the land not covered by applicant's 
application. For purposes of this subsection, owners of adjacent or nearby properties within the 
distance set out shall be deemed those whose names appear on the latest available tax rolls of 
the city. Failure of a property owner to receive mail notice shall not invalidate the hearing or 
subsequent action related thereto. 
(4) ?Findings. Before any conditional use shall be approved, the planning board shall make a 
written finding that the granting of the conditional use will not adversely affect the public interest 
and certifying that the specific requirements governing the individual conditional use, if any, 
have been met by the petitioner and that, further, satisfactory provision and arrangement has 
been made concerning the following matters, where applicable: 
a. ?Compliance with all applicable elements of the comprehensive plan. 
b. ?Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon, with particular reference 
to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access 
in case of fire or catastrophe. 
c. ?Off-street parking and loading areas, where required, with particular attention to the items 
mentioned in subsection (4)b of this section and the economic, noise, glare or odor effects 
of the special exception on adjoining properties and properties generally in the district. 
d. ?Refuse and service areas, with particular reference to the items mentioned in subsections 
(4)b and c of this section. 
e. ?Utilities, with reference to location, availability and compatibility. 
f. ?Screening and buffering, with reference to type, dimensions and character. 
g. ?Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting, with reference to glare, traffic safety, 
economic effects, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the district. 
h. ?Required yards and other open space. 
i. ?General compatibility with adjacent properties and other property in the district. 
j. ?Any special requirements set out in the schedule of district regulations for the particular use 
involved. 
k. ?The recommendation and any special requirements of the historic preservation board for 
uses within the HD zoning district. 
(5) ?Conditions and safeguards. 
a. ?In approving any conditional use, the planning board may also require appropriate 
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violations of such conditions and 
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional use is approved, 
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
b. ?Any conditional use shall expire six months from the date of approval unless, upon request, 
an extension of time is granted by the planning board, if by that date the use for which the 
conditional use was granted has not been commenced. Any conditional use shall expire 12 
months following the discontinuance of the use for which the conditional use was granted if 
the use has not been recommenced. 
(6) ?Denial. If the planning board shall deny a conditional use, it shall state fully in its record its 
reasons for doing so. Such reasons shall take into account the standards stated in subsection 
(4) of this section, or such of them as may be applicable to the action of denial, and the 
particular regulations relating to the specific conditional use requested, if any. 
(7) ?Appeals. Action taken by the planning board to approve a conditional use with appropriate 
conditions or safeguards or to deny a conditional use shall be deemed final unless a request is 
filed with the city clerk within 30 days from the date of such planning board decision requesting 
the city commission to review such decision. Any person aggrieved by an action of the city 
commission affirming, modifying or reversing such planning board decision may seek recourse 
to the courts as provided by the laws of the state.

applicable: 
a. ?Whether the proposed change is in conformity with the comprehensive plan.

f. ?Whether changed or changing conditions make the passage of the proposed amendment 
necessary. 
g. ?Whether the proposed change will adversely influence living conditions in the 
neighborhood. 
h. ?Whether the proposed change will create or excessively increase traffic congestion or 
otherwise affect public safety. 
i. ?Whether the proposed change will create a drainage problem. 
j. ?Whether the proposed change will seriously reduce light and air to adjacent areas. 
k. ?Whether the proposed change will adversely affect property values in the adjacent area. 
l. ?Whether the proposed change will be a deterrent to the improvement or development of 
adjacent property in accord with existing regulations.

owner as contrasted with the public welfare. 
n. ?Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accord with 
existing zoning. 
o. ?Whether the change suggested is out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or the 
city. 
p. ?Whether it is impossible to find other adequate sites in the city for the proposed use in 
districts already permitting such use.

consideration as to whether the proposed change will further the purposes of this chapter 
and other city ordinances, regulations and actions designed to implement the 
comprehensive plan.

planning board required by subsections (e) and (f) of this section shall be advisory only and shall not

the affirmative vote of four members of the city commission. 
(i) ?Reapplication for rezoning of property. Whenever the city commission has denied an application for 
the rezoning of property, the planning board shall not thereafter consider any further application for 
the same rezoning of any part or all of the same property for a period of 12 months from the date of 
such action. 
(j) ?Waiver of reapplication time limit. The time limits of subsection (i) of this section may be waived by

the city commission. The members of the board shall serve as follows: 
(b) ?Each member shall serve for a term of five years. Vacancies shall be filled by the city commission 
for the unexpired term. Any member may be removed by the city commission for cause after written 
charges have been filed and after a public hearing has been held, if such a hearing is demanded by 
the member so charged. 
(c) ?The board of zoning appeals shall each year select from its members a chairperson and vice-
chairperson. 
(d) ?The chairperson, or in his absence the vice-chairperson, may administer oaths. The board shall also

Sec. 94-62. - Meetings and rules of procedure; minutes; payment of expenses. 
    All meetings of the board of zoning appeals and all hearings shall be open to the public. Meeting 
shall be held at the call of the chairperson and at such other times as a majority of the board may 
determine. The minutes of the proceedings shall show the vote of each member upon every question 
decided by the board; or, if any member is absent or fails to vote, shall so indicate. A statement of the 
findings by the board shall be included in the minutes as to each case heard or considered by it. The 
board shall adopt its own rules of procedure, and a copy of such rules and all amendments thereto shall

reasonable hours. Expenses incurred by the board are to be itemized and shall be borne by the city, 
except as may be specified in this division. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-11(2)) 


Sec. 94-63. - Jurisdiction; required vote. 
(a) ?The board of zoning appeals as created in this division is a body of limited powers. The board shall 
hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement, decision or determination made by 
the zoning administrator. 
(b) ?The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, 
requirement, decision or determination of the officer from whom an appeal is taken to decide in favor 
of the applicant any matter in which the board is required to pass under the provisions of this 
chapter. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-11(3)) 


Sec. 94-64. - Special authority in relation to certain nonconforming uses. 
    If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or of a structure and 
premises in combination, may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same character, or to a 
more restricted but nonconforming use, provided that the board of zoning appeals shall find after public 
notice and hearing that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate to the district than the existing 
nonconforming use and that the relation of the structure to surrounding properties is such that adverse 
effects on occupants and neighboring properties will not be greater than if the existing nonconforming use 
is continued. In permitting such change, the board of zoning appeals may require appropriate conditions 
and safeguards in accord with the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-11(4)) 


Sec. 94-65. - Procedure for appeal to board. 
    Any person aggrieved by a ruling of the zoning administrator or any officer, department, board or 
bureau of the city concerning the interpretation, administration or enforcement of this chapter may appeal 
to the board of zoning appeals. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days, by filing with the board of 
zoning appeals a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, together with such plats and exhibits as 
are reasonably necessary. The board of zoning appeals may provide or prescribe the form upon which 
such appeals shall be filed. The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the board all of the papers 
constituting his record concerning the action from which appeal was taken. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-11(5)) 


Sec. 94-66. - Stay of proceedings pending appeal. 
    An appeal under section 94-65 shall stay all proceedings unless the official certifies to the board of 
zoning appeals, after the notice of appeal has been filed with him, that, by reason of facts which he shall 
set forth in his certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which 
case the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by 
the board of zoning appeals or by a court of competent jurisdiction on application, with notice to the 
zoning administrator. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-11(6)) 


Sec. 94-67. - Variances generally. 
    The board of zoning appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the 
terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, 
literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the 
spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done. Variances may be granted on 
development standards requirements only. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-11(7)) 


Sec. 94-68. - Prohibited variances. 
    No variance shall be allowed: 
(1) ?To permit a nonconforming use, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, in any district. 
(2) ?To permit a billboard to be erected or maintained. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-11(8)) 


Sec. 94-69. - Conduct of hearings. 
(a) ?Decisions, findings and recommendations of the board of zoning appeals shall be reached only after 
a public hearing and after notice has been given by mail to the applicant. The board of zoning 
appeals shall fix a reasonable time and place for the hearing of appeals and shall hear and decide 
the appeal within a reasonable time. Public notice shall be given of the time and place of such public 
hearing. Such notice shall contain the address or location of the property concerned for which a 
hearing by the board is sought, as well as a brief description of the nature of the application. 
(b) ?At the hearing, parties may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board of zoning appeals 
may, after such hearing, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the ruling, order, 
requirement, decision or determination appealed from, to conform with its conclusion as to the action 
which ought to be made in the premises, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from 
whom the appeal was taken; but shall not by such action vary from the scope, terms and intent of 
this chapter. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-11(9)) 


Sec. 94-70. - Appeal of decision by board. 
    Action taken by the board of zoning appeals to approve or deny a variance shall be deemed final, 
unless a request is filed with the city clerk within 30 days from the date of such board decision, requesting 
the city commission to review such decision. Any person aggrieved by an action of the city commission 
affirming, modifying or reversing such board decision may seek recourse to the courts as provided by the 
laws of the state. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-11(10); Ord. No. 98-14, § 1, 8-25-1998) 


Sec. 94-71. - Variance criteria. 
    Variances shall be considered for development standards only unless otherwise authorized in this 
chapter and other chapters of the Municipal Code. The following criteria shall be utilized in evaluating a 
requested variance: 
(1) ?Special conditions and circumstances exist such as size, shape, topography, or other unique 
features that are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved, and which are not 
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same vicinity or zoning district; 
(2) ?Such conditions and circumstances were not the result of the affirmative actions of the 
applicant and the applicant has acted in good faith; 
(3) ?Granting of the variance request will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is 
denied by the Municipal Code to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district; 
(4) ?Literal interpretation and enforcement of the applicable standard would deprive the applicant of 
rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of the 
Municipal Code, and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant; 
(5) ?No variance may be granted for a use of land or building that is not permitted; 
(6) ?The variance shall be the minimum variance necessary to alleviate the hardship; and 
(7) ?The variance would not cause substantial detriment to the public health, welfare, and safety of 
surrounding properties and community. 
(Ord. No. 11-73, § 1, 11-10-2011) 


Sec. 94-72. - Sign variance criteria. 
    The board of zoning appeals shall utilize the following criteria in considering sign variance requests: 
(1) ?That sign size or height limitations cause an exceptional and unique hardship. 
(2) ?That the unique hardship is not due solely to the owner's actions. 
(3) ?That the variance authorized will be compatible with the physical characteristics of the 
neighborhood.

NOTE: This table is for illustrative purposes only. Each specific land use in the city, including the overall 
development scheme for each use, should be analyzed for consistency with the entire comprehensive 
plan, regardless of the zoning district. Compliance with the requirements of the zoning district is only one 
step in that consistency analysis. 
_____
(c) ?Definitions of grouping of various districts. 
(1) ?Where the phrase "all residential districts," "residential districts," zoned residential" or 
"residentially zoned" are used in this chapter, the phrase shall be construed to include the R-
1AA, R-1A, R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 districts. 
(2) ?Where the phrase "commercial districts" is used in this chapter, the phrase shall be construed 
to include the C-1A, C-1, C-2 and C-3 districts. 
(3) ?Where the phrase "industrial district" is used in this chapter, the phrase shall be construed to 
mean the M-1 district. 
(d) ?Identification of official zoning map; contents. 
(1) ?The official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor and attested by the city 
clerk and bear the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify that the map to 
which this seal is affixed is the official zoning map of the City of Palatka referred to and adopted 
by reference by Ordinance No. 82-2 of the City of Palatka, Florida, adopted January 28, 1982, 
plus amendments." 
(2) ?The boundaries of each district shall be shown on the official zoning map and the district 
symbol as set out in subsection (b) of this section shall be used to designate each district. 
(e) ?Changes in district boundaries to be shown on official zoning map. If, in accordance with the 
provisions of this chapter, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the 
official zoning map, such changes shall be entered promptly on the official zoning map after the 
amendment has been approved by the city commission, with an entry on the official zoning map as 
follows: "On ____________ / ____________ / ____________ , by Ordinance No. ____________ of 
the City of Palatka, the official zoning map was changed as shown," which entry shall be attested by 
the city clerk. No amendment to this chapter which involves matter portrayed in the official zoning 
map shall become effective until such change and entry has been made on the official zoning map in 
the manner set out in this section. Such change shall be made within two working days after the 
effective date of the amendment. 
(f) ?Unauthorized changes to official zoning map. No changes of any nature shall be made in the official 
zoning map or any matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set out in this 
chapter. Any unauthorized change, of whatever kind, by any person, shall be considered a violation 
of this chapter and punishable as provided by section 1-10. 
(g) ?Official zoning map to be final authority as to zoning. Regardless of the existence of purported 
copies of all or part of the official zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the 
official zoning map, which shall be located in the office of the city clerk, shall be the final authority as 
to the current zoning status of all lands and waters in the city. 
(h) ?Retention of earlier zoning maps. All zoning maps, or remaining portions thereof, which have had 
the force and effect of official zoning maps for the city shall be retained as a public record and as a 
guide to the zoning status of land and water areas for the time periods involved. 
(i) ?Replacement of official zoning map. 
(1) ?If the official zoning map becomes damaged, lost, destroyed or difficult to interpret by reason of 
the nature or number of changes, the city commission may by resolution adopt a new official 
zoning map which shall supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map 
may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such 
correction shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning map. 
(2) ?The new official zoning map shall be authenticated as for the original, with wording to the 
following effect: "This is to certify that this official zoning map replaced the official zoning map 
adopted January 28, 1982, as part of Ordinance No. 82-2 of the City of Palatka, Florida." 
(3) ?Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost or has been totally destroyed, the prior map 
or any significant parts thereof remaining shall be preserved as a public record, together with all 
available records, minutes, ordinances or amendments pertaining to its adoption or amendment. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-2; Ord. No. 97-22, § 1, 9-11-1997; Ord. No. 05-30, § I, 6-9-2005; Ord. 
No. 12-02, § 2, 1-12-2012) 


Sec. 94-112. - Rules for interpretation of district boundaries. 
(a) ?District regulations extend to all portions of district. Except as otherwise specifically provided, a 
district symbol or name shown within district boundaries on the official zoning map indicates that 
district regulations pertaining to the district extend throughout the whole area surrounded by the 
boundary line. 
(b) ?Uncertain boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the 
official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1) ?Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets or alleys shall be 
construed as following such centerlines as they exist on the ground, except where variation of 
the actual location from the mapped location would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel, 
in which case the boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as to avoid changing the 
zoning status of any lot or parcel. In case of a street closure, the boundary shall be construed 
as remaining in its location except where ownership of the vacated street is divided other than 
at the center, in which case the boundary shall be construed as moving with the ownership, but 
not beyond the previous right-of-way line. 
(2) ?Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, public property lines and the like 
shall be construed as following such lines; provided, however, that where such boundaries are 
adjacent to a street or alley and the zoning status of the street or alley is not indicated, the 
boundaries shall be construed as running to the center of the street or alley. In the event of 
street or alley closure, interpretation shall be as provided in subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
(3) ?Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following such 
city limits. 
(4) ?Boundaries indicated as following railroad tracks shall be construed as being midway between 
the main tracks. 
(5) ?Boundaries indicated as following shorelines or centerlines of streams, canals, lakes or other 
bodies of water shall be construed as following such shorelines or centerlines. In case of a 
change in a shoreline, or of the course or extent of bodies of water, the boundaries shall be 
construed as moving with the change except where such moving would change the zoning 
status of a lot or parcel, and in such case the boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as 
to avoid changing the zoning status of any lot or parcel. 
(6) ?Boundaries indicated as entering any body of water but not continuing to intersection with other 
zoning boundaries or with the limits of jurisdiction of the city shall be construed as extending in 
the direction in which they enter the body of water to intersection with other zoning boundaries 
or with the limits of city jurisdiction. 
(7) ?Boundaries indicated as following physical features other than those mentioned in subsections 
(1) through (6) of this subsection shall be construed as following such physical features, except 
where variation of the actual location from the mapped location would change the zoning status 
of a lot or parcel, and in such case the boundary shall be interpreted in such manner as to avoid 
changing the zoning status of any lot or parcel. 
(8) ?Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale 
of the map. 
(c) ?Cases not specifically covered. In cases not covered in this section, the zoning administrator shall 
interpret the official zoning map in accord with the intent and purpose of this chapter. Appeal from 
the interpretation of the zoning administrator shall be only to the board of zoning appeals in 
conformity with section 94-65. 
(d) ?Division of lot of record by district boundary. Where a district boundary divides a lot of record in 
existence at the time the boundary was established, and where the division makes impractical the 
reasonable use of the lot, the extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot may be 
permitted as a conditional use beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-3) 


Sec. 94-113. - Applicability of district regulations. 
    The regulations set by this chapter within each district shall be minimum or maximum limitations, as 
appropriate to the case, and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure, use, or land or water. 
Except as provided in this chapter: 
(1) ?Use. No building or structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or 
structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered except in 
conformity with the regulations specified in this chapter for the district in which it is located. 
(2) ?Height of structures, population density, lot coverage, yards and open spaces. No structure 
shall hereafter be erected or altered: 
a. ?To exceed height or bulk limitations provided in this chapter; 
b. ?To provide a greater number of dwelling units or less lot area per dwelling unit than as 
permitted or required in this chapter; 
c. ?To provide less lot area per dwelling unit or to occupy a smaller lot than as permitted or 
required in this chapter; 
d. ?To occupy a greater percentage of lot area, or to provide narrower or smaller yards, courts 
or other open spaces, or lesser separation between buildings or structures or portions of 
buildings or structures, than required in this chapter; or 
e. ?In any other manner contrary to the provisions of this chapter. 
(3) ?Multiple use of required open space. No part of a required yard or other required open space, 
or off-street parking or off-street loading space, provided in connection with one structure or use 
shall be included as meeting the requirements for any other structure or use, except where 
specific provision is made in this chapter. 
(4) ?Reduction of lot area. No lot, combination of contiguous lots in common ownership, or yard, 
existing at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall hereafter 
be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth in this chapter, 
except by reason of a portion being acquired for public use in any manner, including dedication, 
condemnation, purchase and the like. Lots or yards created after the effective date of the 
ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall meet at least the minimum requirements 
established by this chapter. 
(5) ?Limitation on number of principal buildings on lots in residential areas. Except as provided in 
this chapter, only one principal residential building, except for multifamily buildings and cluster 
developments, may hereafter be erected on any lot. 
(6) ?Continuity of zoning of annexed property. Where property is annexed to the city subsequent to 
the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, such property shall 
continue to hold the zoning classification placed on it by the county; and the regulations 
applicable to it under the zoning regulation of the county shall be administered and enforced by 
the city until such time as the property has been reclassified in accordance with general law. 
(7) ?Planned unit development overlay threshold. Any proposed nonresidential development 
exceeding 20,000 square feet or residential development with project density exceeding five 
units per acre or residential development with more than five units shall be required to utilize a 
planned unit development overlay. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-4; Ord. No. 12-15, § 1, 3-8-2012) 


Sec. 94-114. - Nonconforming lots, structures and uses. 
(a) ?Intent. 
(1) ?Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, there 
exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before the ordinance 
codified in this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or 
restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. 
(2) ?It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are 
removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be 
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter 
that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, or be used as grounds 
for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(3) ?A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a 
structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of the ordinance codified in 
this chapter by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs or by addition of other 
uses of a nature which would be prohibited in the district involved. 
(b) ?Nonconforming lots of record. Where a lot of record exists which was held in individual ownership 
and platted and recorded in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county prior to the time of 
adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and such lot does not conform to the lot area or 
width requirements for the district in which it is located, the lot may be used for any use permitted in 
district provided all other development standards are met. 
(c) ?Nonconforming uses of land. Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the 
ordinance codified in this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under 
the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains 
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1) ?No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or expanded to occupy a greater 
area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance 
codified in this chapter. 
(2) ?No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or 
parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance 
codified in this chapter. 
(3) ?If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than six 
months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the requirements of this chapter for 
the district in which such land is located, and continuance of such use after such period is 
specifically prohibited. 
(d) ?Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or 
amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this 
chapter by reason of restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the 
structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise 
lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1) ?No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. 
(2) ?Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of 60 percent or more of its 
replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with 
the provisions of this chapter. 
(3) ?Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter 
conform to the requirements of the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(e) ?Nonconforming uses of structures. If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and premises in 
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this 
chapter that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may 
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1) ?No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is 
located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered 
except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
(2) ?If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and 
premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use, provided the board of zoning 
appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of 
section 94-64. 
(3) ?Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is 
superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the requirements of the district in 
which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(4) ?When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is 
discontinued or abandoned for six months, the structure, or structure and premises in 
combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the requirements of this 
district in which it is located. 
(5) ?Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal 
or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. 
(f) ?Nonconforming characteristics of use. If characteristics of use, such as residential densities, signs, 
off-street parking or off-street loading, or other matters pertaining to the use of land and structures 
are made nonconforming by this chapter as adopted or amended, no change shall thereafter be 
made in such characteristics of use which increases nonconformity with the regulations set out in this 
chapter; provided, however, that changes may be made which do not increase, or which decrease, 
such nonconformity. 
(g) ?Repairs and maintenance. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or 
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof. 
(h) ?Casual, temporary or illegal use. The casual, temporary or illegal use of land or structures, or land 
and structures in combination, shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming 
use or to create rights in the continuance of such use. 
(i) ?Conditional uses not nonconforming uses. Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a 
district under the terms of this chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but 
shall without further action be deemed a conforming use in such district. 
(j) ?Limited nonconforming structure enlargement or alteration. The zoning board of appeals is 
authorized to permit the enlargement or alteration of a nonconforming structure, except any sign, as 
a variance upon application, notice by posting property, and public hearing, upon finding and 
determining the following: 
(1) ?The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public interests; 
(2) ?Such enlargement or alteration is in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and all 
amendments thereof; 
(3) ?The enlargement or alteration, if allowed, will not violate any height, yard, setback, area or 
density limitations imposed by the zoning district in which the property is located, or if the 
enlargement or alteration would increase such violation, such enlargement or alteration would 
not adversely affect traffic flow, safety and control, pedestrian safety and convenience or 
visibility at any street intersections, drives, rights-of-way, curbcuts or crosswalks; 
(4) ?Such enlargements or alteration shall be compatible with adjacent properties and other 
properties within that zoning district; 
(5) ?If in a commercial, business or industrial zone, that adequate buffers are provided between 
such structures and adjacent residential areas; 
(6) ?That adequate off-street parking shall be provided for any multifamily, commercial, industrial or 
business use upon the property; and 
(7) ?The enlargement or alteration will not increase gross floor area of the principal structure by 
more than 50 percent. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-5; Ord. No. 11-24, § 2, 8-25-2011) 


Sec. 94-115. - Re-establishment of nonconforming uses. 
    In unusual cases where nonconforming uses are grounded in the community due to historical 
precedent and community support, should such uses cease to operate, their re-establishment shall be 
allowed within 36 months of the date the use ceased to function. Consideration of such requests shall be 
through the conditional use process.

permit uses not of a neighborhood or general commercial type and serve large sections of the city. 
This district is suitable for areas where commercial development has displaced or will displace 
residential uses, but it is not the intent that this district be used to encourage extension of strip 
commercial areas, since the pattern of existing development provides more than ample frontage for

dry cleaning establishments, animal boarding in soundproof buildings, book binding, pest 
control, plant nurseries or landscape contractors, carpenter or cabinet shops, home equipment 
rental, job printing or newspaper establishments, sign shops, upholstery shops, marinas, boat 
sales, boat storage, and commercial water softening.

manufacturing or processing is limited to that which employs not more than ten persons in the 
manufacturing and processing. 
(9) ?Boat yards and ways (see section 94-2, definitions). 
(10) ?Essential services (see section 94-2, definitions).

Sec. 94-163. - Planned industrial development district (PID). 
(a) ?Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to permit PID's which are intended to encourage the 
development of land as planned developments, encourage flexible and creative concepts of site 
planning; preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open 
areas; accomplish a more desirable environment that would not be possible through the strict 
application of the minimum requirements of these regulations; provide for an efficient use of land 
resulting in smaller networks of streets and utilities where access to regional systems is impractical 
and thereby lowering development costs; and provide a stable environmental character compatible 
with surrounding areas. This district is designed to accommodate a wide range of industrial uses 
while providing certainty to the public regarding permitted uses and site design. A written plan of 
development and a master plan detailing the potential uses of the site must be approved as part of 
any rezoning to PID. All subsequent development will be required to be consistent with the approved 
written plan of development and master plan. 
(b) ?Permitted uses. Any use permitted in C-1A, C-1, C-2, C-3 or M-1 may be allowed; however, the 
specific proposed use(s) must be specifically listed as permitted in the written plan of development 
and the general location identified on the approved master plan. 
(c) ?Building height. No building or structure shall exceed 45 feet in height above the required minimum 
finished floor elevation. 
(d) ?Performance standards: 
(1) ?Lot coverage. The maximum combined area occupied by all principle and accessory structures 
shall not exceed 70 percent of the total area. Also, the amount of impervious surface shall not 
exceed 80 percent of the lot area. 
(2) ?All development must meet the following criteria: 
a. ?The site must be two acres or more in size. 
b. ?The operation shall not utilize ingress and egress through any residential subdivision or 
residentially zoned land. Routes shall be chosen as to have the least impact on residential 
areas. 
(3) ?All development shall provide paved ingress/egress entrances from the right-of-way to all 
parking and shall pave all vehicular circulation on the site to reduce the impact of noise on the 
surrounding community. 
(4) ?All activity within 200 feet of a residential district boundary shall be conducted within completely 
enclosed buildings. All storage within 200 feet of a residential district boundary may be outdoors 
but shall be effectively screened by a solid wall, fence or planting so that the materials shall not 
be visible from the residential district. This requirement shall not apply to outside storage of 
aircraft. 
(5) ?Tree protection, landscaping and buffering shall comply with the provisions of article VI of the 
City Municipal Code. 
(6) ?Setbacks along collector or arterial roads. The minimum required building setback along a 
collector or arterial road shall be as follows: 
a. ?Along a collector road, the minimum required building setback shall be 25 feet. 
b. ?Along an arterial road, the minimum required building setback shall be 50 feet. 
(7) ?Waterfront setback. A minimum 50 feet setback from the waterfront is required for all new 
construction along the St. Johns River. 
    If any other setback requirement of this Code conflicts with the above requirements, the more 
restrictive requirement will apply. 
(e) ?Procedure for approval of a planned industrial development. The procedure for obtaining approval 
for a planned industrial development shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Preliminary planned industrial development and master plan approval: The applicant shall 
submit to the planning director, an application for the approval of the planned industrial 
development and shall submit the following exhibits at the same time: 
a. ?A written plan of development describing the general purpose and character of the 
proposed development including: 
1. ?Total gross acreage. 
2. ?Total square footage of buildings. 
3. ?All building setbacks. 
4. ?Permitted accessory uses and structures. 
5. ?General location and total amount of open space including wetland preservation and 
upland buffers. 
6. ?Total amount of passive recreation space. 
7. ?Maximum building coverage and impervious surface coverage.

(f) ?Processing the PID. The PID rezoning application will be reviewed as any other rezoning application 
prior to scheduling the rezoning application for public hearing. Staff comments related to the PID 
master plan must be addressed prior to processing the rezoning application. 
(g) ?Action by planning board. After a public hearing, the planning board may recommend to the city 
commission that the planned industrial development request be granted, be granted subject to stated 
stipulations and conditions, or be disapproved. In making its recommendation, the planning board 
shall find that the plans, maps and documents submitted by the applicant and presented at the public 
hearing do or do not establish that the applicant has met the requirements of the Municipal Code and 
in addition that: 
(1) ?The tract for the proposed planned industrial development is suitable in terms of its relationship 
to the comprehensive plan and that the area surrounding the proposed planned industrial 
development can continue to be developed in coordination and substantial compatibility with the 
planned industrial development proposed. 
(2) ?The requested planned industrial development meets the regulations set forth in this article, 
based on the design and amenities incorporated in the site development plan. 
(h) ?Binding nature of approval. All terms, conditions, safeguards and stipulations made at the time of 
approval for planned industrial development shall be binding upon the applicant or any successors in 
interest. Deviations from approved plans not approved as a minor or substantial change as set forth 
in this ordinance or failure to comply with any requirement, condition or safeguard shall constitute a 
violation of these zoning regulations. 
(i) ?Revision of an approved PID. Any proposed major change in the approved PID master plan which 
affects the intent and character of the development, permitted use, density or land use pattern, or 
similar substantial changes, shall be reviewed in the same manner as the initial PID master plan 
approval. A request for a revision of the PID master plan shall be supported by a written statement 
and by revised plans demonstrating why the revisions are necessary or desirable. 
    Minor changes, and/or deviations from the PID master plan, which do not affect the intent or 
character of the development, shall be reviewed and identified by the planning director and 
administratively approved by the same. Upon approval of the revisions, the applicant shall make revisions 
to the plans and submittals and file with the planning director. 
    Examples of substantial and/or minor changes are: 
Substantial changes: 
Permitted uses; 
Perimeter changes; 
Major street relocation; 
Change in building height, density, or land use pattern. 
Minor changes: 
Change in alignment, location, direction, or length of a local street; 
Reorientation or slight shifts in building locations. 
(j) ?Building permits. No building permit shall be issued for any portion of a proposed Planned 
Development until the Final PID Site Plan has been approved. 
(k) ?Final PID site plan. If approval for the PID is granted, the applicant shall submit to the Planning 
Director a Final PID Site Plan covering all or that part of the approved PID Master Plan upon which 
construction is to begin, at least 60 days prior to the commencement of construction. 
(l) ?Identification of district on official zoning map. The boundaries of all land approved for development 
as a planned industrial development shall, after such approval, be indicated on the official zoning 
map, and the appropriate zoning district designation, together with the symbol "PID," shall be 
indicated therein (e.g., M-1/PID). 
(m) ?Time limit for commencement of construction; lapse of approval. If construction has not been 
commenced, as determined by the planning director or as described in the PID, within five years 
after approval of the PID or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development plan phasing 
schedule, the approval of the development plan shall lapse and be of no further effect. 
    At its discretion and for good cause, the city commission may extend the phasing schedule, including 
commencement and completion dates, for one additional two year period for beginning construction. If the 
approval of a development plan lapses under this section, then a new rezoning petition will be required.

Sec. 94-164. - Downtown overlay zoning. 
(a) ?Intent. The downtown overlay zoning is intended to recognize the unique and historic function and 
appearance of the downtown retail business district and the surrounding area. The overlay provides 
regulations to help ensure that new infill buildings and the renovation of existing buildings will blend 
with the fabric of the physical environment of downtown Palatka, its existing buildings and the overall 
streetscape and not present a jarring contrast with existing community character and architecture. 
The overlay also encourages uses that contribute to a vibrant and active shopping and business 
area. 
(b) ?Downtown zones. The downtown area consists of two specific areas: the retail core and periphery. 
(1) ?Retail core. This area includes properties fronting on St. Johns Avenue between the Riverfront 
Park and North/South 11th Street, excluding properties fronting on the north side of St. Johns 
Avenue between North 4th Street and North 6th Street.

Sec. 94-199. - Communication antennas and communication towers. 
(a) ?Intent and purpose. Prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this section (Ordinance No. 97-
19), the zoning regulations contained no provisions specifically related to siting communication 
towers. It is the intent of this section to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens 
by regulating the siting of communication towers. Accordingly, the city commission finds that the 
promulgation of this section is warranted and necessary to accomplish the following purposes: 
(1) ?Direct the location of communication towers within the city. 
(2) ?Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of communication 
towers. 
(3) ?Minimize adverse visual and aesthetic impacts of communication towers through careful 
design, siting, landscape screening and innovative aesthetic mitigation. 
(4) ?Accommodate the growing need for communication towers. 
(5) ?Promote and encourage shared use/co-location of existing and new communication towers as 
the preferred option rather than construction of additional single-use towers. 
(6) ?Consider the public health and safety of communication towers. 
(7) ?Avoid or minimize potential damage to adjacent properties, from the perspective of public 
safety, from tower failure, through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. 
(b) ?Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
    Alternative tower structure means alternative-design mounting structures, including but not limited to 
manmade trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light poles, etc. 
    Antenna means any exterior apparatus designed to transmit and/or receive communications 
authorized by the Federal Communications Commission. 
    Communication tower means any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the 
purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers or 
monopole towers. The term "communication tower" shall not include towers utilized by amateur radio 
operators licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. 
    Tower site means a parcel of land, which may be smaller than the minimum lot size required in the 
zoning district, completely contained within a lot meeting the requirements of the zoning district, for the 
purposes of locating communication towers. 
(c) ?Applicability; use of existing structures. 
(1) ?All new communication towers in the city shall be subject to this chapter and all other 
applicable building and construction codes. In the event of any conflict between the zoning 
district regulations and the regulations contained in this section, the provisions of this section 
shall override and supersede such other regulations unless otherwise specifically set forth in 
this section. 
(2) ?All communication towers existing on May 8, 1997, shall be allowed to continue to be used as 
they presently exist. Routine maintenance (including replacement with a new tower of like 
construction and height and modifications to accommodate the co-location of an additional user) 
shall be permitted on such existing towers. New construction, other than routine maintenance 
and modifications to accommodate co-location on an existing communication tower, shall 
comply with the requirements of this section. 
(3) ?For purposes of this section, a communication tower that has received final approval in the 
form of either a variance or building permit, but has not yet been constructed, shall be 
considered an existing tower so long as such approval is valid and unexpired. 
(4) ?No rezoning or variance shall be required to locate a communication antenna on an existing 
structure; provided, however, that the antenna does not extend more than 20 feet above the 
existing structure. Such structures may include but are not limited to buildings, water towers, 
existing communication towers, recreational light fixtures and other essential public service 
structures. 
(d) ?Location on lot. A communication tower may be located on a lot utilized for other principal uses on a 
parcel smaller than the minimum lot size required in the zoning district. This parcel shall be 
considered as the tower site. The tower site, but not the entire lot, shall be subject to all of the 
requirements of this section, except as specifically provided in this section. 
(e) ?Minimum distance of towers from residential zoning districts. 
(1) ?Regardless of the zoning district in which the communication tower is located, the minimum 
distance of the tower shall be not less than 200 feet from the nearest residential lot line of any 
residential general or residential mobile home district and not less than 250 feet from the 
nearest lot line of any residential single-family district. 
(2) ?Minimum distances shall be measured from the center base of the communication tower to the 
lot line of the applicable residential zoning district or parcel, as the case may be. 
(3) ?Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, no communication tower other than a 
monopole (freestanding) tower or alternative tower structure shall be located in any residential 
zoning district. 
(f) ?Maximum height. 
(1) ?Maximum height is as follows: 
a. ?In all residential districts: 
1. ?If constructed for a single user, up to 50 feet in height. 
2. ?If constructed for two or more users, up to 90 feet in height. 
b. ?In all zoning districts: 
1. ?If constructed for a single user, up to 90 feet in height. 
2. ?If constructed for two or more users, up to 150 feet in height. 
(2) ?A communication tower shall be considered to be constructed for more than one user if: 
a. ?It is constructed so as to provide sufficient excess capacity over the initial single user 
loading for one or more additional comparable users; and 
b. ?The applicant consents in writing with the city to permit one or more additional comparable 
communication providers to use the proposed tower where feasible and subject to 
reasonable terms (as such terms are defined in subsection (q) of this section). 
(3) ?Measurement of communication tower height shall include the antenna, base pad and other 
appurtenances, and height shall be measured from the finished grade of the tower site. 
(g) ?Minimum yard requirements. There are no minimum yard requirements for communication towers. 
(h) ?Illumination. Communication towers shall not be artificially lighted except as may be required by the 
Federal Aviation Administration. If lighting is required, the applicant must present the city commission 
with available lighting alternatives so that the city is assured that the design to be utilized will cause 
the least disturbance to the surroundings. 
(i) ?Finished color. Communication towers not requiring Federal Aviation Administration painting or 
marking shall have either a galvanized finish or be painted a dull blue or gray finish. 
(j) ?Structural design. Communication towers shall be designed and constructed to ensure that the 
structural failure or collapse of the tower will not create a safety hazard, according to EIA/TIA 222-F 
standards, or the most current equivalent standards, to adjoining properties. Communication towers 
shall be constructed to EIA/TIA 222-E standards, as published by the Electronic Industries 
Association, which may be amended from time to time, and all applicable city building codes. All 
plans for the construction of towers shall be sealed by a Florida registered professional engineer. 
Further, any improvements and/or additions (i.e., antennas, satellite dishes, etc.,) to existing 
communication towers shall require submission of a site plan, sealed and verified by a professional 
engineer, which demonstrates compliance with the EIA/TIA 222-E standards in effect at the time of 
the improvement or addition. The plans shall be submitted to and reviewed and approved by the 
building department at the time building permits are requested. 
(k) ?Fencing. A minimum six-foot finished masonry wall or fence, other than chainlink, with not less than 
85 percent opacity, shall be required around all communication towers located in a residential or 
commercial zoning district. In all other zoning districts, the fence may be any type of security fence. 
Access to the tower shall be through a locked gate. 
(l) ?Advertising. Neither the communication tower nor the tower site shall be used for advertising 
purposes, and they shall not contain any signs for the purpose of advertising. 
(m) ?Landscaping. The visual impacts of residentially or commercially located communication towers 
shall be mitigated through landscaping or other screening materials at the base of the tower and 
ancillary structures. 
(1) ?The following landscaping and buffering of communication towers shall be required around the 
perimeter of the tower and accessory structures: 
a. ?A row of shade trees a minimum of ten feet tall and maximum of ten feet apart shall be 
planted around the perimeter of the fence. 
b. ?A continuous hedge at least 36 inches high at the time of planting, capable of growing to at 
least 48 inches in height within 18 months, shall be planted in front of the referenced tree 
line. 
c. ?All required landscaping shall be of the evergreen variety. 
d. ?All required landscaping shall be native drought-tolerant species and/or irrigated and 
properly maintained to ensure good health and variety. 
(2) ?Required landscaping shall be installed outside the fence or wall. 
(3) ?Existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be credited 
as appropriate toward landscaping requirements. 
(4) ?These standards may be waived by the building and zoning agency for those sides of the 
proposed tower that are located adjacent to undevelopable lands and lands not in public view. 
(n) ?Nonconforming towers. To the extent set forth in this section, the restrictions on nonconforming 
uses and structures contained in section 94-114 are modified and supplemented by this section. 
Bona fide nonconforming communication towers or antennas that are damaged or destroyed may be 
rebuilt, and all such towers or antennas may be modified or replaced, without meeting the minimum 
distance requirements specified in subsection (e) of this section. The type, height and location of the 
tower on the site shall be of the same type and intensity as the original facility approval. City 
structural requirements as specified in this section, however, shall be met, and a building permit shall 
be obtained within 180 days from the date the tower is damaged or destroyed. If no permit is 
obtained or if the permit expires, the communication tower shall be deemed abandoned as specified 
in subsection (o) of this section. 
(o) ?Abandonment. If the use of any communication tower has been discontinued for a period of 180 
consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the abandonment 
shall be made by the building and zoning department based on documentation and/or affidavits from 
the communication tower owner/operator regarding the issue of tower usage. Upon the building and 
zoning department's determination of such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have 
an additional 185 days within which to: 
(1) ?Reactivate use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual 
use of the tower; or 
(2) ?Dismantle and remove the tower. 
At the earlier of 185 days from the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon completion of 
dismantling and removal, any exception and/or variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire. 
(p) ?Certification of compliance with NIER standards. Prior to receiving final inspection, adequate proof 
shall be submitted to the building department documenting that the communication tower complies 
with all current Federal Communications Commission regulations for non-ionizing electromagnetic 
radiation (NIER), and that the radio frequency levels meet the standards of the American National 
Standards Institute. 
(q) ?Supplemental information required for applications for variances. The following information shall be 
included with all applications for zoning variances. The applicant may use any combination of site 
plans, surveys, maps, technical reports or written narratives necessary to convey the following 
information. 
(1) ?A scaled site plan clearly indicating the tower site, the type and height of the proposed tower, 
the location of the accessory buildings, on-site land uses and zoning, adjacent land uses and 
zoning, adjacent roadways, proposed means of access, distances from property lines, elevation 
drawings of the proposed tower, and any other proposed structures. 
(2) ?A current zoning or tax map or aerial map, as maintained by the county property appraiser's 
office, showing the location of the proposed tower. 
(3) ?A legal description of the parent tract and tower site, if applicable. 
(4) ?If the proposed tower site meets the required minimum distance from residentially zoned lands 
which are used residentially, the approximate distance between the proposed tower and the 
nearest residential dwelling, platted residentially zoned properties, or unplatted residentially 
zoned properties. If the proposed tower site does not meet the minimum distance requirements, 
then exact distance, locations and identifications of such properties shall be shown on an 
updated zoning or tax map. 
(5) ?A landscape plan showing specific landscape materials. 
(6) ?The method of fencing, finished color if applicable, the method of aesthetic mitigation and 
illumination. 
(7) ?If the applicant is not co-locating (sharing space) on the proposed communication tower of 
another communication provider, evidence that it has made diligent but unsuccessful efforts to 
co-locate its antenna and associated equipment on an existing structure. Evidence submitted to 
demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed 
antenna may consist of any of the following: 
a. ?No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet 
the applicant's engineering requirements. 
b. ?Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering 
requirements. 
c. ?Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the 
applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
d. ?The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the 
antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or 
structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
e. ?The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing 
tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development 
are presumed unreasonable. 
f. ?Property owners or owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to accommodate 
the applicant's needs. 
g. ?The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers 
and structures unsuitable. 
(8) ?The written consent by the applicant that any such variance shall be conditioned upon requiring 
the applicant to (i) construct the proposed communication tower so as to provide sufficient 
excess capacity over the initial single user loading for one or more additional comparable users, 
and (ii) permit at least one other comparable communication provider to use the proposed tower 
where feasible and subject to reasonable terms. The term "where feasible," as it applies to co-
location, means that utilization of a tower by another tower would, at the time of such utilization, 
comply with sound engineering principles, would not materially degrade or impair the 
communication tower's utilization by existing users, would not duly burden the tower structurally, 
and would not otherwise materially and adversely impact existing users. Reasonable terms for 
use of a communication tower that may be imposed by the owner include a requirement for 
reasonable rent or fees, taking into consideration the capitalized cost of the communication 
tower and land, the amount of lease payments by the owner, the incremental cost of designing 
and constructing the tower so as to accommodate additional users, increases in maintenance 
expenses relating to the tower, and a fair return on investment, provided such amount is also 
consistent with rates paid by other co-locators at comparable tower sites. 
(r) ?Standards for variances from minimum distance requirements. Notwithstanding any other variance 
criteria in this chapter, with respect to actions upon applications for zoning variances from the 
minimum distance required pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the board of zoning appeals 
shall grant a variance only if it finds from a preponderance of the evidence that the variance meets 
the following standards and criteria: 
(1) ?Certification is provided by a Florida licensed engineer that the proposed communication tower 
is reasonably necessary to serve adjacent or nearby residential areas. 
(2) ?The variance sought is the minimum necessary to address the need for the variance, 
subsequent to exploring all reasonable siting alternatives. 
(3) ?The location of the proposed communication tower in relation to the existing structures, trees 
and other visual buffers shall minimize, to the greatest extent reasonably practicable under the 
circumstances, any impact on affected residentially zoned property. 
(4) ?The location of the communication tower will not have a significant detrimental impact on 
adjacent property values. 
(s) ?Co-location. 
(1) ?In conjunction with the requirements of subsection (q) of this section, an applicant for a 
communication tower exception or variance, or an entity obtaining a development permit to 
construct a communication tower, shall cooperate with other communication providers in co-
locating additional antennas on communication towers permitted or otherwise authorized by the 
city. Such applicant or permit holder shall exercise good faith in co-locating with other providers 
and sharing the permitted site, provided such shared use does not give rise to a substantial 
technical level impairment of the ability to provide the permitted use (i.e., a significant 
interference in broadcast or reception capabilities as opposed to a competitive conflict or 
substantial financial burden). Such good faith shall include sharing nonproprietary technical 
information to evaluate the feasibility of co-location to the extent permitted by applicable law. If a 
dispute arises as to whether an applicant or permit holder has exercised good faith in 
accommodating other users, the city may require a third party technical study at the expense of 
either or both of the parties to the proposed co-location. 
(2) ?All applicants shall demonstrate reasonable efforts in developing a co-location alternative for 
their proposal. 
(3) ?Failure to comply with the co-location requirements of this section may result in the denial of a 
permit request or revocation of an existing permit for the specific tower. 
(t) ?Bonding; agreements granting city access and permission to remove abandoned towers. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, each application to the city for a development 
order or permit as defined in F.S. ch. 164, which will, if granted, have the effect of allowing of 
approving the location or construction of a communication tower, shall include the following: 
(1) ?A surety bond, issued by an entity rated "A" or better by A.M. Best Rating Guide, payable to the 
city in a form acceptable to the city manager. The amount of the bond shall be $25,000.00 or 
150 percent of the current engineer-certified cost to disassemble and remove the 
communication tower. The bond shall be valid for a minimum of 15 years and shall be renewed 
for additional periods designated by the city manager if the subject communication tower is 
remaining in place at the end of the original 15-year period. The bond shall be payable on 
demand of the city to cover the city's cost of removal of the subject abandoned communication 
tower which is not reactivated or removed in accordance with subsection (o) of this section. 
(2) ?An irrevocable license or easement, granted by the fee owner of the land underlying the tower, 
in favor of the city, to access the tower communication site for removal of the subject tower not 
complying with subsection (o) of this section. 
(3) ?Written permission from all record owners, beneficial owners and leaseholders of the tower in a 
form acceptable to the city for city staff, agents or contractors to enter upon the subject site and 
to remove the subject communication tower located there if it is found to be in violation of 
subsection (o) of this section. 
(u) ?Rights reserved by city. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, all owners and users of 
any type tower, both transmitting and receiving, are hereby placed on notice that the city may, in the 
future, subject to the common law vesting and other applicable law: 
(1) ?Require that towers constructed, permitted or otherwise authorized be dismantled and removed 
in their entirety at the licensee or permittee's sole expense if the U.S. federal government allows 
cities to: 
a. ?Reduce the number of towers in the city for any reason; and 
b. ?Regulate the location, spacing, size or use of such towers to a greater degree than is 
regulated or provided by this section. 
(2) ?Require the posting of a bond, payable to the order of the city, in the amount of $25,000.00 for 
each subject tower, to cover the city's expenses, if any, that may be incurred in enforcing such 
request. 
(v) ?Exemption for governmental entities. The city manager shall have the authority to exempt 
governmental entities from the provisions of this section if the communication tower is owned by the 
government entity and used for public purposes only. 
(Ord. No. 97-19, § 1, 5-8-1997) 


Sec. 94-200. - Outdoor promotional sales, special event sales and the sale of seasonal or temporary 
goods and commodities other than farmer's markets. 
(a) ?Intent and purpose. Prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this section (Ordinance 
Number 01-16), the zoning regulations contained no provisions specifically related to promotional, 
special event, or temporary sales. It is the intent of this section to promote the health, safety, and 
general welfare of the citizens by regulating the location and occurrence of outdoor promotional 
sales, special event sales, and the sale of seasonal and temporary goods and commodities, other 
than farmers markets. Accordingly, the city commission finds that the promulgation of this section is 
warranted and necessary to accomplish the following purposes: 
(1) ?Direct the location of outdoor promotional sales, special event sales, and the sale of seasonal 
and temporary goods and commodities within the city. 
(2) ?Protect incompatible land uses from potential adverse impacts of outdoor promotional sales, 
special event sales, and the sale of seasonal and temporary goods and commodities. 
(3) ?Minimize public safety impacts associated with outdoor promotional sales, special event sales, 
and the sale of seasonal and temporary goods and commodities. 
(4) ?Reimburse the city for the added expenses associated with the regulation and monitoring of 
outdoor promotional sales, special event sales, and the sale of seasonal and temporary goods 
and commodities within the city. 
(b) ?Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
    Outdoor promotional sales means a temporary sale, not to exceed 72 hours in duration, held outside 
of or away from a vendor's or merchant's normal business facility or location. Such sales may include 
those referred to as: "midnight madness", "truck sale", "tent sale", "sidewalk sale", "going out of business 
sale", "overstock sale", and similar promotions. 
    Seasonal goods or commodities means a temporary sale, not to exceed 45 days in duration, for the 
purpose of vending or selling goods or commodities relevant to the season, to include, but not be limited 
to, spring plant sales, Fourth of July fireworks sales, and Christmas tree sales. 
    Special event sales means a temporary sale held in conjunction with a parade, festival, or other such 
event, where the duration of the special event sale shall not exceed the specified period approved for the 
special event. 
    Temporary goods or commodities means a temporary sale, not to exceed 30 days in duration, for the 
purpose of vending or selling goods or commodities of a temporary nature, not in conjunction with a 
promotional, seasonal, or special event sale. 
(c) ?Procedures for review and approval. The planning director may approve the outdoor sale of certain 
goods and commodities which are strictly of a temporary nature in C-2 commercial zoning districts 
where sales of specific goods and commodities are included as permitted or accessory uses, 
provided the following conditions and requirements are met: 
(1) ?Such sales shall not be permitted on public rights-of-way; provided, however, that in areas 
zoned DB and DR, such sales and displays may be permitted on sidewalks only; and provided, 
further, that parades and art shows may be permitted on public rights-of-way under such 
conditions as are otherwise provided by ordinances and policies of the city commission. 
(2) ?No more than one use per location shall be issued in any given six-month period for seasonal 
and temporary-type sales, and no more than one use per location shall be issued in any given 
90-day period of time for promotional sales. 
(3) ?Application for a use under the provisions herein shall be reviewed by the planning director to 
ensure protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare, with public notice provided in 
the form of a letter to adjacent property owners within 150 feet. The planning director in 
considering outdoor sales requests, shall utilize conditional use criteria set forth in section 94-3, 
with particular attention given to traffic flow and control, auto and pedestrian safety, and the 
effect which such use and activity will have on surrounding uses, particularly where the 
adjoining use is residential. Appeals of unfavorable staff decisions shall be considered by the 
planning board utilizing the conditional use process. 
(4) ?The vendor, merchant, or applicant shall be required to remit to the city, following approval of 
the outdoor sales use, a business regulatory fee, which shall be in addition to any occupational 
license previously applied for or issued by the city, or as required by the city for vendors or 
merchants operating within the city. The business regulatory fee shall be subject to the 
following: 
a. ?The business regulatory fee shall be based on the real value of goods and commodities 
offered or displayed for sale, and shall be equal to one-half of one percent of the total real 
and just value of all goods and commodities offered or displayed, but in no instance shall 
the business regulatory fee exceed $1,500.00 for any single sale. 
b. ?Proof of real and just value shall be required to be provided to the city at the time of fee 
payment. Such proof shall be in the form of an invoice, bill of lading, or other reasonable 
verification of the actual value of goods and commodities offered for sale. 
c. ?Nonprofit and not-for-profit designated charitable or philanthropic organizations, possessing 
the appropriate Internal Revenue Service designations for corporations exempt from taxes, 
shall be exempt from the payment of the business regulatory fee, provided that each 
organization operating as a temporary vendor or merchant provide verification of the 
designation to the city. Such verification shall be provided prior to initiating the use. 
(5) ?All applicable licenses, fees, and permits, including, but not limited to, special use, tent, and 
sign permits, shall be required as provided for within this Code. No provision within this section 
shall render any other section, article, or chapter of this Code as invalid. 
(d) ?Non-temporary outdoor display. Display of goods will be allowed in conjunction with a principal use 
within commercial zoning districts, with the following applicable development standards: 
(1) ?A clear pedestrian pathway of at least 48 inches must be maintained at all times on the 
sidewalk, along the sidewalk perpendicular to the business and to the building entrance; 
(2) ?Building entrances must not be blocked; 
(3) ?Display items shall be limited to outdoor-oriented merchandise such as plants, lawn equipment, 
and barbecue grills; clothing on tables or upright racks; vending machines; or other 
nonperishable items on tables; 
(4) ?Display items shall be brought inside the store or secured at the end of each business day; and 
(5) ?Display areas shall present an orderly and organized appearance 
(e) ?Non-temporary outdoor sales. Non-temporary outdoor sales are allowed as a principal use in the C-
2 zoning district through the conditional use process in conjunction with a permanent enclosed 
structure that is minimum 600 square feet in size and is used for storage of goods, sales and display 
area, office, restrooms, etc. The following standards shall be met: 
(1) ?Minimum lot size of 1.0 acres, with a minimum frontage of 200 feet and a minimum lot depth of 
300 feet. 
(2) ?A 20-foot setback is required from any right-of-way for outdoor display areas and parking 
areas, which shall be buffered by a landscaped buffer area that is maintained in a neat 
appearance. One shade tree every 50 feet is required to further screen activities (when power 
lines or other obstructions are present, understory trees may be utilized, or trees may be 
planted in the right-of-way with the approval of the controlling jurisdiction). Gaps of more than 
50 feet without vegetative screening shall be planted with a centrally located grouping of at least 
five shrubs or two understory trees. 
(3) ?When adjacent to residential uses or zoning, six-foot high masonry wall, privacy fence, or 
hedge contained within 30-foot landscape buffer, and 100-foot setback from residential property 
lines. 
(4) ?Adequate refuse containers must be provided and must be screened with a six-foot tall privacy 
fence with a swinging gate. 
(5) ?All outdoor areas shall be cleaned of litter and refuse after each day of operation. 
(6) ?Adequate restroom facilities must be provided. 
(7) ?Sales may be operated by an individual vendor or by multiple vendors under the control of a 
central sales manager. 
(8) ?One parking space for each vendor must be provided, with an additional space for every 5,000 
square feet of outdoor and indoor sales area with a minimum of four spaces. 
(9) ?Uses are subject to sign code. Signs are allowed for individual vendors and displays, limited to 
each display area and not more than 20 square feet in size. The following signs are prohibited:

sign code provisions, these standards shall prevail. In general, exterior alterations shall be in keeping with 
the materials and appearance of historic downtown Palatka as represented by the period of significance 
between the 1880s and 1940s. 
(a) ?Awnings and canopies. 
 
 
Fig. 2: Appropriate awning types

ARTICLE V. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Cross reference Stopping, standing and parking generally, § 82-31 et seq. 


Sec. 94-261. - Generally. 
(a) ?Applicability of article. Wherever in any zoning district off-street facilities are provided for the parking 
or display of any and all types of vehicles, boats or heavy construction equipment, whether such 
vehicles, boats or equipment are self-propelled or not, and land is provided upon which vehicles 
traverse the property as a function of the primary use, including drive-in facilities (referred to in this 
article as "other vehicular uses"), such off-street facilities and land shall conform to the minimum 
requirements of this article. 
(b) ?Intent of article. It is the intent of this article that the public interest, welfare and safety require that 
every building and use erected or instituted after the effective date of the ordinance from which this 
article is derived shall be provided with adequate off-street parking facilities for the use of occupants, 
employees, visitors, customers or patrons. It is also the intent of this article that the public interest, 
welfare and safety require that certain uses provide adequate off-street loading facilities. Such off-
street parking and off-street loading facilities shall be maintained and continued so long as the main 
use continues. (For definitions of "parking space, off-street" and "loading space, off-street," see 
section 94-2.) 
(c) ?Compliance with article; general standards. 
(1) ?Parking and loading facilities required. Off-street parking and off-street loading facilities shall be 
provided as set out in this article. Conforming buildings and uses existing as of the effective 
date of this article may be modernized, altered or repaired without providing additional off-street 
loading facilities, providing there is no increase in floor area or capacity. 
(2) ?Parking and loading area surfaces. All parking and loading areas shall be surfaced with 
asphalt, concrete, brick, or other similar material as approved by the building official. Prohibited 
materials and surfaces for parking and loading areas include, but are not limited to, grass, tree 
bark, sawdust, pine needles, leaves, gravel, stones, sand, and mulch. Upon request by the 
property owner for which the paving is required an exception to the paving requirement may be 
granted by the building official, on a case by case basis, for a proposed use that occurs on a 
developed nonresidential site that does not require new construction or expansion of existing 
building footprint and parking area by more than ten percent. The property owner shall clearly 
demonstrate that paving of the parking area would require construction of stormwater retention 
or detention facilities for which there is not adequate available space within the site to construct. 
The property owner shall also take actions as a condition of permit approval to limit increased 
offsite transport of stormwater and sediments while also providing for some level of on-site 
retention or detention. Site design shall comply with the landscape code and shall include 
provisions that limit flooding impacts such as perimeter berms, swales, vegetated strips, 
underground stormwater storage, or other practices. The building official may opt to retain a 
licensed professional civil engineer to ensure that on and off-site flooding is minimized, with 
such efforts funded by the property owner. 
In addition, parking areas in excess of the minimum required spaces and required aisles and 
areas as established in this code may be surfaced with grass typically used for permanent 
lawns in the city. Such excess parking (in all zoning districts) must receive approval from the 
planning board as a conditional use. If approved, all such parking areas must be maintained in a 
well-graded fashion and if such grass ceases to grow, then paving of such an area in 
accordance with this section will be required. 
(3) ?Expansion of existing use. Where a conforming building or use existed as of the effective date 
of this article from which this is derived and such building or use is enlarged in floor area, 
volume, capacity or space occupied, off-street parking and off-street loading as specified in this 
article shall be provided for the additional floor area, volume, capacity or space so created or 
used. 
(4) ?Change in existing use. Change in use of a building or use existing as of the effective date of 
the ordinance from which this article is derived shall require additional off-street parking and off-
street loading facilities to comply with the requirements of this article for the new use. For 
purposes of this subsection, change of use shall mean a discontinuance of an existing use and 
the substitution therefor of a use of different kind or class. Change of use is not intended to 
include a change of tenants or proprietors unless accompanied by a change in the type of use. 
(5) ?Applicability to one- and two-family dwellings. The design, construction, landscaping and 
arrangement regulations set out in this article for off-street vehicular facilities do not apply to 
one- and two-family dwellings. 
(6) ?Use of required parking areas. Required off-street parking shall not be used for sales, dead 
storage, repair, dismantling or servicing of any type or kind, nor shall areas devoted to such 
activities count as meeting off-street parking requirements. 
(7) ?Location of parking areas in required yards. Subject to required buffer areas, required side and 
rear yards, but not required front yards, may be used for off-street parking in residential districts. 
Subject to required buffer areas, all required yards in commercial and industrial districts may be 
used for off-street parking. 
(8) ?Reduction of requirements for purpose of tree protection. The required number of off-street 
parking spaces or area of off-street loading facilities may be reduced by not more than ten 
percent where necessary to protect existing trees. 
(d) ?Design standards. Off-street parking facilities and other vehicular facilities, both required and 
provided, shall be subject to the following: 
(1) ?Identification. Such facilities shall be identified as to purpose and location when not clearly 
evident. 
(2) ?Drainage. Such facilities shall be drained so as not to cause any nuisance on adjoining or 
nearby properties. 
(3) ?Lighting. If artificially lighted, such facilities shall be so designed and arranged that no source of 
such lighting is visible from any adjoining or nearby property used or zoned for residential 
purposes and so designed and arranged as to shield public roadways and all other adjacent 
properties from direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind. 
(4) ?General arrangement. Such facilities shall be arranged for convenient access and safety of 
pedestrians and vehicles. 
(5) ?Vehicles backing onto public street. Such facilities shall be so arranged that no vehicle shall be 
required to back from such facilities directly onto public streets. 
(6) ?Marking of spaces. If such areas are in excess of 1,500 square feet or five off-street parking 
spaces, individual spaces shall be marked. 
(7) ?Curbs or wheel stops. Such facilities shall have curbs or motor vehicle stops or similar devices 
so as to prevent vehicles from overhanging on or into adjacent property or landscaped areas. 
(e) ?Location of parking facilities on separate lot. The required off-street parking facilities shall be located 
on the same lot or parcel of land they are intended to serve; provided, however, that the planning 
board may allow the establishment of such off-street parking facilities within 1,200 feet for all uses in 
the DB and DR zoning districts and 600 feet for other than residential uses in all other districts of the 
premises they are intended to serve when: 
(1) ?Practical difficulties prevent the placing of the facilities on the same lot as the premises they 
are designed to serve; 
(2) ?The owner of the parking area enters into a written agreement with the city and the owner of 
the property in need of off-site parking, with enforcement running to the city, and providing that 
the parking area shall be utilized as off-site parking so long as the facilities are required; and 
(3) ?The owner agrees to bear the expense of recording the agreement and agrees that the 
agreement shall bind his heirs, successors and assigns. The written agreement shall be voided 
by the city if other off-street facilities are provided in accord with this article. 
(f) ?Dimensions of parking spaces; aisle width. Each parking space shall be a minimum of ten feet by 20 
feet in size, except for non-public parking areas including display, fleet, and restricted parking, which 
shall be a minimum of nine feet by 18 feet in size. Minimum aisle width shall be as follows:

For purposes of rough computation, an off-street parking space and necessary access maneuvering room 
and required landscaping may be estimated at 400 square feet, but off-street parking requirements will be 
considered to be met only where actual spaces meeting the requirements in this subsection are provided 
and maintained, are improved in the manner required by this article and in are accordance with all 
ordinances and regulations of the city. 
ADD FIGURE page 1731 
(g) ?Plans for parking areas. A plan shall be submitted with every application for a building permit for any 
building or use that is required to provide off-street parking. The plan shall accurately designate the 
required parking spaces, access aisles and driveways, and the relation of the off-street parking 
facilities to the uses or structures such facilities are designed to serve. The proposed landscaping to 
comply with requirements of this chapter shall also be depicted on the plan, as well as tree protection 
requirements, where applicable. 
(h) ?Combined parking facilities; shared parking facilities. 
(1) ?Two or more owners or operators of buildings or uses requiring off-street parking facilities may 
make collective provision for such facilities, provided that the total of such parking spaces when 
combined or used together shall not be less than the sum of the requirements computed 
separately, except in accordance with this article. Any arrangement for combined off-street 
parking shall be subject to the filing of a legal instrument satisfactory to the city attorney insuring 
that such off-street parking will be maintained in the future so long as a use requiring such off-
street parking continues. 
(2) ?No part of an off-street parking area required for any building or use shall be included as a part 
of an off-street parking area similarly required for another building or use unless the planning 
board shall find that the type of use indicates that the period of usage will not overlap or be 
concurrent with each other. 
(i) ?Parking requirements in case of extension of nonconforming use. Where an extension of a use is to 
be made in a building occupied by a nonconforming use, no such extension shall be permitted 
unless and until the off-street parking requirements for a new use of the type involved are applied to 
the existing use and full provision for off-street parking facilities is made. 
(j) ?Parking requirements for uses not specifically mentioned. Requirements for off-street parking for 
uses not specifically mentioned in the schedule of district regulations shall be the same as provided 
in section 94-262 for the use most similar to the one sought, it being the intent of this article to 
require all uses to provide off-street parking, unless specific provision is made to the contrary. 
(k) ?Parking calculations resulting in fractional space. When units or measurements determining the 
number of required off-street parking spaces result in a requirement of a fractional space, then such 
fraction equal or greater than one-half shall require a full off-street parking space. 
(l) ?Parking requirements for mixed uses. In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off-street 
parking shall be the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately, and off-street 
parking space for one use shall not be considered as providing the required off-street parking for any 
other use. 
(m) ?Measurement standards for calculation of parking requirements. Floor area shall mean the gross 
floor area inside the exterior walls, where floor area is indicated in section 94-262 as a basis for 
determining the amount of off-street parking required. In hospitals, bassinets shall not count as beds. 
In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and other places of public assembly in which occupants utilize 
benches, pews or other similar seating arrangements, each 24 lineal inches of such seating facilities 
shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of computing off-street parking requirements. 
(n) ?Minimum parking requirement. Regardless of any other requirement of this article, each and every 
separate individual store, office or other business shall be provided with at least one off-street 
parking space, unless specific provision to the contrary is made in this chapter. 
(o) ?Off-street loading facilities required. 
(1) ?Off-street loading facilities are required by this article so that vehicles engaged in unloading will 
not encroach on or interfere with the public use of streets, sidewalks and alleys by automotive 
vehicles or pedestrians and so that adequate space is available for the unloading and loading of 
goods, materials or other things for delivery and shipping. Off-street loading facilities supplied to 
meet the needs of one use may not be considered as meeting the needs of another use. Off-
street parking facilities may not be used or counted as meeting off-street loading requirements. 
(2) ?When the use of a structure of land or any part thereof is changed to a use requiring off-street 
loading facilities, the full amount of off-street loading space required shall be supplied and 
maintained. When any structure is enlarged or any use extended so that the size of the resulting 
occupancy requires off-street loading space, the full amount of such space shall be supplied 
and maintained for the structure or use in its enlarged or extended size. 
(3) ?Each off-street loading space shall be directly accessible from a street or alley without crossing 
or entering any other required off-street loading space. Such loading space shall be accessible 
from the interior of the building it serves and shall be arranged for convenient and safe ingress 
and egress by motor truck and/or trailer combination. 
(p) ?Plans required for loading facilities. A plan shall be submitted with every application for a building 
permit for any use or structure required to provide off-street loading facilities. The plan shall 
accurately designate the required loading spaces, access thereto, dimensions and clearance. 
(q) ?Combined loading facilities. Collective, joint or combined provisions for off-street loading facilities for 
two or more buildings or uses may be made, provided that such off-street loading facilities are equal 
in size and capacity to the combined requirements of the several buildings or uses and are designed, 
located and arranged to be usable thereby.

(6) ?Protected trees identified for removal on the site clearing or tree removal application shall be 
replaced with new planted trees, unprotected trees or transplanted trees. Protected live oaks 
(Quercus virginiana) and all trees with a DBH greater than 36 inches removed shall be replaced 
only with live oaks. The total DBH inches of replacement live oaks shall equal two-thirds of the 
total DBH inches of protected live oaks and trees with a DBH greater than 36 inches removed 
(i.e., one 12-inch live oak removed could be replaced with two four-inch live oaks (8/12 equals 
two-thirds)). For other removed protected trees, the total DBH inches of replacement trees shall 
equal one-third of the total DBH inches removed (i.e., one 12-inch tree removed could be 
replaced with one four-inch tree (4/12 equals one-third)). When there is significant loss of 
mature tree canopy or specimen trees on a particular site, the size of replacement trees may be 
increased by up to twice the minimum DBH by the building department in order to compensate 
for that loss. If multi-trunked trees are used as replacement trees, then the total caliper of the 
four largest trunks shall equal the replacement DBH. New palms may be used only to replace 
protected palms removed. Replacement species used shall be approved by the building 
department. No replacement will be required for protected trees which are determined by the 
building department to be dead or deteriorated as a result of age, insects, disease, storm, fire, 
lightning or other acts of nature. 
a. ?New replacement trees shall meet the minimum standards for landscape materials 
established by section 94-295(b). 
b. ?Existing trees which are not protected trees, but which are either transplanted or not 
removed, may be utilized to satisfy tree replacement requirements, consistent with city 
landscaping requirements contained in sections 94-295 and 94-296. 
c. ?Existing protected trees which would otherwise be removed from the site because of 
development may be utilized to satisfy tree replacement requirements if transplanted to a 
location on the site which meets the landscaping requirements contained in sections 94-
295 and 94-296. 
d. ?If protected tree removal is associated with new development, the name, size and location 
of all replacement trees shall be shown on the required landscape plan and such trees 
shall be installed prior to the final building inspection. Otherwise, the name, size and 
location of the required replacement trees shall be shown on the site plan required for site 
clearing or tree removal and such trees shall be installed within the time limit stated on the 
site clearing or tree removal permit. 
e. ?Existing nonprotected trees, transplanted trees and new trees used for replacement 
become protected trees. 
f. ?Replacement trees shall be maintained pursuant to the requirements of section 94-295(b), 
pertaining to installation and maintenance. 
g. ?Replacement trees may be used to satisfy the tree requirements of sections 94-295 and 
94-296. 
h. ?A tree used for replacement shall be at least ten feet from any other tree planted, 
transplanted or preserved. 
(d) ?Tree protection during development. All protected trees, and trees retained for tree credit under this 
section, shall be protected from injury during any land clearing or construction in the following 
manner: 
(1) ?Prior to any land clearing operations, tree limbs which interfere with construction shall be 
removed and temporary barriers shall be installed around all trees to remain within the limits of 
land clearing or construction and shall remain until the completion of the work. The temporary 
barrier shall be at least three feet high, shall be placed at least six feet away from the base of 
any tree, and shall include at least 50 percent of the area under the dripline of any protected 
tree retained for tree credit. The barrier shall consist of either a wood fence with two-by-four 
posts placed a maximum of eight feet apart with a two-by-four minimum top rail, or a temporary 
wire mesh fence, or other similar barrier which will limit access to the protected area. 
(2) ?No materials, trailers, equipment or chemicals shall be stored, operated, dumped, buried or 
burned within the protected areas. No attachment, wires (other than protective guy wires), signs 
or permits shall be attached to a protected tree. 
(e) ?Correction of violations; appeals; permit fee. 
(1) ?Correction of violations. A violation of this section shall be corrected as follows: By replacing 
the protected trees removed without a permit with new planted trees, unprotected trees or 
transplanted trees. The total DBH inches of replacement trees shall equal the total DBH inches 
removed (i.e., one 12-inch tree removed could be replaced with three four-inch trees). A tree 
replanting plan showing how the damage caused to the site by the violation will be mitigated 
shall be subject to the review and approval of the building department. No work shall be allowed 
on the property where the violation occurred without payment of required fees and approval of 
the tree replanting plan. 
(2) ?Appeals. A person aggrieved by an administrative order, determination or decision of the 
building department may appeal the order, determination or decision to the board of zoning 
appeals for a variance from the requirements of this subsection. 
(3) ?Permit fee. The fee for a site clearing and/or tree removal/relocation permit shall be as set out 
in appendix A to this Code, as amended from time to time.

purpose of this subsection, two palm trees shall equal one tree credit. Trees shall be planted in 
planting areas having a minimum area of 25 square feet with a minimum distance of 2½ feet 
measured from the center of the tree trunk to the near edge of the landscape area. 
(3) ?Shrubs. Shrubs shall be a minimum of 24 inches high and 15 inches wide upon installation. 
Shrub species not commonly available from commercial nurseries that do not meet these 
requirements upon installation, but which will achieve required height and mass, may be used at 
the discretion of the building department. Good cause must be shown, with the burden of proof 
upon the applicant. 
(4) ?Vines. Vines shall be a minimum of 30 inches in height six months after planting and should be 
used in conjunction with fences, screens or walls to meet physical barrier requirements as 
specified. 
(5) ?Ground covers. Ground covers other than grass shall be planted in such a manner as to 
present a finished appearance and reasonably complete vegetative coverage within six months 
after planting. 
(6) ?Lawn grass. Solid sod grass shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion. 
(7) ?Permanent architectural planters. The use of permanent architectural planters may be 
permitted in fulfillment of land scape requirements. Such architectural planters shall contain not 
less than ten square feet and shall have a depth of not less than 15 inches. 
(8) ?Mulching or covering of planting areas. All planting areas shall be covered with grass or other 
ground cover (including inanimate materials such as bark, etc.,) where not otherwise 
landscaped. Mulch is required in all shrub beds. All other planting areas shall be covered with 
grass or ground cover. 
(9) ?Trees not eligible for landscape credit. The following trees are not native Florida tree species. 
They typically out-compete and cause the decline of native trees and have a high susceptibility 
to wind and cold damage. They are discouraged from use in landscaping in an effort to prevent 
additional distribution of the trees in the area. They may be used for landscaping, but will not 
count towards landscaping requirements noted in this section: 
a. ?Tallow tree (Chinese tallow tree). 
b. ?Camphor tree. 
c. ?Australian pine. 
d. ?Melaleuca (punk tree). 
(d) ?Credit for new trees and existing trees. 
(1) ?New trees. Credit shall be given for each tree in accordance with the schedule which follows: 
Each new tree must be planted in a landscaped area of not less than 25 square feet. To ensure 
the proper development of the tree's crown, no canopy trees counted as credit shall be planted 
closer than 15 feet on center. Chinese fan and cabbage (sabal) palms counted as credit shall 
be planted with a minimum of two plants to an area. A credit of one tree shall be allowed for 
every two palms. 
(2) ?Existing trees. Existing trees which are retained and preserved shall receive credit against the 
landscape area requirements according to the following schedule:

These credits shall apply where the preserved tree is in a planting area in which the area's least 
dimension is one-half of the radius of the crown spread of a tree up to ten feet, measured from the 
trunk center, and where no substantial grade changes within the landscape area are anticipated. In 
no case shall this least dimension be less than 2½ feet. To receive credit for trees, the applicant 
must submit a site plan locating all existing trees and indicating size and species. All trees retained 
for credit must be protected during all phases of construction, as set forth in subsection (c) of this 
section, pertaining to tree protection. 
(3) ?Ratio of required trees. The ratio of required trees is as follows: 
Canopy trees = 50 percent minimum. 
Understory trees = 50 percent maximum. 
Palms = 15 percent maximum. 
(Code 1981, app. C, § 26-7(6)) 


Sec. 94-296. - Specific landscape requirements. 
(a) ?Buffer zones. 
(1) ?A buffer zone is a landscaped strip along parcel boundaries that serves as a buffer between 
incompatible uses and zoning districts, as an attractive boundary of the parcel or use, or as both 
a buffer and attractive boundary. This shall not be interpreted to mean that parcels within a 
planned mixed use development must meet these requirements. 
(2) ?The width and degree of vegetation required depends on the nature of the adjoining 
thoroughfares and uses. The standards of subsections (a)(3) and (4) of this section prescribe 
the required width and landscaping of all buffer zones. 
(3) ?The standards for buffer zones are set out in the following illustrations that specify the number 
of plants required per 100 linear feet. To determine the total number of plants required, the 
length of each side of the property requiring a buffer shall be divided by 100 and multiplied by 
the number of plants shown in the illustration. The plants shall be spread reasonably evenly 
along the length of the buffer.

(5) ?Buffering for mixed use developments shall be based on the more intense use in the building or 
cluster of buildings. 
(6) ?If a developer proposes to landscape a buffer zone with existing native vegetation, a variance 
from the strict planting requirements of this subsection may be granted by the building 
department if: 
a. ?The variance is necessary to prevent harm to the existing native vegetation; and 
b. ?The buffering and/or aesthetic purposes of the buffer zone are substantially fulfilled despite 
the variance. 
(7) ?Responsibility for providing buffer zones. 
a. ?The desired width of a buffer zone between two parcels is the sum of the required buffer 
zones of the parcels. Where a new use is proposed next to an existing use that has less 
than the required buffer zone for that use, an inadequate buffer zone will be tolerated, 
except as provided in this subsection, until the nonconforming parcel is redeveloped and 
brought into conformity with the buffer zone requirements of this Code. The developer of 
the new adjoining use is encouraged to take into account the inadequacy of the adjoining 
buffer zone in designing the site layout of the new development. 
b. ?Where a residential use is proposed next to an existing nonresidential use, or a 
nonresidential use is proposed next to an existing residential use, and the existing use 
does not have a conforming buffer zone abutting the property proposed for development, 
the proposed use shall provide 80 percent of the combined required buffer zones of the 
two uses. Where the existing use has a buffer zone, but such zone does not meet the 
requirements of this Code, the proposed use may provide less than 80 percent of the 
combined required buffer zones if the provision of such lesser amount will create a buffer 
zone meeting 100 percent of the combined required buffer zone of the two uses. The 
building department shall determine which areas may be counted as buffer zone of the 
existing use based on the buffering qualities of the areas. 
(b) ?Interior landscaping. All parking areas shall have interior landscaping to provide visual and climatic 
relief from broad expanses of pavement, and to direct and define logical areas for pedestrian and 
vehicular circulation. 
(1) ?Off-street parking areas containing five parking spaces or in excess of 1,500 square feet shall 
contain at least ten square feet of interior landscaping for each parking space. Other vehicular 
use areas in excess of 1,000 square feet shall have 25 square feet of landscaped area for each 
500 square feet or fraction thereof of paved area. 
(2) ?Each separate interior landscaped area shall contain a minimum of 100 square feet and shall 
be at least five feet wide. A minimum of one tree shall be planted for every 120 square feet of 
interior landscaping or fraction thereof, with the remaining area adequately planted with shrubs, 
ground cover or other approved landscaping materials. 
(3) ?All interior landscaping shall be protected from vehicle encroachment by curbing or wheel 
stops. 
(4) ?Interior landscaping shall be located in a manner which will divide or interrupt the broad 
expanse of paving. Landscaped areas shall subdivide parking areas into parking bays 
containing a maximum of 50 spaces, provided that no more than 12 spaces shall be in an 
uninterrupted row. 
(5) ?In other vehicular use areas where the strict application of this subsection will seriously limit the 
function of the area, such as off-street loading areas, the required landscaping may be located 
near the perimeter of the paved area. Such required interior landscaping which is relocated 
shall be in addition to the buffer zone requirements. 
(6) ?Interior landscaping layout or design shall be reviewed and approved by the building 
department. 
(c) ?Use of required landscape areas. No accessory structures, garbage or trash collection points or 
receptacles, parking, or any other functional use contrary to the intent and purpose of this Code shall 
be permitted in a required landscape area. This does not prohibit the combining of compatible 
functions such as landscaping and drainage facilities. 
(d) ?Appropriate site plans showing proposed landscape development shall be submitted to the city 
building department. Landscape plans for new nonresidential construction only, excluding 
renovations and additions, shall be prepared by a licensed, Florida registered Landscape Architect or 
other licensed professional authorized by law to practice in the area of landscape design. The site 
plan shall be drawn to scale normally of not less than one inch equals 30 feet. A different scale may 
be permitted for good cause shown. Landscape plan review will typically be done concurrent with 
building permit application review. Amendments or modifications to approved landscape plans shall 
be reviewed administratively within five working days. Such site plan shall include the following: 
(1) ?Plant name, size and location, number, spacing and size upon installation of all trees, shrubs 
and ground covers. 
(2) ?Existing and proposed landscape areas. 
(3) ?Existing and proposed parking areas, including access aisles, driveways, catchbasins and all 
vehicular use areas, scaled and/or dimensioned. 
(4) ?An irrigation system, including heads, valves and pump, that provides 100 percent coverage. 
(5) ?Locations of all existing and/or proposed structures, sidewalks, pools, fences and walls, all 
applicable utilities services, dumpsters and other improvements, properly dimensioned and 
referenced to property uses, setback and yard requirements. 
(e) ?Sight distance for landscaping adjacent to public right-of-way and points of access. When an 
accessway intersects a public right-of-way, all landscaping shall provide unobstructed cross-visibility 
at a level between 2½ and ten feet high within the areas of property on both sides of an accessway 
formed by the intersection of each side of the accessway and public right-of-way lines, with two sides 
of such triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line 
connecting the ends of the two other sides; provided that trees having limbs and foliage trimmed in 
such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into the cross visibility area shall be allowed, provided 
they are located so as not to create a traffic hazard. Landscaping, except required grass or ground 
cover, shall not be located closer than three feet to the edge of any accessway pavement. 
(f) ?Corner visibility. On a corner lot in any residential district, no hedge, structure or planting, or other 
obstruction to vision between the heights of 2½ feet and ten feet above street level shall be erected, 
placed or maintained within the triangular area formed by the intersection of curblines and a straight 
line joining the curblines at points which are 30 feet distant from the point of intersection measured 
along the curblines. 
(g) ?Appeals. A person aggrieved by an administrative order, determination or decision of the building 
department may appeal the order, determination or decision to the board of zoning appeals for a 
variance from the strict requirements of this section.

Sec. 94-302. - Applicability of regulations. 
    This article shall apply to projects meeting at least one of the following criteria: 
(a) ?All appropriately-zoned lots existing on the date of adoption of this article requiring a building 
permit and proposed for development shall conform to this article as follows (for the provisions 
of this paragraph, commencement of development shall be defined as the date of the initial 
issuance of the building permit excluding extensions): 
(1) ?Certificate of occupancy issued within 12 months of adoption of this article: 50 percent 
compliance. 
(2) ?Certificate of occupancy issued after 12 months but within 18 months of adoption of this 
article: 75 percent compliance. 
(3) ?Certificate of occupancy issued after 18 months of adoption of this article: 100 percent 
compliance. 
This criterion does not apply to fences, only to the quantity of plantings and the width of the 
buffer. 
(b) ?A change in land use or zoning shall be subject to this article. For purposes of this article, a 
change in land use or zoning shall include any of the following: 
(1) ?A future land use amendment; 
(2) ?A rezoning; or 
(3) ?A conditional use. 
This criterion does not apply to a change of occupancy or use where such change is permitted 
within the subject zoning designation without any additional consideration or process. 
(c) ?Additions or expansions to existing uses shall be governed as follows: 
(1) ?On sites two acres or smaller, additions or expansions greater than 5,000 square feet

(2) ?On sites greater than two acres, additions or expansions greater than 10,000 square feet 
to an existing structure shall be subject to this article. This includes additions cumulatively 
totaling more than 10,000 square feet following the adoption of this article. 
(3) ?Additions or expansions less than 100 feet from any property line shall provide the 
required buffer on the encroached upon property line(s). 
(4) ?Additions or expansions more than 100 feet from any property line shall be exempt, 
except on property lines that abut parcels zoned R-1AA, R-1A, R-1, or R-2. 
(5) ?Buffers shall extend between building lines. 
(d) ?For purposes of clearing or grading, the owner shall be required to follow at a minimum the 
standards set forth herein and the standards of stabilization as set forth by the public works 
director and other appropriate authorities. The installation of buffers shall not be required until a 
certificate of occupancy is requested for the developed parcels and at that time only the buffer 
for each developed parcel should be required. This shall ensure that the proper buffer is 
established for each use as well as provide for the appropriate timing of installation. 
(e) ?Redevelopment of a site, as defined in this article, shall be subject to this article and shall 
additionally include any subsequent redevelopment cumulatively totaling more than a 50 
percent expansion following the adoption of the article. 
(f) ?In instances where a property owner or his agent is in possession of multiple contiguous 
undeveloped lots or parcels with differing zoning, or in instances where a single undeveloped lot 
or parcel includes multiple zoning designations, then the property owner may exclude the 
required buffers separating these differing zonings until such time as development is 
commenced, the contiguous use is initiated, or until a certificate of occupancy is requested for 
the adjacent undeveloped lot or parcel or portion of a lot or parcel with differing zoning 
designations. In instances where a contiguous lot or parcel with differing zoning, or where a 
portion of a lot or parcel with differing zoning, is sold by a property owner and the required 
buffer has not been previously installed, then the required buffer shall immediately be required 
to be installed by the property owner. In no instance shall this exclusion be used by a property 
owner to intentionally avoid the installation of a required buffer and, further, the zoning 
administrator reserves the right to require the installation of buffers where in his opinion a 
property owner is attempting to intentionally avoid the installation of the required buffers. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § I, 6-23-2005)

Sec. 94-303. - Buffer determination. 
    To determine the type of buffer required between two adjacent parcels, refer to the table of buffer 
requirements and cross-reference the zoning of the parcel proposed for development, redevelopment, or 
expansion with the zoning district of the adjacent parcel, regardless of whether it is developed or vacant, 
except as provided in section 94-302(f). The standards provided are minimum requirements and may be 
exceeded if so desired, except for fence heights, which shall require approval of the board of zoning 
appeals to be exceeded.

Sec. 94-305. - Buffer requirements for street frontages. 
    The portion(s) of a parcel proposed for development, redevelopment, or expansion abutting on a 
public street or highway right-of-way shall be buffered as per Table 94-305. 
    Buffers may be planted within the public right-of-way and utility easements if the public works 
director concludes that such plantings will not be impacted by utilities, roadway expansions, or traffic flow 
considerations. Planting within the right-of-way and utility easements may account for no more than 25 
percent of the total landscape requirement. Parcels zoned R-1AA, R-1A, R-1, and R-2 are exempt from 
this requirement.

Berms shall have a maximum slope of 3:1, a minimum crown width of two feet, and shall be planted 
with vegetative ground cover to prevent erosion. 
Fence installation shall be consistent with acceptable building practices. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § I, 6-23-2005) 
_____


Sec. 94-306. - Location of buffers. 
    Buffers shall be located along the perimeter of a lot or parcel, and may be located within the public 
right-of-way or utility easement as provided for in section 94-305. If fencing is required, or desired, it shall 
be located at the property line. A fence shall be erected so the best aesthetic surface faces the adjacent 
property. 
    Buffers may be located within the front, rear and side yard required by the zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § I, 6-23-2005) 


Sec. 94-307. - Planting specifications. 
(a) ?General requirements. All plant material shall meet American Association of Nurserymen Standards. 
Plantings shall conform to the following specifications, as applicable: 
(1) ?Ground cover of vegetative matter shall be provided throughout the buffer area except in 
undisturbed natural vegetation areas. If grass is used, it shall be of a species normally grown as 
permanent lawns in the vicinity of Palatka, Florida. Grass areas may be sodded, plugged, 
sprigged or seeded. 
(2) ?Canopy tree species shall be a minimum of eight feet in height and have a caliper of at least 
two inches immediately after planting. Species shall have an average mature crown spread of at 
least 25 feet when grown in Palatka, Florida. No canopy trees shall be planted within 20 feet of 
overhead wires. 
(3) ?Understory tree species shall be a minimum of five feet in height and have a caliper of at least 
1½ inches immediately after planting. Species used shall have an average mature crown 
spread of at least 15 feet when grown in Palatka, Florida. 
(4) ?Shrubs and ornamental grasses shall be a minimum of 12 inches in height when measured 
immediately after planting. 
(5) ?Shrubs or ornamental grasses planted to form hedges shall be an evergreen species and a 
minimum of 18 inches in height when measured immediately after planting. Shrubs and 
ornamental grasses planted to form hedges shall be planted no further apart than 30 inches on 
center. 
(6) ?All plantings that die or are destroyed within two years must be replaced. 
(b) ?Specific requirements. 
(1) ?Placement, installation and irrigation. 
a. ?To achieve a more natural appearance, plantings should not be evenly spaced or planted 
in a straight line. Plantings shall be distributed throughout the length of the buffer. 
b. ?Plantings shall be installed to current nursery industry standards. Plant materials shall be 
properly supported to ensure survival. Support devices such as guy wires or stakes shall 
not interfere with vehicular or pedestrian movement and shall be removed after 12 months. 
c. ?The buffer shall provide for the placement of topsoil of a depth sufficient to ensure plant 
survival. 
d. ?To ensure that plants will survive the critical establishment period when they are most 
vulnerable due to lack of watering, all buffer areas should be provided with means of 
providing water with one of the following two options: 
1. ?A permanent built-in irrigation system; or 
2. ?A temporary watering system (hoses, water tank truck, etc.) which provides sufficient 
water to ensure that selected plant species can survive adequately on their own once 
established. 
(2) ?Existing vegetation. Preservation of existing stands of natural vegetation and mature trees is a 
highly desirable aspect of site development and encouraged whenever and wherever existing 
vegetation will aid in meeting the requirements of this article. 
a. ?As noted in the buffer category schedule, undisturbed natural vegetation can serve as an 
adequate buffer and can eliminate the need for any supplemental vegetation within the 
buffer areas. All such areas must be adequately protected during site development and 
construction activity. 
b. ?Mature trees are valuable community assets and should be saved whenever possible. If 
existing trees (hardwoods or pines) at least eight inches in diameter (measured four feet 
above the ground) are used in the buffer or landscaped area, each tree will count double 
toward meeting the buffer tree requirement. 
(3) ?Protection. All required buffer areas, particularly those including trees and shrubs, should be 
protected from potential damage by adjacent uses and development, including parking and 
storage areas. A tree protection device shall be installed at the dripline of the tree canopy to 
protect the tree and root zone. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § I, 6-23-2005) 


Sec. 94-308. - Responsibility for installation and maintenance. 
    The property owner or his/her agent is responsible for the installation and reasonable maintenance 
of the buffer area. Succeeding owners, lessees, and agents must also reasonably maintain the buffers. 
The penalty for failing to install or maintain the required buffer areas is outlined in the administration and 
enforcement section of this article, except that in R-1AA, R-1A, R-1, and R-2 zoning districts, 
maintenance of any buffer shall be at the discretion of the individual homeowner following installation of 
any buffer during initial development of the site. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § I, 6-23-2005) 


Sec. 94-309. - Timing of buffer installation. 
    Required buffers shall be installed in accordance with the following schedule: 
(1) ?New development, redevelopment, or expansions: Dimensions, category and option of buffer 
installation shall be submitted to the building department prior to the issuance of a certificate of 
occupancy. 
(2) ?Change in land use or zoning: site plans submitted with the future land use amendment, 
rezoning, or conditional use application shall depict the location, dimensions, category, and 
option of required buffers and buffer installation and shall be submitted to the building 
department as part of the application submittal for the requested change in land use or zoning. 
No change in land use or zoning may be heard by the planning board without the submittal of 
site plans addressing required buffers as provided in this article. 
(3) ?Where a buffer includes new plantings, a property owner or developer may submit an affidavit 
requesting a postponement in planting to allow for installation to occur at a time which better 
coincides with the normal planting season, generally between November 1 and March 30 of 
each year. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § I, 6-23-2005) 


Sec. 94-310. - Exceptions and modifications. 
(a) ?Central business district. Because of the unique urban character of the central business district 
(CBD), the buffering requirements of this article shall not apply to properties located within the CBD 
zoned DB (downtown business) or DR (downtown riverfront). However, properties in the CBD shall 
be subject to the "screening required for parking lots" and "screening required for trash areas, 
dumpsters, and outdoor storage areas visible from any public street or from residential uses and 
zones" portions of this article. 
(b) ?All other development including all city- and government-owned property, school district property, 
etc. shall comply. 
(c) ?Modifications to the standards of this article may be granted in writing within ten working days by the 
zoning administrator if any of the following circumstances exist on the proposed building site, or 
adjacent properties: 
(1) ?Natural land characteristics, such as topography or existing vegetation on the proposed 
building site, would achieve the same intent of this article. 
(2) ?Innovative buffering or architectural design is employed on the building site to achieve an 
equivalent screening or buffering effect. 
    The developer shall submit sufficient documentation in support of the request for modification to the 
zoning administrator a minimum of 60 days in advance of requesting issuance of a site development 
permit. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § I, 6-23-2005) 


Sec. 94-311. - Screening required for trash areas, dumpsters and outdoor storage areas visible from any 
public street or from residential uses and zones. 
    Trash areas, dumpsters and outdoor storage areas visible from any public street or from residential 
uses and zones shall be screened with plants, opaque fencing, or masonry walls on three sides in such a 
manner as to provide a minimum of six feet, but no more than eight feet, of vertical visual obstruction. 
This section shall not apply to parcels zoned R-1AA, R-1A, R-1, and R-2. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § I, 6-23-2005) 


Sec. 94-312. - Variances. 
    The board of zoning appeals may hear requests for variances from provisions of this article in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in division 2 of article II of chapter 94. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § I, 6-23-2005) 


Sec. 94-313. - Administration and enforcement. 
(a) ?Administration. In projects involving issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy, the 
planning director shall receive an affidavit executed by the property owner or developer 
acknowledging the completion of, or commitment of completing by a certain date, the buffer 
installation prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
    In instances where the buffer installation has not taken place prior to issuance of the certificate of 
occupancy, then a performance bond or other acceptable surety in an amount equal to 110 percent of the 
value of the buffer, as determined by the planning director, and its installation shall be posted with the 
building and zoning department. This performance bond or other acceptable surety shall remain in full 
effect until the required improvements are installed, inspected, and approved for release by the planning 
director or his designee. 
(b) ?Appeals. The board of zoning appeals may hear requests for appeals in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in section 94-65 of this chapter. 
(c) ?Enforcement. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate or fail to comply with any provision of this 
article. Violators shall be subject to the penalties as set forth herein. A violation of this article shall 
constitute a Class II offense as listed in the city's uniform fine schedule, with multiple violations 
carrying a fine not to exceed $500.00. Additionally, provisions of this article may be enforced by the 
code enforcement board following the procedures listed in article V of chapter 2 of the Municipal 
Code. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § I, 6-23-2005; Ord. No. 11-60, § 1, 10-13-2011) 


Sec. 94-314. - Severability and conflict. 
(a) ?Severability. This article, and its various parts, are hereby declared to severable. If any section, 
clause, provision, or portion of this article is declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of this article as a whole. All parts 
not declared invalid or unconstitutional shall remain in full force and effect. 
(b) ?Conflict. If any part of this article is found to be in conflict with any other ordinance or any other part 
of this article or chapter, the most restrictive or highest standard shall prevail. If any part of this article 
is explicitly prohibited by federal or state statute, it shall not be enforced.

average monthly consumption for the previous 12 months by a minimum of 10,000 gallons. 
Customers who experience unusually high-water usage with a corresponding spike in their 
monthly water bill may be considered for a billing adjustment after completing the appropriate 
form titled "Leak Adjustment Request Form" within 30 days after (1) notification of possible leak 
concern by Palatka Gas Authority OR (2) the customer has detected an issue and has repaired 
it. An Adjustment is available no more than once in a 12-month period per customer account. All 
customers requesting a billing adjustment are required to be current on all accounts. 
To apply for an adjustment, the customer must submit a copy of the repair invoice/payment 
receipt from company performing the work. The repair invoice/payment receipt should include 
the address, date and nature of the work. If self-repaired, the customer must provide a brief 
written explanation of the repairs performed and provide copies of invoice/receipt for repair 
parts. If repairs have not been completed, no adjustment will be made. The customer's prior 
average consumption usage over a period of 12 months will be compared to customer's usage 
during the unexplained high-water usage period to determine excessive water usage to by 
adjusted. For customers with less than 12 months water usage, staff will extrapolate 12 months 
of usage. The adjustment will be applied to the highest single month's usage during the 
unusually high usage period. Calculation for adjustment will be 50% of the difference between 
the customer's highest monthly usage and their average usage.
