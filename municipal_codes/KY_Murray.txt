of Murray, specifically the Historic District, the educational, cultural,
economic and general welfare of the community.



   (B)   Having the Council provide a mechanism to identify and
preserve the distinctive historic and architectural characteristics of
Murray, specifically the Historic District, which represent the city's

   (C)   The Council finds that the historic and architectural
character of Murray is of vital importance in maintaining the economy of the
city.



   (D)   The Council finds that Murray plays an important role in the

and growth that made the city what it is today. The Council finds that the
city has buildings representing the people who live in Murray now as well as
those who lived in Murray for a period of over 100 years. It is the finding
of the Council that the distinctive and significant character of Murray can
only be maintained by protecting and enhancing its historical, architectural
and cultural heritage and by preventing unnecessary injury to its historic
districts and its landmarks which are a civic and community asset.



   (E)   The Council funds that the Federal and Kentucky Governments
have passed laws to protect historic districts and landmarks and that the
National Historic Preservation Act was amended in 1980 to establish a
Certified Local Government program creating a new federal-state-local
partnership to encourage the efforts by cities to protect and preserve their
historic districts and landmarks.



   (F)   The Council finds that the adoption of an Ordinance to provide
a historic preservation program within the Historic District will benefit all
the residents of Murray and all the owners of property.



   (G)   The Council declares as a matter of public policy that the
preservation, protection, and use of historic districts and landmarks are a
public benefit because they have special character and historic,
architectural and cultural value and thus serve as visible reminders of the
history and heritage of the city, state and nation. The Council declares as a
matter of public policy that this subchapter is required in the interest of
the health, prosperity, safety, welfare and economic well-being of the people.



   (H)   The Council finds that the Main Street program has contributed
to the revival of the central business district of Murray, that it has
increased the awareness of the value of the older buildings in the city and
that the historic preservation program will strengthen the current
revitalization work in the city.



   (I)   The purpose of this subchapter is to effect the goals as set
forth in the above findings and declarations of public policy and
specifically, but not exclusively, to:



      (1)   Effect and accomplish the preservation and protection in
the historic districts of Murray which have a special character and historic,
architectural and cultural value to the city, state and nation;



      (2)   Promote the educational, cultural, economic and general
welfare of the people and safeguard the city's history and heritage embodied
and reflected in its historic districts and landmarks in the City of Murray;



      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values in such districts
and in the city as a whole;



      (4)   Foster civic pride in the value of notable
accomplishments of the past;



      (5)   Strengthen the economy of the city;



      (6)   Protect and enhance the city's attractions to residents
and visitors; and



      (7)   Enhance the visual and aesthetic character, diversity
and interest of the city.

§ 32.69  APPROVAL OF CHANGES TO LANDMARKS AND PROPERTY IN HISTORIC
DISTRICTS.



   (A)   Requirement for Certificate of Appropriateness.  A
Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required before a person may
undertake the following actions affecting a landmark or a property in an
historic district:



      (1)   Alteration of the exterior part of a building or
structure that is visible to the public;



      (2)   New construction;



      (3)   Demolition; or



      (4)   Relocation.



   A Certificate of Appropriateness is required even when the proposed
work does not require a building permit.



   (B)   Application process. 



      (1)   An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness may
be obtained from the City of Murray Planning Department.  City staff and/or
Murray Main Street Manager will meet with the applicant regarding the
application process and guidelines to ensure completion of application.  In
addition to the application, applicant shall provide drawings of the proposed
work, photographs of the existing building or site and adjacent properties,
and information about the building materials to be used.  All applications
will be reviewed by the Board at a public hearing, except for those
applications proposing exterior alterations to a structure or property that
meet the criteria as designated in the city Design guidelines.  The Board
shall grant the city staff and/or Murray Main Street Manager authority to
review and issue a certificate of appropriateness for such applications.



      (2)   Stop work order. In the event work is being performed
without the required Certificate of Appropriateness, the Board or City
Official shall direct the Building Inspector to issue a Stop Work Order. All
work shall cease on the designated property until a certificate of
appropriateness has been issued.



   (C)   Action by the Architectural Review Board: notice. Once a
completed Certificate of Appropriateness application has been received the
Board shall hold a public hearing to consider the request. Notice of the
public hearing shall be given at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the
public hearing by first class mail to all surrounding property owners along
with a notice of the hearing by publication in the Murray Ledger and Times in
Murray. Kentucky not less than seven (7) days nor more than twenty-one (21)
days prior to the public hearing. At the public hearing, the Board shall
consider the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness by examining the
staff report, and hearing testimony of the applicant, and interested citizens
speaking in favor or in opposition of the proposed changes. The Board shall
consider: (1) the effect of the proposed work on the landmark or the property
in the historic district upon which such work is to be done, and (2) the
relationship between such work and other adjacent or nearby buildings and
property. In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the Board shall
consider historical and architectural significance, architectural style,
design, texture of materials and color and may suggest modifications to the
application. The Certificate of Appropriateness issued by the Board shall not
relieve the applicant from complying with the requirements of other state and
local laws and regulations. The Board shall vote to approve or disapprove all
or a part of the application within ninety (90) days after the completed
application is filed. If the application is approved city staff shall then
issue the Certificate of Appropriateness and the applicant may apply for a
building permit (if applicable) to begin work. If the application is
disapproved, the Board shall notify the applicant in writing the reasons for
such disapproval. The applicant may not reapply for the same request for a
period of six (6) months from the date of action taken by the Board unless
otherwise noted.



   (D)   Routine Alterations: Ordinary Maintenance and Repairs. 



      (1)   The Board may prepare a list of routine alterations that
may receive immediate approval without a public hearing, when an applicant
complies with the written guidelines of the Board. At each meeting the Board
shall be informed of the Certificates of Appropriateness that have been
issued under this provision. The Board shall not regulate the color of paint
used on designated property, but it may prepare and distribute material on
paint colors appropriate for different types and styles of buildings.



      (2)   Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken
without a Certificate of Appropriateness provided this work on a landmark or
a property in an historic district does not change its exterior appearance
that is visible to the public. Every person in charge of a landmark or a
property in an historic district shall keep it in good repair: (1) all of the
exterior portions of such buildings or structures; and (2) all interior
portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause such buildings or
structures to deteriorate or to become damaged or otherwise to fall into a
state of disrepair. The purpose of this provision is to prevent a person from
forcing the demolition of his building by neglecting it and by permitting
damage to the building because of weather or vandalism.



      (3)   No provision in this subchapter shall be interpreted to
require an owner or tenant to undertake an alteration or to restore his
building to its original appearance. The provisions of this section shall be
in addition to the provisions of the Kentucky Building Code requiring
buildings and structures to be kept in good repair.



   (E)   Meetings with owners about condition of buildings.  The Board
shall request a meeting with a property owner when his landmark or his
building in an historic district is in poor repair, and the Board shall
discuss with the owner ways to improve the condition of his property. After
this step, the Board may request the Building Inspector to take action to
require correction of defects in conflict with the city's building code and
property maintenance code any building or structure designated under this
subchapter so that such building or structure shall be preserved in
accordance with the purposes of the subchapter. Action taken by the city may
include boarding up the doors, windows, and other parts of the building and
additional steps to stabilize walls, roofs and other parts of the building or
structure.



   (F)   Emergency situations.  In any case where the Building
Inspector determines that there are emergency conditions dangerous to life,
health or property affecting a landmark or a property in an historic
district, he may order the remedying of these conditions without the approval
of the Board. When it is possible, he shall consult with the Chairman or Vice
Chairman of the Board about the action being taken. If consultation is not
possible, the city shall notify the Board of the action taken after the
completion of the work.



   (G)   Demolition of a landmark or a building or structure in an
historic district.  When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark or a
building or structure in an historic district, the Board shall negotiate with
the applicant to see if an alternative to demolition can be found. The Board
may ask interested individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an
alternative to demolition and in obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs
for the threatened building. After its public hearing, the Board may decide
that the building or  structure in an historic district may be demolished
because it does not contribute  to the historic district. On all other
demolition applications, the Board shall study  the question of economic
hardship for the applicant and shall determine whether the landmark or the
property in the historic district can be put to reasonable  beneficial use
without the approval of the demolition application. In the case of an income
- producing building, the Board shall also determine whether the  applicant
can obtain a reasonable return from his building. The Board may ask
applicants for additional information to be used in making these
determinations.  If economic hardship or the lack of a reasonable return is
not proved, the Board shall deny the demolition application unless the Board
finds grounds to grant the demolition application under the points contained
in § 32.68(A) through (D).



   (H)   Moving a landmark or a building or structure in an historic
district. When applicant wishes to move a landmark or a building or structure
in a historic district or when an  applicant wishes to move a building or
structure to a lot containing a landmark or to a property in an historic
district, the Board shall  consider:



      (1)    The contribution the building or structure makes to the
present setting;



      (2)    Whether there are definite plans for the site to be
vacated;



      (3)    Whether the building or structure can be moved without
significant damage to its physical integrity; and



      (4)    The compatibility of the building or structure to its
proposed site and adjacent properties. These considerations shall be in
additions to the points contained in § 32.68(A) through (D).



   (I)   Length of validity of certificate of appropriateness. A
Certificate of Appropriateness shall remain valid for six (6) months after it
is issued. Work is required to begin before the end of the six (6) month
period. Actual work is hereby defined to include the placing of construction
materials in a permanent position  and fastened in a permanent manner. Where
excavation or demolition is required preparatory to rebuilding, such
excavation or demolition shall be deemed to be actual work provided that
shall be carried out diligently.



   (J)   Appeal of the Board's decision. The applicant shall have a
right to appeal a  decision by the Board to the City Council on any request
to amend the original designated boundaries or an application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness, within thirty (30) days of the action of the
Board.

be punitive nor to cause hardship upon those individuals and concerns
exercising reasonable care and diligence to protect these trees.  The
objective of the subchapter is to establish a comprehensive tree program
along major arterials and on all publicly owned property to make the city a
healthier and more beautiful community in which to live.

PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS



§ 36.05  INITIAL REQUEST WITH IMMEDIATE INSPECTION.



   (A)   As defined in § 36.01, and subject to the limitations set
forth in § 36.12, any person desiring to inspect or copy the public records
of the city shall make a request or complete a written application for such
records at the office of the City Clerk during regular office hours, except
during legal holidays.  The application shall be hand delivered, mailed, or
sent via facsimile to the City Clerk's office.



(KRS 61.872 (2))



   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person's request is in
compliance with the open records law and the requested records are
immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection.  Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of
the City Clerk for the inspection.  No person shall remove original copies
of public records from the offices of any public agency without the written
permission of the official custodian of the record. 



(KRS 61.872(1).



   (C)   An applicant may inspect public records during the regular
business hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from
the city through the mail if the applicant's residence or principal place of
business is outside of the county in which the city is located and he has
precisely described public records which are available within the city. If
the person requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed,
the official custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the
cost of mailing.  KRS 61.872(3).



   (D)   The applicant shall have  the right to make  abstracts of
the public records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by
this chapter.  When copies are requested, the custodian may require a
written request and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
36.01. 



(KRS 61.874(1))



   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall
be available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format.  Agencies are not
required to convert hard copy format records to electronic formats.



   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as
not less than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white
paper, or for electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard
Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format.  If the public agency
maintains electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this
format conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records may be
provided in this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified
by the public agency.  Any request for a public record in a form other than
the forms described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized
request.



(KRS 61.874(1))



   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the
disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial
purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial
purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee.  The public
agency from which copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a
commercial purpose may require a certified statement from the requestor
stating the commercial purpose for which  they shall be used, and may
require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency.  The
contract shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial
purpose for a specified fee.  The fee may be based on the cost to the public
agency of media, mechanical processing and staff required to produce a copy
of the public record or records or the cost to the public agency of the
creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public records.



(KRS 61.874 (4))



   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part
of a public record for a:



      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial
purpose, if a certified statement from the  requestor was required by the
public agency pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or



      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly
allows the use of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or



      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly
allows the use of the public record for a commercial purpose.  A newspaper,
periodical, radio or television station shall not be held to have used or
knowingly allowed the use of the public record for a commercial purpose
merely because of its publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its
express permission for that commercial use.



(KRS 61.874 (5))



   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as
provided under this section, may be provided and made available at the
discretion of the public agency.  If a party wishes to access public records
by electronic means and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a
public agency may require that the party enter into a contract, license, or
other agreement with the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. 
Fees shall not exceed:



      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and
reasonable cost of computer time access charges;



      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a
reasonable fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).

or records requested, the City Clerk shall so notify the applicant and shall
furnish the name and location of the custodian of the public record.



(KRS 61.872(4))



§ 36.07  PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.



   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant
and shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public
records, not to exceed three days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays) from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of
the cause is given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date
on which the public record will be available for inspection or duplication.



(KRS 61.872(5))



§ 36.08  REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.



   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records.  However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence. 



(KRS 61.872(6))



§ 36.09  TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.



   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made
under this chapter, shall determine within three (3) days, excepting
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request
whether to comply with the request and shall notify in writing the person
making the request within the three-day period of its decision.  Any agency
response denying, in whole or in part, inspection of any record shall include
a statement of the specific exception authorizing the withholding of the
record  and a brief explanation of how the exception applies to the record
withheld.  The response shall be issued by the official custodian or under
the official custodian's authority and shall constitute final agency action.



(KRS 61.880)



   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review
the denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed
under the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882.  Upon the Attorney General's
request, the agency will provide additional documentation.



   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney
General reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole
or in part, the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute
appeal proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory
relief in the circuit court.  In addition, if the Attorney General disallows
the request, or if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding
the Attorney General's opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes
proceedings in circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of
such action. 



(KRS 61.880, 61.882)



§ 36.10  CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.

§ 36.12  PUBLIC RECORDS PROTECTED FROM DISCLOSURE.



   (A)   The following public records are excluded from the application
of this chapter and these rules and regulations, and shall be subject to
inspection only upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction, except that
no court shall authorize the inspection by any party of any materials
pertaining to civil litigation beyond that which is provided by the Rules of

   All procurements made by the city, involving the expenditure of
Kentucky Community Development Block Grant Funds will be made in accordance
with the following procurement standards.



(Ord. 85-817, passed 11-27-85)



§ 37.02  MAXIMIZATION OF FREE AND OPEN COMPETITION.



   Procurement transactions, regardless of method or dollar value, will
maximize open and free competition.  The city shall not engage in
procurement practices which may be considered restrictive in trade.



(Ord. 85-817, passed 11-27-85)



§ 37.03  REVIEW BY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING AND ZONING.



   Purchases will be reviewed by the Director of Planning and Zoning to
prevent duplication and to insure that costs are reasonable.

§ 37.04  CONTRACTS.



   Generally, all procurement in excess of $200 will be memorialized and

prepare a contract, a written finding to this effect will be prepared and
some form of documentation regarding the transaction will also be prepared. 
The contractual provisions required by OMB Circular A-102, Attachment "O"
will be included in all contracts.



(Ord. 85-817, passed 11-27-85)  Penalty, see § 37.99

data, and bid materials) will be retained and filed in an appropriate
manner.  Where feasible, source documents pertinent to each individual
procurement shall be separately filed and maintained.  Where it is feasible
to maintain individual procurement files, source documents will be filed and
maintained in a reasonable manner (examples include chronologically, by
vendor, by type of procurement, and the like).  Whatever form of
documentation and filing is employed, the purpose of this section is to
insure that a clear and consistent audit trail is established.  At a
minimum, source document data must be sufficient to establish the basis for
selection, basis for cost (including the issue of reasonableness of cost),
and basis for payment.

§ 37.06  LOCALLY OWNED, MINORITY OWNED, AND FEMALE OWNED BUSINESSES.



   Efforts will be made and documented to solicit participation of locally
owned, minority owned, and female owned businesses.  Where feasible,

these firms.  A list of locally owned, minority and female owned businesses,
and minority businesses located within the trade region shall be maintained
and utilized when issuing invitations for bids, requests for proposals, and
requests for qualifications.  This list shall also be consulted when making
small purchases.

PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES

least three vendors, and if no such responses are available, a statement
explaining the procurement will be prepared and filed.



   (B)   Purchases which cost between $50 and $200 require three
over-the-telephone quotations of rate, price, and the like.  A memorandum
will be prepared setting forth the date the calls were made, parties
contacted, and prices obtained.  For purchases of less than $50, efforts
will be made to get the lowest and best price, but written records of such
efforts are not necessary.



(Ord. 85-817, passed 11-27-85)  Penalty, see § 37.99

   (A)   Bidding will be employed when detailed specifications for the
goods or services to be procured can be prepared and the primary basis for
award is cost.  When the cost of a contract, lease, or other agreement for
materials, supplies, equipment, or contractual services other than those
personal or professional exceeds $7,500, an invitation for bids notice will
generally be prepared.  This notice will be published at least once in at
least one official newspaper of general circulation within the community. 
This newspaper notice will appear not less than seven days and not more than
2l days before the due date for bid proposals.  The Mayor may also solicit
sealed bids from responsible prospective suppliers by sending them a copy of
such notice.



   (B)   The invitation for bids will include a general description of
the goods or services to be procured, the bid deposit and bond performance
required (if applicable), the location where bid forms and specifications may
be secured, the time and place for opening bids, and whether the bid award
will be made on the basis of the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated
price.  If the lowest evaluated price is used, the measurable criteria to be
utilized must be stated in the invitation for bids.  The newspaper notice
must also contain language which calls to the attention of the bidders all
applicable requirements which must be complied with such as Section 3 of the
1968 Housing Act, Section 109 of the 1974 Housing and Community Development
Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11246, and the Davis-Bacon
Act.



   (C)   In addition to price, the following are bid evaluation
criteria which may be used with varying weight dependent upon the particular
procurement to be made.  The criteria and their weights will be established
by the invitation for bids.



      (1)   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment,
experience, and efficiency of the contractor.



      (2)   The ability of the vendor to provide the material or
service promptly or within the time specified, without delay or interference.



      (3)   The quality of performance by the vendor on previous
contracts, orders, or services.



      (4)   The ability of the vendor to provide future maintenance
and service for all equipment purchased from the vendor.



   (D)   The criteria upon which a bid will be awarded will be
established by a review committee which will include, if possible, persons
with applicable technical skills.  The Mayor will appoint the reviewers,
making certain that these individuals have no potential conflicts of interest
with the firms or individuals under review.  The committee will have no less
than three members.  The committee will maintain written records of its
deliberations including an evaluation of each bid received.



   (E)   Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place
stated in the invitation for bids.  The bids will be tabulated by the City
Clerk at the time of bid opening.  The results of the tabulation and the bid
documents will be evaluated by the review committee which will make
recommendations to the City Council.  The City Council will make the
decision as to whom the contract shall be awarded.  After the bid award is
made by the City Council, a contract will be prepared for execution by the
successful bidder.  After the contract is signed, all bid deposits will be
returned to all unsuccessful bidders.



   (F)   The city may cancel an invitation for bid or reject all bids
if it is determined in writing that such is in the best interests of the
city.  The city may allow a vendor to withdraw a bid if requested at any
time prior to the bid opening.  Bids received after the time set for bid
opening shall be returned to the vendor unopened.

§ 37.18  COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATIONS.



   (A)   The city will utilize competitive negotiations, regardless of
contract amount, upon a written determination that:



      (1)   Specifications cannot be made specific enough to permit
the award of a bid on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the lowest
evaluated bid price; in other words, bidding is not feasible.



      (2)   The services to be procured are professional or personal
in nature.



   (B)   With the exception of procurement of certain professional
services (principally engineering services), competitive negotiations will
proceed as follows:



      (1)   Proposals will be solicited through newspaper
advertisement; additionally, a request for proposal may be prepared and
mailed to qualified vendors.  The newspaper advertisement must be published
at least seven days and not more than 21 days before the date for receipt of
the proposals.  The request for proposal will describe services needed and
identify the factors to be considered in the evaluation of proposals and the
relative weights assigned to each selection factor.  The request for
proposal will also state where further details regarding the request for
proposals may be obtained.  The request for proposal will call attention to
the same regulations discussed in the bidding process.  Requests for
proposals will always include cost as a selection factor.



      (2)   Award must be made to the offeror whose proposal is
determined in writing by a review committee to be the most advantageous to
the city.  Evaluations must be based on the factors set forth in the request
for proposal and a written evaluation of each response prepared.  The review
committee may contact the firms regarding their proposals for the purpose of
clarification.  If it is determined that no acceptable proposal has been
submitted, all proposals may be rejected.  New proposals may be solicited on
the same or revised terms or the procurement may be abandoned.



   (C)   For the procurement of certain professional services, an
alternative to request for proposals may be used.  The city may publish a
request for qualifications.  Requests for qualifications are handled in a
similar method to request for proposals with the exception that cost is not a
factor in the initial evaluation.  A review committee will evaluate the
responses and rank them by comparative qualifications.  The highest scoring
person or firm will be contracted and the selection committee will negotiate
cost.  If the committee is unable to negotiate a satisfactory cost
arrangement, the second highest scoring person or firm will be invited to
negotiate.  The committee will maintain a written record of all such
negotiations.

§ 37.19  NONCOMPETITIVE NEGOTIATIONS.



   (A)   Noncompetitive negotiations may be used for procurements in
excess of $7,500 when bidding or competitive negotiations are not feasible. 
The city may purchase goods and services through noncompetitive negotiations
when it is determined in writing by the Mayor that competitive negotiation or
bidding is not feasible and that:



      (1)   An emergency exists which will cause public harm as a
result of the delay caused by following competitive purchasing procedures; or



      (2)   The product or service can be obtained only from one
source; or



      (3)   The contract is for the purchase of perishable items
purchased on a weekly or more frequent basis; or



      (4)   Only one satisfactory proposal is received through
request for proposals or request for qualifications; or



      (5)   The state has authorized the particular type of
noncompetitive negotiation (for example, the procurement of services by an
Area Development District).



   (B)   Procurement by noncompetitive negotiation requires the
strictest attention to the observation of impartiality toward all
suppliers.  The Office of Community Development must approve all
procurements by noncompetitive negotiation when only one supplier is involved
or only one bid or response to a request for proposal/request for
qualifications is received.

record of the City Council or city agency before the contract is executed.

agency and not primarily for the benefit of the officer or employee or any
other person.

   The following requirements shall govern all enforcement proceedings
before the Board:



   (A)   Enforcement proceedings before the Code Enforcement Board
shall only be initiated by the issuance of a citation by a Code Enforcement
Officer. After issuing a citation to an offender, a Code Enforcement Officer
shall notify the Code Enforcement Board by delivering the citation to the
City Police Department. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may, in its
sole discretion, elect to hear proceedings based upon a notice of violation
issued by a Code Enforcement Officer and upon written request of the
offender, in the interest of judicial expediency and consistent with due
process. In such limited circumstances, the notice of violation shall be
converted to a citation, based upon the hearing request of the offender.



   (B)   Except as provided in § 40.31 below, if a Code Enforcement
Officer believes, based on his or her personal observation or investigation,
that a person has violated a city ordinance he or she may issue a notice of
violation to the offender allowing the offender a specified period of time to
remedy the violation without fine. If the offender fails or refuses to remedy
the violation within the time specified, the Code Enforcement Officer is
authorized to issue a citation.



   (C)   The citation issued by the Code Enforcement Officer shall
contain the following information:

      (2)   The name and address of the offender to whom the
citation is issued;



      (3)   The date and time the offense was committed;



      (4)   The facts constituting the offense;



      (5)   The section of the code or the number of the ordinance
violated;



      (6)   The name of the Code Enforcement Officer;



      (7)   The civil fine that will be imposed for the violation if
the offender does not contest the citation;



      (8)   The maximum civil fine that may be imposed if the
offender elects to contest the citation;



      (9)   The procedure for the offender to follow in order to pay
the civil fine or to contest the citation; and



      (10)   A statement that if the offender fails to pay the civil
fine set forth in the citation or contest the citation, within the time
allowed, the offender shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing
before the Code Enforcement Board to contest the citation and that the
determination that the violation was committed shall be final, and that the
offender shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the final order
to District Court.



   (D)   After issuing a citation to an offender, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall notify the Code Enforcement Board by delivering the citation to
the City Clerk, or his/her designee. The Code Enforcement Officer, in the
exercise of his/her sole discretion, may also elect to provide notice of the
issuance of the citation to any lienholder with an interest in the subject
premises.



   (E)   The offender to whom the citation is issued shall respond to
the citation within seven days of the date of issuance by either paying the
civil fine or requesting, in writing, a hearing before the Code Enforcement
Board to contest the citation. If the offender fails to respond to the
citation within seven days the offender shall be deemed to have waived the
right to a hearing and the determination that a violation was committed shall
be considered final.



   (F)   If the offender does not contest the citation within the time
prescribed, the citation, as issued shall be deemed a final order determining
that the violation was committed and imposing the civil fine set forth in the
citation, and that the offender shall be deemed to have waived the right to
appeal the final order to the District Court. Notice of this final order
shall be served upon the offender in accordance with § 40.36.

Board who fails to appear at the time and place set for the hearing shall be
deemed to have waived the right to a hearing to contest the citation and the
determination that a violation was committed shall be final. In this event,
the citation, as issued, shall be deemed. A final order determining the
violation was committed and shall impose the civil fine set forth in the
citation, and the offender shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal
the final order to District Court. Notice of the final order shall be
provided to the offender in the manner prescribed in division (F) of this
section.



   (D)   All testimony shall be taken under oath and recorded.
Testimony shall be taken from the Code Enforcement Officer, the offender, and
any witnesses to the violation offered by the Code Enforcement Officer or
offender. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due
process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings.



   (E)   The Code Enforcement Board shall, based on the evidence,
determine whether a violation was committed. If it determines that no
violation was committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered.
If it determines that a violation was committed, the Board may issue an order
upholding the citation and may order the offender to do either or both of the
following: pay a civil fine in an amount up to the maximum authorized by the
ordinance or remedy a continuing violation within a specified time to avoid
the imposition of a fine, as authorized by ordinance.



   (F)   Every final order of the Code Enforcement Board following a
hearing shall be reduced to writing, which shall include the findings and
conclusions of the Board and the date the order was issued. A copy shall be
furnished to the person named in the citation. If the offender named in the
citation is not present when the final order is issued, the order shall be
delivered to that person by regular first-class mail, certified mail, return
receipt requested; by personal delivery; or by leaving the notice at the
person's usual place of residence with any individual residing therein who is
18 years of age or older and who is informed of the contents of the order.

§ 50.01  APPLICATION FOR SERVICE.



   Each prospective customer desiring gas or water-sewer service shall be
required to complete a Murray Municipal Utilities application for service
form before service will be supplied by the Utility.  Proper identification
is required.  A service contract may be required for certain commercial and
industrial customers whose service requirements vary from what the Utility
considers as being standard.



(Ord. 711, passed 7-24-80; Am. Ord. 93-998, passed 3-25-93)



§ 50.02  DEPOSIT.



   (A)   A deposit or suitable guarantee equal to twice the average
monthly bill will be required of all commercial and industrial customers
before service is initiated.  A minimum gas deposit for mobile homes, rental
dwellings, and apartments will be $100. A minimum water deposit for mobile
homes, rental dwellings, and apartments will by $100. There will be no
deposit required for homeowners for water or gas service.



   (B)   Deposits will earn interest at the rate of 3% per year (not
compounded).  Interest will be paid at the time the deposit is refunded or
at the time it is applied against a final bill.  The 3% interest will apply
to all deposits presently being held.



   (C)   Murray Municipal Utilities may, at its option, return deposits
to the customer after one year.  The Utility may require any commercial or
industrial customer to increase their deposit if inflation or increased use
of service has caused the deposit to be less than a two-months’ average
bill.

§ 50.03  CONNECT FEES AND SERVICE CHARGES.



   (A)   The customer will pay a $15 connect fee for each meter service
requested in his or her name (water or gas).  Customers will be exempt from
the $15 connect fee per meter when a read and transfer work order is
requested for new services.  A service charge of $50 will be assessed for
checks returned by bank for nonpayment.



   (B)   Natural Gas System technicians will inspect gas lines from the
meter into the dwelling and check the equipment inside the dwelling before
gas may be delivered to the customer.



   (C)   There will be a $10 fee per customer to light the pilot light
on any gas appliance and will be added to the first utility bill.

§ 50.04  BILLING.



   (A)   The Utility shall bill each customer on one monthly bill for
the rendition of all gas, water, and sewer charges due under city ordinance
for sanitary garbage collection.  The bill shall show each separate item
charged for, with same to be collected and enforced together.  All monthly
charges rendered for gas, water, and sewer services and sanitary garbage
collected shall be due 15 days after the date of the bill.  Failure to
receive a bill will in no way release the customer from due dates or other
mentioned obligations.



   (B)   Bills for metered service shall be determined by meter
registration unless the meter fails to register, in which case a bill will be
rendered based on previous average consumption of comparable months.



   (C)   Bills paid on or before the due date will be payable at the
net amount.  Payments made after the due date will be subject to a late
payment charge.  The late payment charge for all classes of customers will
be 5% of all monthly charges excluding arrears and taxes.  If the due date
falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a city government observed holiday, the next
business day following will become the due date.  If remittance is made by
mail, the postmark date will become the date of the payment.



   (D)   Bills are to be paid at the collection office of Murray
Municipal Utilities.

§ 50.05  DISCONTINUANCE OR REFUSAL OF SERVICE.



   (A)   Discontinuance of service for nonpayment of utility bill.  If
payment of the utility bill has not been received by Murray Municipal
Utilities on or before the due date of the bill, a second notice will be
mailed to the customer.  If payment has not been received on or before the
tenth day following the due date of the bill, the Utility will send its
cut-off man to the customer's premises, services will be discontinued
(unless, according to the cut-off man's judgment, discontinuance of service
would endanger life or property). Failure to pay any part of the utility bill
as rendered will subject all services to be discontinued unless arrangements
have been made with the utility Director.



   (B)   Refusal of service for nonpayment of former services. 
Service may be refused to any customer who has a delinquent account with the
Utility for any type past service.  If an application for service is
approved for a former customer who still owes for past service, the balance
due for the past service will become an arrears on the new account
established by the applicant.  If a customer has service at more than one
location and terminates service at one of the locations, any delinquent
balance resulting from the termination will become an arrears on the billing
for one of the other locations at which the customer is being served. 
Service may be refused if it is evident to the Utility that the applicant is
living arrears on the billing for one of the other locations at which the
customer is being served.  Service may be refused if it is evident to the
Utility that the applicant is living with a former customer who still owes
for former services rendered by the Utility.



   (C)   Discontinuance or refusal of service for reasons other than
nonpayment.



      (1)   The Murray Municipal Utilities may refuse to connect
service or may discontinue service for the violation of any of its rules and
regulations, schedule of rates and charges, or any contract between the
Utility and the customer.  For purposes of these ordinances, tampering with
a meter is considered theft of services within the meaning of the Kentucky
Penal Code.  The Utility may discontinue service to the customer for the
following reasons:



         (a)   The theft of gas or water or for the appearance of
theft devices on the premises:



         (b)   The supplying or selling of gas, water, or sewer
service to other persons or premises without a written permit; or



         (c)   For waste or failure to maintain service lines
beyond the meter owned by the customer.



      (2)   The discontinuance of service by the Utility for any
cause does not release the customer from his or her obligation to the Utility
for any services rendered.



   (D)      Customer’s right to due process.



      (1)      The Murray Municipal Utilities will provide a
hearing process to the customer for the purpose of avoiding the
discontinuance of service, restoring service which has been discontinued, or
for other service related claims which the customer feels he or she has
against the Utility.  Explanation of the process is a part of the rules and
regulations of the Utility and will be provided to the customer as explained
in § 50.14.  If the customer fails to receive or has lost his or her copy
of the rules and regulations, both the Utility and the second notice will
instruct him or her as to how to obtain information pertaining to his or her
right to due process.



      (2)      The course of due process will be that the
customer has the right to request a hearing with the Director of Finance or a
person designated to act in his or her absence to resolve questions
pertaining to the amount billed the customer by the utility or pertaining to
the customer’s rights to be served by the Utility.  The hearing will be
not later than 96 hours after request.  The customer can make the request by
calling the Director of Finance, by writing, or by coming by to the offices
of Murray Municipal Utilities.



      (3)      If the customer’s claim is not resolved by the
Director of Finance, the customer has the right to appeal his or her claim to
a three-person hearing committee appointed by the Director of Murray
Municipal Utilities.  Such appeal must be in writing and be delivered to the
Director or his or her deputy or agent within 24 hours of denial of the
customer’s claim.  The appeal hearing will be held not later than five
days after filing the appeal.  The committee will weigh evidence presented
by the customer and the Director of Finance.  The Director of Finance may
not be appointed to the hearing committee.



      (4)      If the customer’s claim is not resolved by the
hearing committee, he or she has the right to appeal to the Public Works
Committee and will be heard at the Committee’s next scheduled meeting. 
The appeal to the Public Works Committee must be in writing and filed with
the City Clerk within 72 hours of denial of the customer’s appeal to the
Director.  The appeal hearing will be held not later than five days after
filing the appeal with the City Clerk.  The decision of the Public Works
Committee will be final.



      (5)      The customer must make his or her initial request
at least two days prior to the due date of the bill and must be available for
the hearings at time set by the Utility

§ 50.06  RECONNECTION CHARGE.



   If service has been discontinued by the Murray Municipal Utilities for
nonpayment of a bill, a charge of $25 per utility service reconnected during
Utility business hours will be collected by the Utility before service is
restored.  Service may not be restored until the next business day. If
service is disconnected due to tampering with metering equipment or
intentional destruction of metering equipment, actual cost of repair and
reconnection will be collected before service is restored.  Also a $50
reconnect fee will be charged for gas customers requesting continuance of gas
service after having had service discontinued during non- heating months.

§ 50.07  LOSS OF WATER OR GAS ON CUSTOMER'S PREMISES.



   The customer will be responsible for maintaining all gas and water
facilities on his or her side of the meter.  He or she will also be
responsible for payment of all gas and water which is registered on the meter
serving his or her premises.  Billing for sewer service will be based on the
water meter readings.  If evidence shows that water was lost on the
customer’s side of the meter and that it did not go into the sewer lines,
the sewer charge will be adjusted to the normal monthly average of the
previous six months, for the period of the water leak not to exceed two
months.

§ 50.08  METER TESTS.



   The Murray Municipal Utilities will, at its own expense, make periodic
tests and inspections of its meters in order to maintain a high standard of
accuracy.  The Utility will make one additional test or inspection on
request of that meter at no charge to the customer.  Subsequent tests made
at the customer's request showing that the meter is accurate within 2%, slow
or fast, will result in no adjustment being made in the customer's bill and a
test charge of $10 will be paid by the customer.  In case the test shows
that the meter exceeds 2%, fast or slow, an adjustment will be made in the
customer's billing for only the billing period prior to the test date and the
cost of making the test shall be borne by the Utility.



(Ord. 711, passed 7-24-80)



§ 50.09  CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITY FOR UTILITY PROPERTY.



   All meters, service connections, and other equipment furnished by the
Murray Municipal Utilities shall be and remain the property of the Utility.

the property of the Utility on his or her premises, and in the event of loss
or damage to Murray Municipal Utilities’ property, arising from neglect of
the customer to care for same, the cost of necessary repairs or replacements
shall be paid by the customer.



(Ord. 711, passed 7-24-80)



§ 50.10  RIGHT OF ACCESS.



   Murray Municipal Utilities' identified employees shall have access to
the customer's premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of reading
meters, testing, repairing, removing, or exchanging any or all equipment
belonging to the Utility.



(Ord. 711, passed 7-24-80)



§ 50.11  TERMINATION OF CONTRACT.



   Customers who have fulfilled their contract terms and wish to
discontinue service must give at least three days written notice to that
effect, unless the contract specifies otherwise.  Notice to discontinue
service prior to the expiration of the contract term will not relieve the
customer from any minimum or guaranteed payment specified by the contract.



(Ord. 711, passed 7-24-80)



§ 50.12  INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE.

right to restrict the supply of gas or water in the event of scarcity or
whenever public welfare may so require.

shall discharge or cause to be discharged any industrial wastewater directly
or indirectly to sewerage facilities owned by the city without first
obtaining a city permit industrial wastewater discharge.



      (2)   The permit for industrial wastewater discharge may
require pretreatment of industrial wastewaters before discharge, restriction
of peak flow discharges, discharge of certain wastewaters only to specified
sewers of the city.



      (3)   Any agency and/or industries outside of the jurisdiction
of the city that wish to contribute wastewaters to the POTW must first sign
(through an authorized representative) an interjurisdictional agreement
whereby the agency and/or industrial user agree to be regulated by all
provisions of this chapter, state and federal regulations.



   (G)   Significant industrial users.  All significant industrial
users shall comply with National Categorical Pretreatment Standards and any
other applicable requirements promulgated by EPA or with any more stringent
pretreatment standards necessitated by local conditions.



   (H)   Approval on pretreatment of waste flows.



      (1)   If any waters or wastes are proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in division (E) above, the Mayor may condition his
approval on one or more of the following:



         (a)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition
for discharge to the public sewers,



         (b)   Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge, or



         (c)   Require payment to cover the added cost of
handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer
charges under provisions of division (M) herein.



      (2)   If the Mayor conditions his approval on the pretreatment
or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and
equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Mayor, and
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.



   (I)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand
interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Mayor, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in
excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful
ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the Mayor, and shall be located as to be readily and
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.



   (J)   Maintenance. Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalization
facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his
expense.



   (K)   Control manhole. When require by the Mayor, the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and
other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole when required, shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Mayor. The manhole shall
be installed the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him go as
to be safe and accessible at all times.



   (L)   Measurements, tests, and analysis. All measurements, tests,
and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference
is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR 261 EPA
Pretreatment Standards, and the current edition of "Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health
Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at the control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents on the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.  The
particular analysis involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of
all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken.  Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids
analysis are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH are
determined from periodic grab samples.



   (M)   Schedule of additional pretreatment.



      (1)   If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards or local limits, the
industrial user will be required to submit the shortest schedule by which the
user will provide such additional pretreatment. The completion date in this
schedule shall not be later than the compliance date, established for the
applicable pretreatment standard.



      (2)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the
form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to
the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for an
industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment months. No later than 14
days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance,
the user shall submit a progress report to the Mayor, including, as a
minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the
reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return to the
schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between
such progress reports to the Mayor.



   (N)   Suspension of permit.



      (1)   The Mayor may suspend a permit for industrial wastewater
discharge when such suspension is necessary in order to stop a discharge
which presents an imminent hazard to the public health, safety, or welfare,
to the local environment or to the city's sewerage system.



      (2)   Any discharger notified of a suspension of this permit
shall immediately cease and desist the discharge of such industrial
wastewater to the sewerage system. In the event of a failure of the
discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Mayor shall
take such steps as are reasonably necessary to insure compliance.



      (3)   Any suspended discharger may file with the Mayor a
request for a meeting with the Public Works Committee. The Committee shall
meet within 14 days of the receipt by the Mayor of such request. The
Committee shall hold a meeting on the suspension and either confirm or revoke
the action of the Mayor. Reasonable notice of the meeting shall be given to
the suspended discharger. At this meeting, the suspended discharger may
appear personally or through counsel, cross- examine witnesses and present
evidence in his own behalf.



      (4)   In the event that the Committee fails to meet within the
time set forth above or fails to make a determination within a reasonable
time after the close of the meeting, the order of suspension shall be stayed
until a determination is made either confirming or revoking the action of the
Mayor.



      (5)   The Mayor shall reinstate the permit on proof of
satisfactory compliance with all discharge requirements of the city.



   (O)   Revocation of permit.



      (1)   The Mayor may revoke a permit for industrial wastewater
discharge on a finding that the discharger has violated any provision this
chapter. No revocation shall be ordered until a meeting on the question has
been held by the Public Works Committee. At this meeting, the discharger may
appear personally or through counsel, cross-examine witnesses, and present
evidence in his own behalf. Notice of the meeting shall be given to the
discharger at least 15 days prior to the date of the meeting.



      (2)   Any discharger whose permit has been revoked shall
immediately stop all discharge of any liquid carried wastes covered by the
permit to any public sewer that is tributary to the sewerage system of the
city. The Mayor may disconnect or permanently block from such public sewer
the industrial connection sewer of any discharger whose permit has been
revoked if such action is necessary to insure compliance with the order of
revocation.



      (3)   Before any further discharge of industrial wastewater
may be made by the discharger, he must apply for a new permit for industrial
wastewater discharge, pay all charges that would be required upon initial
application together with all delinquent fees, charges, and penalties and
such other sums as the discharger may owe to the city. Cost incurred by the
city in revoking the permit and disconnecting the industrial connection sewer
shall be paid for by the discharger before issuance of a new permit for
industrial wastewater discharge.



      (4)   An Industrial User Discharge Permit shall not be
reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different
premises or a new or changed operation without, at a minimum, a 30-day prior
notification of the change to the Superintendent and provision of a copy of
the existing permit to the new owner.  The Superintendent may deny the
transfer of the permit if it is deemed necessary to comply with provisions of
this chapter.



   (P)   Pretreatment standards.



      (1)   All industrial users shall submit periodic reports
regarding the nature and concentration of all pollutants as outlined in their
wastewater charge permit. In addition, within 90 days following the date for
final compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case
of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater
into the POTW, and user subject to pretreatment standards of wastewater into
the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards or local requirements
shall submit to the Mayor a report indicating the nature and concentration of
all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated processes which are
limited by pretreatment standards or local requirements and the average and
maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are
limited by such pretreatment standards or local requirements. The report
shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or local
requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, iE not, what additional
O & M compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or local
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative
of the industrial user, and certified by a qualified professional.



      (2)   The Mayor may impose mass limitation on users which are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or local
requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitation are
appropriate. In such cases, all reports shall indicate the mass of pollutants
regulated by - pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These
reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge,
including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass
where requested by the Mayor, or pollutants contained therein which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. All analyses shall be
performed in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator
pursuant to Section 304 (g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and
amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the
Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
approved by the Administrator.



      (3)   The industrial user shall report new and/or increased
pollutants discharged to the sewers to the city.  The Superintendent shall
have the authority to deny or condition such changes if necessary.



         (a)   Baseline monitoring report (BMR).  A baseline
monitoring report must be submitted to the Superintendent by all industries
at least 90 days prior to the initiation of discharge.  The BMR shall
contain the following:



            1.   SIC code, production rate, process
description, list of raw materials, chemicals used in process, chemicals used
in cleanup, and finished products produced.



            2.   Name of facility contact person.



            3.   Total plant flow, types of discharges (batch,
continuous), average and maximum flows from each process.



            4.   Name and concentration of pollutants
discharged to the public sewer system that are regulated by this chapter,
state and/or federal pretreatment standards, sample type and location.



            5.   List of all pretreatment equipment.



         (c)   Self-monitoring reporting.  In accordance with 40
CFR 403.12(g), any industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the
case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW,
shall submit to the control authority during the months of June and December,
unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the
control authority or the approval authority, a report indicating the nature
and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
categorical pretreatment standards.  The report shall include measured or
estimated average daily flows for the reporting period.



      (4)   The industrial discharge permit shall contain effluent
limits, including Best Management Practices (BMP), based on applicable
pretreatment standards.



      (5)   The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has
demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant
is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present
only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the
pollutant due to activities of the industrial user.  [see CFR
403.12(e)(2)]  This authorization is subject to the following conditions:



         (a)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is
determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from
the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an
applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.



         (b)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the
duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge
permit, but in no case longer than five years.  The user must submit a new
request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit.



         (c)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not
present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of
the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the
facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.



         (d)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed
in accordance with § 52.01, Authorized Representative of Industrial User,
and include the certification statement as currently stated in Section IV,
ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, Heading E, SIGNATORY REQUIREMENTS,
Paragraph 3, CERTIFICATION, of the Wastewater Discharge Permit.



         (e)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as
a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method
from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that
pollutant was used in the analysis.



         (f)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Mayor
must be included as a condition in the user's permit.  The reasons
supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its
request for the waiver must be maintained by the pretreatment coordinator for
three years after expiration of the waiver.



         (g)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to
be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the
user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring
requirements of this division (P) of this section.



         (h)   This provision does not supersede certification
processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards,
except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standards.



   (Q)   Accidental discharge.



      (1)   All industrial users shall immediately notify the
Superintendent or the Wastewater Treatment Plant of an accidental
discharge/slug loading.



      (2)   The notification shall include location of discharge,
type of waste, concentrations and volume, and corrective actions.



      (3)   Within five days following an accidental discharge, the
user shall submit to the Mayor a detailed written report describing the cause
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be imposed by this
section or other applicable law.



      (4)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the
event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who
may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.



      (5)   Each user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this
chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and
expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall
be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing
users shall complete such a plan by January 1, 1984. No user who commences
contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall be
permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge
procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.



      (6)   As required by 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v), inspect and sample
the effluent from each significant industrial user at least one time per year.



      (7)   Slug discharge.  Evaluate at least once every two
years, whether each signinificant industrial user needs a plan to control
slug discharge.  If the POTW decides that a slug control plan is needed, the
plan shall contain at a minimum, the following elements.



         (a)   Description of discharge practices, including
nonroutine batch discharges.



         (b)   Description of stored chemicals.



         (c)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of
slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition
under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification
within five days.



         (d)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from
accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control
of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including
solvents) and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.



      (8)   Discharge of hazardous waste.  As required by 40 CFR
403.12(p), the industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director and State Hazardous waste authorities in writing
of any discharge into the POTW of any hazardous waste.  The report shall
contain the following:



         (a)   The hazardous waste number.



         (b)   Type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).

   The rates for each year subsequent to CY 2018 shall remain unchanged
until such time as amended by ordinance.



   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises
discharges sewage, water, or other liquid wastes, or uses water supplied on
other than a metered basis from either a private or a public water supply,
then the owner or occupant may be required to cause a water meter or other
measuring device to be installed which is acceptable to the City Council, the
Public Works Committee, or any other board of body of the City which may be
in charge and control of the municipal sewerage system.  The quantity of
water used, as measured by such meter, shall determine the sewage rate,
rental or charge. Pending installation of such meter, the sewage rate,
rental, or charge shall be at the prevailing rates based on a consumption of
6,000 gallons per month.  Said rate shall be determined by the rate
schedules above and applied based on the location of the real property being
located inside the city limits or outside the city limits.



   (D)   Each customer applying for a sanitary sewerage connection to
the Murray Water and Sewerage System shall pay the fee set by the following
sewer tap-on schedule:



      (1)   Sewer tap-ons, inside city, family residence - effective
07/01/2016.



         (a)   $1,500 for each single-family residence.



         (b)   $600 for each additional unit located within the
same structure.



      (2)   Sewer tap-ons, outside city effective 07/01/2016.



         (a)   $2,100 for each single-family residence.



         (b)   $840 for each additional unit located within the
same structure.



      (3)   In the event the cost to the city exceeds the above
tap-on fees, a determination of the actual cost shall be made by the Director
of Public Works and such cost shall be the responsibility of the water or
sewer customer.



      (4)   The above tap-on fees are in addition to the water and
sewer rates presently in effect or which may hereafter be adopted.



   (E)   Sewer rates provided in divisions (B) and (C) above are based
on the underlying assumption that all metered water consumption is eventually
returned to the sewage treatment system.  Where it can be evidenced that the
proportion of water actually returned to the treatment system by an
industrial customer is significantly different from the metered consumption,
service charges shall be determined on the basis of measured or estimated
wastewater discharge.  The city reserves the right to determine by whatever
means and methods it may find practicable, the amount of water consumption or
wastewater discharge that shall be used to compute sewer service charges.



   (F)   Surcharge for excessive strength. Users having a discharge
over the normal sewage strength of 300 mg/l suspended solids or 250 mg/l
B.O.D. shall incur an additional charge of $.14 per pound of suspended solids
and $.17 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand.



   (G)   The foregoing rates and charges for the use of and services
rendered by the Murray Water and Sewer System as established by divisions (A)
through (E) of this section shall become effective from and after March 7,
1991.

§ 52.10  METHOD OF BILLING.



   (A)   Sewer service charge shall be billed to each user on a monthly
basis and shall be computed in accordance with each user's water consumption
and strength or toxicity of discharge during the billed-for period.



   (B)   No reduction in sewer charges, fees, or taxes shall be
permitted in the event that certain wastes discharged to the sewage treatment
system contain pollutants in less concentrations than specified maximum
limitations.



   (C)   Each user shall be notified, at least annually, in conjunction
with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the total charge which
is attributable to operations and maintenance of the sewage system.



   (D)   Sewer charges to any customer who is initially rendered
services for less than one month shall be prorated on the basis of the
foregoing charges for the fractional part of the month for which services
were rendered.



(Ord. 798, passed 3-22-84)



§ 52.11  RATE REVIEW.



   (A)   A financial management system will be utilized that will
accurately account for revenues and expenditure of the sewer system
independent of any other utilities. The city shall review annually the sewage
contributions of users, the total cost of operation, maintenance and
replacement of the sewage works, and user charges.  User charges shall be
revised as necessary to accomplish the following.



      (1)   Maintain the proportionate distribution of operations,
maintenance and replacement cost among users of the treatment system.



      (2)   Generate sufficient revenues to offset costs associated
with the proper operation, maintenance, and replacement of the sewage system.



   (B)   Excessive strength and toxicity surcharges shall be reviewed
at the time of and in conjunction with the review of user charges. 
Surcharge rates shall be revised where necessary to reflect current treatment
and monitoring costs.

§ 52.98  ACTION FOR LEGAL OR EQUITABLE RELIEF.



   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes
into the city's wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this
chapter, federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the
city, the City Attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal or
equitable relief in the circuit court of this county.



(Ord. 793, passed 12-8-83)



§ 52.99  ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Administrative enforcement.



      (1)   Notification of violation (See Article V, Section 17). 
Whenever the city finds that an industrial or any other user has violated or
is violating this chapter, or hereunder the Mayor or his or her agent may
serve upon said user, written notice of the violation.  Within ten days from
the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan
for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted to the city.  Submission of this plan
in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before
or after receipt of the notice of violation.



      (2)   Consent orders.  The Mayor is hereby empowered to enter
into consent orders, assurance of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user or any other
users responsible for the noncompliance.  Such orders will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period also specific by the order.  Consent orders shall have the same force
and effect as administrative orders issued.



      (3)   Show cause hearing.



         (a)   The Mayor may order any industrial user which
causes or contributes to violation of this chapter or order or wastewater
permit issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action
should be taken.  Notice shall be served on the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action should be taken.  Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement
action and the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show
cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing.  Such
notice may be served on any principal executive, general partner or corporate
officer.  Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as noticed,
immediate enforcement action may be pursued.



         (b)   At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter,
testimony taken must be under oath and either audio recorded or
stenographically.  The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to
any party of the hearing, and any member of the public upon payment of the
usual charges thereof. 



      (4)   Compliance order.  When the city finds that an
industrial or other user has violated or continues to vio- late this chapter
or a permit or order issued hereunder, he or she may issue an order to the
user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time
period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and
are properly operated.  Orders may also contain such other requirements as
might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance,
including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-
monitoring, and management practices.



      (5)   Cease and desist orders.  When the city finds that an
industrial or any other user has violated or continues to violate this
chapter or those contained in any permit issued hereunder, the Mayor may
issue an order to cease and desist all such violations, and direct those
persons in noncompliance to:



         (a)   Comply forthwith.



         (b)   Comply in accordance with a compliance time
schedule set forth in the order.



         (c)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive
action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge.



      (6)   Administrative penalties.  Any user who is found to
have violated any provision of this chapter, or the orders and permits issued
hereunder, may be fined in an amount not less than $500 but not to exceed
$1,000 per violation.  Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or
continue may be deemed a separate and distinct violation.  Such assessments
may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the city
shall have such other collection remedies as it has to collect other service
charges.



      (7)   Emergency suspensions (See Article V, Section 14):



         (a)   The city may suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or wastewater permit whenever such suspension is necessary in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing any of
the following conditions:



            1.   An imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of persons, or the environment.



            2.   An interference or pass through.



            3.   A violation of any condition of the POTW's
NPDES permit.



         (b)   Any user notified of a suspension of the
wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit shall immediately stop
or eliminate its contribution.  A hearing will be held within 14 days of the
notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the
user's waste discharge permit terminated.  In the event of a failure of the
person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Mayor shall take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment
to any individuals.  The Mayor shall reinstate the wastewater permit and/or
the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge.



         (c)   Any user which is responsible, in whole or part,
for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the city prior to the date of the hearing
described.



      (8)   Termination of permit (See Article V, Section 15).  Any
user who violates the following conditions of this chapter or a wastewater
discharge permit or order, or any applicable or state or federal law, is
subject to permit termination:



         (a)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge.



         (b)   Failure to report significant changes in
operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics.



         (c)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's
premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling.



         (d)   Intentional violation of permit conditions.



   (B)   Judicial remedies.  If any person discharges sewage,
industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system
contrary to the provisions of this chapter or any order or permit issued
hereunder, the Mayor, through the City Attorney, may commence an action for
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Circuit Court for Calloway
County.



      (1)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or an order or permit
issued hereunder, the Mayor, through the City Attorney, may petition the
court for the issuance of the preliminary or permanent injunction, or both
(as may be appropriate) which restrain or compels the activities on the part
of the user.  In the event the Mayor chooses to correct the violation
himself, the cost of such correction may be added to the next scheduled sewer
service charge payable by the person causing the violation.  The city shall
have such remedies to collect these fees as it has to collect other sewer
service charges.



      (2)   Civil penalties.



         (a)   Any  user who has violated and/or continues to
violate this chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable
to the city for a civil penalty of not less than $500 but not more than
$5,000 plus actual damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as
long as the violation continues. In addition to the above described penalty
and damages, the city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs,
and other expenses his enforcement activities, including special sampling
monitoring expenses.



         (b)   The city shall petition the court to impose,
assess, and recover such sums.  In determining amount of liability, the
court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not
limited to, the economic benefit gained through the  user's violation,
corrective actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the
user, and any other factor as justice requires.



      (3)   Criminal violations.



         (a)   Any user who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this chapter, or any orders, or permits issued hereunder shall,
upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less
than $500 but not to exceed $5,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment
for not more than one year, or both.



         (b)   Any user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or
other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter,
or wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall,
upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than $500 but not more
than $5,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one
year, or both.



   (C)   Additional enforcement action.



      (1)   Annual publication of significant violations.  The city
shall publish, at least annually in the largest daily newspaper circulated in
the service area, a description of those industrial users who are found to be
in significant violation, as defined by this chapter, with any provisions of
this chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder during the period since
the previous publication.



      (2)   Performance bonds.  The city may decline to reissue a
permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions
of this chapter or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless such
user first files with it a satisfactory bond, payable to the POTW, in a sum
not to exceed a value determined by the Mayor to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.



(Ord. 89-913, passed 11-30-89; Am. Ord. 92-985, passed 8-13-92)



§ 52.100  SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS.



   (A)   New sources.



      (1)   Categorical standards are based on existing source
industries and new source industries.  The term "new source" shall mean any
building, structure, facility or installation from which there is or may be a
discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commence after the
publication of proposed pretreatment standards provided that:



         (a)   The building, structure or facility or
installation is constructed at a site which no other source is located; or



         (b)   It totally replaces the process or production
equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing source; or



         (c)   The production or wastewater generating processes
are substantially independent of an existing source at the same site.



      (2)   New sources shall install and have in operating
condition and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to
meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. 
Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must
meet all applicable pretreatment standards.



         (a)   All discharge limits calculated under 40 CFR 403.6
(c) (304) must be complied with by all industrial users subject to production
based standards.



         (b)   Each industrial user shall report to the
pretreatment coordinator production rates annually.



   (B)   Conversion of mass limits to concentration limits.  When the
limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of
mass of pollutant per unit of production, the city may convert the limits to
equivalent limitations expressed as effluent concentration limits.



   (C)   Dilution.  Except where expressly authorized, no industrial
user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way
attempt to dilute a discharge as a substitute for adequate treatment to
achieve compliance.



   (D)   Monitoring combined water streams.  Where a treated regulated
process wastestream is combined prior to treatment with wastestreams not
regulated, the industrial user may monitor either the segregated wastestream,
or the combined wastestreams using the combined wastestream formula.  The
industrial user may change monitoring points only with prior approval from
the city and not for purposes of dilution in order to achieve compliance.



   (E)   Violation notification.  If sampling performed by an
industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within
24 hours.  The user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. 
Exception to this regulation is only if the city performs sampling within the
same time period for the same pollutant in question.

         (e)   Total footage of each certified nonparticipating
property parcel fronting directly on the street main extension.



         (f)   Owner of each certified parcel.



      (2)   In addition to entering the information concerning
construction costs of lines bordered by nonparticipating parcels in a ledger,
the Director of the System shall cause to be recorded in the proper records
of the Calloway County Clerk the information contained in the certified
nonparticipating property parcel ledger, and the fact that the information is
maintained on file in the office of the Director of Murray Public Works and
Utilities.  The Director shall also request the County Court Clerk to enter
a notation on the property deed of each certified nonparticipating parcel
calling the attention of prospective purchases of the property to the
classification by the city of the property as a nonparticipating parcel.



      (3)   No property owned by an applicant for a street main
extension shall be eligible for certification as a nonparticipating parcel.



      (4)   In the case of street main extensions where some parcels
of property fronting on the extension have an unusual amount (large or small)
of frontage in relation to the potential service that might accrue to the
parcel from a future tap-on to the extension, the Council may elect to add to
the nonparticipating classification.  The addendums shall be certified by a
majority vote of the Council, and this information shall be entered in the
ledger in addition to the total footage of the parcel fronting directly on
the street main extension.



      (5)   The owner of all nonparticipating property shall be
notified of the pending classification by the Director of Murray Public Works
and Utilities prior to submission of street main extension construction plans
to the Council.  This notification shall include a statement encompassing
the ramifications of such a classification, particularly as set forth in
division (D) below.  The owner of the property shall again be notified after
Council action certifying their property as nonparticipating.  In such
nonparticipating parcel addition, the Director shall cause to be run in a
local newspaper a notice of designation.  The second notice required here
shall be sent by the Director prior to the beginning of street main extension
construction, and shall notify the owner of the action taken by the Council.



   (D)   Tap-ons furnishing service to any nonparticipating parcel of
property falling under the purview of division (C) above shall be allowed
only after the applicant for such service has paid to Murray Public Works and
Utilities the proper share of construction due for the line to be tapped on,
with interest at 7% per annum from date of certification of the property, in
addition to any fees and costs incurred under division (C)(2).



      (1)   The amount of construction cost due from an applicant
for service shall be computed by multiplying the total number of feet of
nonparticipating property to be served by one-half provided other property,
participating or nonparticipating, lies directly across the roadway, artery,
or easement on which the street main lies, and by the average per foot
construction cost of the line as entered in the nonparticipating parcel
construction ledger.  In cases where only the applicant for service can
feasibly be served by a particular section of street main, computation shall
be made by multiplying the total number of feet of nonparticipating property
by the factor of one, and then by the average per foot construction cost of
the street main.  In cases where an amount of construction compensation cost
has been certified by the Council and this cost entered in the
nonparticipating parcel ledger, this cost, plus interest, shall be assessed
in lieu of any aforementioned computed costs.  Interest, as well as fees and
costs incurred under division (C) (2), shall be construction cost assessment.



      (2)   In the event property originally classified as
nonparticipating has been subdivided, only the footage of the applicant's
parcel which fronts the line shall be considered in computing the amount due
from the applicant.  However, any applicant requesting service from a
nonparticipating parcel shall be required to pay the construction cost
accrued from the footage of any and all nonparticipating parcels owned by him
which front on the street main from which service is to be made.



   (E)   Tap-ons to utilities for the purpose of street main extension
shall not be classified as a service tap-on, and shall not fall under the
purview of division (D).



   (F)   Construction costs and interest collected under the purview of
division (D) shall be refunded to the depositor, but shall be subject to
divisions (H) and (I).



   (G)   When and as houses or buildings abutting on street mains that
fall under the purview of division (A) are completed, the house or building
occupied by a bona fide owner or responsible tenant who has entered into a
contract for use of Murray Public Works and Utilities' service, and the
parcel of property from which the service line originated has never fallen
under the purview of division (D), then Murray Public Works and Utilities
shall make refunds to the depositor, but subject to divisions (G) and (H), in
amounts calculated as follows, at the option of Murray Public Works and
Utilities, a refund of $100 will be made to the depositor and the refund so
computed shall be made only once for each  new customer connected.



   (H)   Under no circumstances shall the total amount of the refunds
(excluding interest accrued under divisions (D)(1), (D)(2), or (F) exceed the
total amount deposited with Murray Public Works and Utilities.



   (I)   No part of any funds collected after ten years is to be
returned to the depositor.

available pressure on the street main is, in the judgment of the Public Works
and Utilities sufficient to enable the giving of proper service at the fire
hydrant under normal and ordinary conditions.  The Public Works and
Utilities will render the aforesaid service at a cost to the municipality in
accord with the then prevailing rate schedule for public fire protection.

§ 72.11  NOTICE OF PARKING VIOLATION.



   (A)   Any vehicle parked in violation of this chapter shall be
issued a citation by any police officer or other person authorized by the
Chief of Police. A copy of the citation shall be issued by conspicuously
placing it on the windshield of an illegally parked vehicle in a secure
manner or in a prominent place thereon. Such posting of the citation shall be
deemed prima facie evidence that the violation occurred and that the owner of
the vehicle was properly notified of the violation. In the event that the
registered owner of the vehicle drives the vehicle away from or in any manner
leaves the site of the violation while the issuing officer is preparing the
citation, this in fact shall be noted on the citation and shall constitute
prima facie evidence that the citation was issued and that an attempt was
made to notify the owner of the vehicle of the violation in accordance with
this section.



   (B)   The citation shall contain the following information:



      (1)   The date and time the citation was issued;



      (2)   A statement of the specific parking violation for which
the citation was issued;



      (3)   A statement of the monetary penalty established, as
provided in § 72.99;



      (4)   The registration number and make of vehicle in violation
of this chapter;



      (5)   The name or an identifying number of the person issuing
the citation;



      (6)   A statement that the notice represents a determination
that a parking violation has been committed by the owner of the vehicle and
that the determination shall be final unless the person requests a hearing
before the Parking Enforcement Hearing Board within seven (7) days;



      (7)   The procedure for the person to follow in order to
respond to the citation or to contest the citation; and



      (8)   A statement that a parking violation may result in
impoundment of the vehicle for which the owner may be liable for a fine and
towing and storage charges or fees.



   (C)   If the owner of a vehicle cited for a parking violation has
not responded to the notice within seven (7) days, a second notice shall be
sent to the last known address of the registered owner by certified mail.
Such notice shall state that if the owner docs not respond to the notice by
cither paying the fine or by requesting in writing a hearing within seven (7)
days of receipt of the notice, the owner shall be deemed to have waived his
or her right to a hearing and the determination that a violation was
committed shall be considered final.

§ 72.12  CONTEST OF VIOLATION; HEARING; APPEAL.



   (A)   Any person cited for a parking violation may contest the
determination that a violation occurred by requesting, in writing, a hearing
before the Parking Enforcement Hearing Board. The request for a hearing shall
be addressed to the Parking Enforcement Hearing Board and delivered to the
Murray Police Department within the required seven (7) day time limit. When a
hearing has been requested, the Board shall schedule a hearing to be held no
later than fourteen (14) days from the date of receipt of the request, unless
prior to the hearing the person requesting such hearing requests an extension
of time not to exceed fourteen (14) days. Not less than seven (7) days before
the date of the hearing, the city shall notify the requester of the date,
time and place of the hearing. The notice may be given by certified mail,
return receipt requested, by personal delivery, or by leaving the notice at
the person's usual place of residence with any individual residing therein
who is eighteen (18) years of age or older and who is informed of the
contents of the notice. Any person requesting a hearing who fails to appear
at the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have waived the
right to a hearing to contest the citation and shall be deemed to have
refused to pay the fine levied by the citation. The Board shall enter a final
order determining the violation was committed and shall impose the
appropriate civil penalty. A copy of the order shall be served on the
violator.



   (B)   At the hearing, the Board may consider the parking citation,
and any other written report made under oath by the officer who issued the
citation in lieu of an officer's personal appearance at the hearing. After
consideration of the evidence, the Board shall determine whether a violation
was committed. Where it has not been established that the violation was
committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered. Where it has
been established that a violation was committed, the Board shall uphold the
citation and order the owner to pay the citation within seven (7) days. An
administrative hearing fee of fifty dollars ($50) will be added to the amount
of the original fine if the Board upholds the citation. A copy of such order
shall be furnished to the owner. If the fine amount plus the administrative
hearing fee is not received within seven (7) days of the hearing date, a late
fee of fifty dollars ($50) shall be added to the original fine amount.
Failure to pay the fine(s) within an additional seven (7) days may result in
a summons being issued in the name of the registered owner of the vehicle
requiring the owner to appear in Calloway County District Court.



   (C)   An appeal from the Parking Enforcement Hearing Board's
determination may be made to the Calloway County District Court within seven
(7) days of the Board's determination. The appeal shall be initiated by
filing a complaint and a copy of the Parking Enforcement Hearing Board's
order in the same manner as any civil action under the rules of civil
procedure. The action shall be tried de novo and the burden shall be upon the
city to establish that a violation occurred. If the court finds that a
violation occurred, the owner shall be ordered to pay to the city ALL FINES,
FEES AND PENALTIES OCCURRING AS OF THE DATE OF JUDGMENT.

§ 72.15  HEARING OF THE VALIDITY OF IMPOUNDMENT; APPEAL.



   (A)   The owner of a vehicle or other person entitled to possession

equal to the fines and fees accrued as of the date of the hearing request, or
seventy five dollars ($75) whichever is less.



   (D)   If the owner or person claiming right of possession of the
vehicle is unable to pay the amount of the bond, the hearing shall be held
within seventy-two (72) hours of the date of the request for hearing is
received, unless such person requests or agrees to a continuance.



   (E)   No less than five (5) days prior to the date set for the
hearing, the city shall notify the person requesting the hearing of the date,

the cart.  Each cart contains a serial number and if it is lost or stolen,
the resident must immediately report same to the Sanitation Department.

the City Clerk may require.



   (E)   Interest and penalty on unpaid tax.  The transient room tax
imposed by this section remaining unpaid after it becomes due shall bear

the unpaid tax for each month or fraction of a month the tax remains unpaid.

ordinance, may be used to finance the cost of acquisition, construction,
operation, and maintenance of facilities useful in the attraction and
promotion of tourist and convention business and shall include athletic
stadiums.  The balance of the money collected from the imposition of this
tax shall be used for the purposes set forth in KRS 91A.350.  Proceeds from

or restaurant.  Any money not expended by the Commission during any fiscal
year will be used to make up a part of the Commission's budget for its next
fiscal year.  The creation and establishment of the Recreational, Tourist,
and Convention Commission are approved, confirmed, and ratified.

shall:



      (1)   Within thirty (30) days after notification of such

place.



      (2)   Within the same thirty (30) days remove any different
number, which might be mistaken for or confused with the number assigned to
the structure by the issuing authority.



   (B)   Each principal building or structure shall display the number
assigned to the face of the building.  In case the principal building or
structure is occupied by more than one business or family dwelling unit, each
separate front entrance must display a separate number.

principal building, or each front entrance to such building, shall be posted
in a manner as to be legible and distinguishable from the street or road on
which the property is located, with numbers applied, of not less than three
inches (3") in height.

background) will be used to mark only those streets/roads that have been
legally named by the City Council.  Signs used to identify private drives
will not be allowed to look like official city signs.  This will prevent
confusion, which could keep emergency personnel from reaching other residents
in the shortest possible time.

assessed a fee which is based on the pro rata portion of the remainder of the
license period; however, the cost of any license shall not be less than one
half (½) the amount of the full fee for an annual license of that type.



(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12; Am. Ord. 2013-1618, passed 10-10-13; Am.
Ord. 2016-1718, passed 11-22-16)



§ 118.021  PAYMENT OF LICENSE FEES; DELINQUENCY.



   No licensee shall enter into or begin operating any business for which
a license is required by this chapter until the license fee has been paid in
full. The fee for renewal of any license shall be paid with the renewal
application. Failure to pay any license fee within ten (10) days after it
becomes due shall result in a penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the
license fee. Any licensee failing to pay the fees, including penalties,
within ten (10) days after such fees are due may be subject to revocation of
the license and to other penalties as provided in § 118.999.



(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)  Penalty, see § 118.999



§ 118.022  REFUND OF FEES.



   (A)   Should any licensee under this chapter be prohibited from
conducting the licensed business for the full period covered by the license
because of any changes that may hereafter be made in the laws of the
commonwealth with reference to alcoholic beverages or other cause outside
licensee’s control, then the city shall refund to licensee the
proportionate part of the license fee for the period during which licensee is
prevented from carrying on said business if the licensee provides sufficient
proof to the City ABC Administrator that such period of inactivity was not
the fault of the licensee or the result of a revocation, suspension or other
wrongdoing by licensee, or an agent or employee of the licensee.



   (B)   In the event a violation of this chapter occurs that results
in the suspension or revocation of the license, the city shall not be
required to refund any portion of the license fee.



(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)



§ 118.023  REGULATORY LICENSE FEE.



   (A)   Pursuant to KRS 243.075, there is hereby imposed a regulatory
license fee on the gross receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages of each
license issued by the City ABC Administrator. As of the time of adoption of
this chapter, the regulatory license fee shall be eight percent (8%) of gross
sales of all alcoholic beverages sold by the drink. In the case of retail
sales of package distilled spirits and wine, the regulatory license fee shall
be eight percent (8%) of gross sales. The regulatory license fee shall be
eight percent (8%) on gross retail sales of package malt beverages.
Thereafter, the City Council shall adopt at the budget adoption for each
subsequent fiscal year, such annual rate for the regulatory license fee as
shall be reasonably estimated to ensure full reimbursement to the city for
the cost of any additional policing, regulatory, or administrative expense
related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the city. Should the city fail
to address the regulatory license fee in any budget, then the regulatory
license fee shall remain at the level at which it was last fixed until such
time as the City Council shall adjust the fee.



   (B)   Payment of such regulatory fee shall be remitted to the city
and shall be held in a separate account maintained for the purpose of fully
reimbursing the city for the estimated cost of any additional policing,
regulatory or administrative expense related to the sale of alcoholic
beverages in the city. The regulatory license fee shall be in addition to any
other taxes, fees or licenses permitted by law, except that a credit against
a regulatory license fee in the city shall be allowed in an amount equal to
any license fee imposed by the city pursuant to KRS 243.070. Payment of the
regulatory license fee shall accompany the tax return approved for such use
by the City Council. The return and payment are due no later than by the end
of the month immediately following each calendar quarter.



   (C)   Failure to pay such quarterly remittance within ten (10) days
of the due date constitutes a violation and subjects licensee to suspension
or revocation.



   (D)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay quarterly
remittance by the due date is five percent (5%) of the tax for each ninety
(90) days or fraction thereof. The total late filing penalty shall not exceed
twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax; provided, however, that in no case
shall the penalty be less than ten dollars ($10.00).



   (E)   Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum will
apply to any late payments.



(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)



§ 118.024  DISPOSITION OF FEES.



   The city shall transmit any fees received upon collection into the
appropriate designated account.

   (C)   The City ABC Administrator may from to time appoint such
additional personnel as is necessary to assist him or her in the
administration of this chapter.



   (D)   The salary for the office of City ABC Administrator, if any,
together with the salaries of any other personnel assisting the City ABC
Administrator, shall be fixed from time to time by the City Council.



   (E)   The functions of the City ABC Administrator shall be the same
with respect to the city licenses and regulations as the functions of the
Alcoholic Beverage Control Board of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (hereinafter
referred to as ABC Board) with respect to state licenses and regulations,
except that no amendment to these regulations proposed by the City ABC
Administrator may be less stringent than the statutes relating to Alcoholic
Beverage Control, or than regulations of the ABC Board. No regulation of the
City ABC Administrator shall become effective until the City Council has
first appropriately approved it.



   (F)   No person shall be a City ABC Administrator, an investigator
or an employee of the city under the supervision of the City ABC
Administrator, who would be disqualified to be a member of the ABC Board
under KRS 241.100.



   (G)   The City ABC Administrator shall have all authority as
authorized under KRS 241 through 244. The City ABC Administrator, and the ABC
Administrator’s investigators and Murray City police officers may inspect
any premises where alcoholic beverages are manufactured, sold, stored or
otherwise trafficked in, without first obtaining a search warrant.



   (H)   Should the City ABC Administrator at any time have reasonable
grounds to believe that any applicant, licensee, employee of a licensee, or
any stockholder, agent or employee of a licensed corporation, LLC or other
business organization, has a criminal record, he or she shall have the
authority to require such person to appear in person at the Murray Police
Department for the purpose of having his or her fingerprints taken.



   (I)   The City ABC Administrator before entering upon his or her
duties as such, shall take the oath as prescribed in Section 228 of the
Constitution and shall execute a bond with a good corporate surety in the
penal sum of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The ABC
Administrator may require any employee under the ABC Administrator’s
supervision to execute a similar bond in such penal sum as the Administrator
deems necessary.



   (J)   Appeals from the orders of the City ABC Administrator may be
taken to the state ABC Board by filing with the Board within thirty (30) days
a certified copy of the orders of the City ABC Administrator. The Board shall
hear matters at issue as upon an original proceeding. Appeals from orders of
the City ABC Administrator shall be governed by KRS Chapter 13B.



   (K)   When any decision of the City ABC Administrator shall have
been appealed, or when a protest has been lodged against an application for
any license within the City, and the ABC Board shall have made a decision
regarding such appeal or protested application, the City ABC Administrator,
upon receipt of notice of finality of the decision, shall enter such orders
and take such action as required by the final order of the ABC Board. As
provided by law, and as used herein, no order of the ABC Board is final until
all appeals or appeal times shall have been exhausted. A “final order” of
the ABC Board is the order entered by said Board, unless an appeal is taken
from the Board’s order, in which case the “final order” is the order
entered by the Board upon direction from the reviewing court of last resort
in the final order of said reviewing court.

§ 118.051  APPLICATION FEE .



   A nonrefundable application fee of $50.00 shall be paid with the filing

(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)



§ 118.052  FORM OF APPLICATION.

impede the objectives of those guidelines, the Council may, by municipal
order, adopt a questionnaire to be submitted to applicants for licenses. Upon
adoption of the questionnaire, it shall become a part of the application
process. The initial questionnaire adopted by the City Council is a part of
this chapter  and is incorporated in the ordinance codified herein as
Exhibit 4.4.3 A. The questionnaire may be altered, expanded, supplemented or
replaced by municipal order of the Council hereafter. In addition to the
information contained in the application and any city ordered questionnaire,
the City ABC Administrator may require such other information as the
Administrator may in his/her discretion deem desirable, reasonable or
appropriate to the consideration of the application.



(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)



§ 118.053  OTHER CONDITIONS.



   In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations
required or permitted by law:



   (A) The City ABC Administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage
license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his place
of business shall have been approved by the City Building Inspector, the City
Fire Marshall, the City Planning Department and any and all other inspections
required by the Kentucky Building Code;



   (B)   All applicants shall voluntarily submit to a criminal
background check and shall sign a waiver allowing the release of this
information to the City ABC Administrator; and



   (C)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be
granted or renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any
taxes or fees due the city at the time of issuing the license, nor shall any
license be granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or property, owned
and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any delinquent taxes or
fees due the city. Further, if a licensee becomes delinquent in the payment
of any taxes or any fees due the city at any rime during the license period,
the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be subject to
revocation or suspension.



   (D)   No person, whether an applicant for license, or a licensee,
shall in any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or
intimidate the City ABC Administrator, or any member of his or her staff, or
any state ABC administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application
or proposed application for license, or procedure for revocation or
suspension is pending before such officer. This division is not intended to
stifle expressions of opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the
ABC Administrators are public officials charged with the administration and
enforcement of the law, both local and state. Any person applying for a
license, or contesting the revocation or suspension of a license, who engages
in attempted bribes, threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a
city or state ABC Administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving
or retaining a license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law.
The procedures for appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or
suspensions under this section. This section shall not be interpreted to
prohibit monetary settlements in lieu of revocation or suspension of license
after a final order or revocation or suspension, where the ordinance and
applicable statutes allow for such payments in settlement.



(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)



§ 118.054  FORM OF LICENSE.



   All city licenses shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the
City Council and shall contain:



   (A)   The name and address of the licensee;



   (B)   The number of the license;



   (C)   The type of license;



   (D)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the
licensed premises;



   (E)   The name and address of the owner of the building in which the
licensed premises are located;



   (F)   The expiration date of the license;



   (G)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a
property or vested right and that it may be revoked at any time pursuant to
law.

§ 118.055  CHANGE OF INFORMATION.



   (A)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has
been issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change
shall be filed with the City ABC Administrator within ten (10) days of the
change.



   (B)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name
of corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that
ownership changes in such organizations be reported to the City ABC
Administrator. The City ABC Administrator can, therefore, investigate the
person to whom the ownership or management is transferred in order to
ascertain whether that person is precluded by statute from holding an
interest in an alcoholic beverage license.



      (1)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC
or other business organization herein, the word “change” is construed to
include any change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or
officers of the corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any

   (A)   Every year, except in the case of temporary licenses, each
licensee shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with
the City ABC Administrator no less than thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the license for the preceding license period or the same shall
be canceled, except where the licensee is unable to continue in business at
the same premises licensed during the preceding license period as a result of
construction, act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency or private organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether
such acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through
failure of landlord to renew exiting lease; provided that said licensee shall
file a written verified statement no less than twenty (20) days from the
expiration date of the license, setting forth these facts, and the City ABC
Administrator is hereby authorized to extend the time for filing of a renewal
of such license for a reasonable length of time within the sound discretion
of the City ABC Administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall pay a
license fee from the expiration date of the former license or licenses. Said
license fee shall not be payable until application is made for the transfer
of said license to a new location.



   (B)   The renewal by the City ABC Administrator of the license shall
not be construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred
prior to such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against
the licensee.



(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)



§ 118.057  LOST OR DESTROYED LICENSE.

discretion deems sufficient.

§ 118.059  PROCEEDINGS FOR REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE; NOTICE AND
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTEST; APPEAL; EFFECT OF REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.



   (A)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the
initiative of any law enforcement officer or of the City ABC Administrator,
the City ABC Administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any
license granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended
only after the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or
registered mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons
for such proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard
in opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of
proposed action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the
hearing. Notice shall be sufficient If mailed to the licensee at the address
shown in the last application for a license or in the last statement
supplemental to or in amendment of the application, whether or not the
mailing is receipted for or claimed.



   (B)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions
for revocation or suspension shall be prescribed by the City Council of the
City of Murray by municipal order. Such order shall be maintained on file in
the office of the City ABC Administrator and a copy furnished with any notice
of proposed revocation or suspension sent to a licensee. If the City Council
shall fail to adopt such municipal order, the procedures shall be those set
out in the Kentucky Administrative Procedure Act (KRS Chapter 13B).

   (D)   Within three (3) days after any order of revocation or
suspension of a license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to
the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to
the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown
in the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental
to the application shall be deemed sufficient compliance with this section.
The licensee shall at once surrender his license to the City ABC
Administrator. If the revoked or suspended license is not forthwith
surrendered by the licensee, the Chief of Police at the request of the City
ABC Administrator shall immediately cause one of his officers to take
physical possession of the license and return it to the City ABC
Administrator.



   (E)   When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former
licensee may, with prior approval of the City ABC Administrator, dispose of
and transfer his stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity.



   (F)   Appeal from the decision of the City ABC Administrator
revoking or suspending a license shall be to the ABC Board. The timely filing
of an appeal shall stay further proceedings for revocation.



   (G)   If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the City
ABC Administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall at
once suspend all operations authorized under his or her license. Upon the
entry of a final order of the ABC Board sustaining or ordering revocation or
suspension on appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations
authorized under this license.

§ 118.061  REFUSAL OF LICENSE; GUIDELINES FOR APPROVAL OF QUOTA LICENSES.



   (A)   The City ABC Administrator may refuse to issue or renew a
license for any of the following reasons:



      (1)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for
suspension or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for
state licenses according to KRS 243.450,243.490 and 243.500, as well as
violation of any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales
or the administration thereof;



      (2)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation
of license would be authorized; or



      (3)   If the applicant has made any false material statement
in his or her application.



   (B)   In the case of quota licenses, before approving an
application, the City ABC Administrator is hereby directed to consider, in
addition to the factors set out in KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, and any
other factors the Administrator determines in his or her discretion to be
reasonable and pertinent to the license application, the following criteria:



      (1)   Ownership: The City of Murray places great value on
business owners who are invested in the Murray community.



      (2)   Economic impact: The City of Murray desires businesses
which make the most positive impact on the community, in number of jobs,
payroll, property investment and revenues to the city.



      (3)   Site of business: The City of Murray is interested in
serving all geographic areas of the city. Therefore, the city does not wish
to cluster all licensed ABC outlets in one area.

protecting the character and beauty of our community.



      (5)   Revitalization of downtown: The City of Murray

Administrator may appeal the refusal to the ABC Board pursuant to KR 241.200.



(Ord. 2012-1585, passed 9-13-12)



§ 118.062  REVIEW OF LICENSE; BOOKS, RECORDS AND REPORTS.



   (A)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this
chapter shall provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the
conditions of any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing
requirement that a minimum percentage of the applicant’s business income is
earned from the sale of food. This documentation shall be provided on a
schedule to be coordinated with the applicant’s quarterly regulatory fee
filings. The city shall provide the form schedule to the licensee. The
licensee’s acceptance of a license to manufacture or traffic in alcoholic
beverages shall constitute consent to the filing of the quarterly report. In
the case of caterer filing, the quarterly report shall identify each catered
event by type of event, date and address of the event, and shall provide a
per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of food sales to alcohol sales
during the reporting period. This requirement for filing of reports
notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the premises of any
licensee and examine the books, audio and visual recordings and records to
determine whether the licensee is in compliance with all parts of this
chapter. Licensee shall be required to maintain all available video/audio
recordings for a minimum of 30 days. In the event the conditions of any
license requirement are not met during any particular quarter, the City ABC
Administrator shall have discretion in determining whether revocation is
appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of
time to reach compliance, If a good faith effort is demonstrated by the
licensee, the City ABC Administrator may apply an accounting period of at
least one (1) year in determining whether or not the food sale percentage
requirement has been met.



   (B)   (1)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and
maintain upon the licensed premises adequate books and records, including
audio and video recordings, of all transactions involved in the sale of
alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and regulations
of the ABC Board. Licensee shall be required to maintain all video/audio
recordings for a minimum of 30 days. Such books and records shall be
available at all reasonable times for inspection by the City ABC
Administrator and such city employees who may assist the City ABC
Administrator in his or her review.



      (2)   For the purpose of assisting the City ABC Administrator
in enforcement of this chapter, every licensee required to report to the ABC
Board under KRS 243.850 shall provide a copy of such report to the City ABC
Administrator. Copies of any and all reports and correspondences to the ABC
Board required by statute shall be furnished to the City ABC Administrator.

§ 118.063  DORMANCY.



   (A)   It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after ninety (90) days. Such is the intent of this
section. Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his
business interrupted by situations not under his control, various exceptions
to the dormancy rule have been included in this section.



   (B)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a
period of 90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set
forth in division (C) below are proved to the satisfaction of the City ABC
Administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the City ABC
Administrator. If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be
revoked by the City ABC Administrator.



   (C)   The provisions of division (B) of this section shall not apply
to any licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for
which a license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty,
death, the acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other
governmental agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is
voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to
renew existing lease. Prior to the expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such
licensee shall furnish to the City ABC Administrator a verified statement
setting forth the fact that the licensee is unable to continue in business,
for any of the specific reasons set forth herein, and the City ABC
Administrator may grant an extension of the dormancy with the license
continuing to remain in effect during the license period or until same is
transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no business is
transacted during said period; provided, however, no such license shall be
considered valid unless business is conducted there within 12 months from the
date of notice to the City ABC Administrator. Such extension may not extend
beyond the renewal date but may be for such times as the City ABC
Administrator deems appropriate in exercise of his or her sound discretion.

chapter and the provisions of the state ABC code, may, upon application to
the local ABC administrator, ask permission to expand the operation onto a
part, and only that part, of the public sidewalk which immediately adjoins
the licensed premises (hereinafter referred to as “sidewalk café”).

   The issuance of a permit shall be subject to the following conditions
and restrictions; provided, however, that the ABC Administrator may without
adverse hearing procedures impose additional reasonable restrictions or
withdraw approval upon the operation of any sidewalk cafe where necessary in
the judgment of the said Administrator to protect the public health, safety
or welfare or to prevent a nuisance from developing or continuing:



   (A)   No sidewalk cafe shall be permitted in any portion of the
public sidewalk where normal pedestrian traffic flow is obstructed. A minimum
clearance width of thirty-six (36) inches must be maintained on the public
sidewalk at all times. The sidewalk cafe shall not be permitted in any manner
to obstruct the entrance/exit to the restaurant.



   (B)   No tables, chairs or any other furnishings, except plant tubs,

tables, chairs, and other portable appurtenances shall be confined to the
area shown on the approved Permit. While such cafe is in operation, all
tables and chairs shall be kept in a clean, sanitary condition.



   (C)   The use of a portion of the public sidewalk as a sidewalk cafe
shall not be an exclusive use. All public improvements, including but not
limited to, trees, light poles, traffic signals, pull boxes or manholes, or
any public-initiated maintenance procedures, shall take precedence over said
use of the public sidewalk at all times.



   (D)   The licensee shall, in addition to all other requirements of
law, take reasonable steps to insure that alcoholic beverages are consumed
only by patrons of the establishment who are of age, and not by passersby or
persons who are not of age or who are obviously or apparently intoxicated.



   (E)   No disposable cups or drinking vessels may be used and the
licensee shall not permit any alcoholic beverages to be taken off premises by
patrons, customers or guests.



   (F)   No amplified sound shall be used within a sidewalk cafe. At no
time shall any music originating from any part of the Premises create a
nuisance.



   (G)   Dancing shall not be permitted or allowed in the sidewalk cafe.



   (H)   The licensee must at all times comply with all federal, state
and local laws regarding the sale, service and consumption of alcohol and the
operation of the premises.



   (I)   The permit for sidewalk cafe may not be assigned or
transferred.

filed with the ABC Administrator evidence of insurance insuring the licensee
against liability imposed, by law arising out of the ownership, maintenance
or operation of such sidewalk cafe in an amount to be established by the City
ABC Administrator. The city shall be named an additional insured in the
policy, providing such insurance and such policy shall further provide that
it may not be canceled except upon ten (10) day’s written notice (or more)
filed with the ABC Administrator.



§ 118.999  PENALTY.



   (A)   In addition to any criminal prosecution instituted in Calloway
District Court against an alleged violator, the City ABC Administrator may
assess the fines and penalties authorized in KRS 243.480, including the per
diem assessments for ongoing violations. Should the fines or penalties
assessed by the state change under KRS 243.480, then the fines or penalties
under this chapter shall be adjusted accordingly to mirror the fines or
penalties imposed by state law. Payment of all fines shall be made to the
city to be deposited in the appropriate designated account.



   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any of the
provisions of this Ordinance, for which no other penalty is hereby provided,
shall, for the first offense, be fined not less than one hundred dollars
($100.00) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) or imprisoned in the
county jail for not more than six (6) months, or both, and for the second and
each subsequent violation, he shall be fined not less than two hundred
dollars ($200.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned
in the county jail for not more than six months, or both. The penalties
provided for in this subsection shall be in addition to the revocation or
suspension of the offender’s license. If the offender is a corporation,
LLC, joint stock company, association or other business organization, or a
fiduciary, the principal officer or officers responsible for the violation
may be imprisoned.

and conditions of this chapter, the resolution granting the franchise and
such other contracts and documents entered into by franchisee relative to the
franchise.



   (D)   Franchisee, by acceptance of any franchise granted hereunder,
acknowledges and agrees that the matters contained in franchisee's
application for the franchise or supplements thereto, shall be incorporated
into the resolution granting the franchise as though set out verbatim and
shall thereafter be considered an integral part of such ordinance in all
communications, correspondence, filings, or applications with all appropriate
regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the FCC or the Public
Service Commission.

(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.31 CABLE SERVICE AND OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS (OVS); SEPARATE FRANCHISE
REQUIRED.



   A communications franchise shall not permit a franchisee to provide
cable services as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522(5)) within
the city. Upon a franchisee's request for a franchise to provide cable
services as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522(5)) within the
city, the city shall timely negotiate such cable franchise in good faith with
the franchisee. A communications franchise shall also not permit a franchisee
to operate an open video system. A person may operate an open video system
only if that person obtains a separate franchise permitting same, and such
person remits the maximum fees permitted by 47 U.S.C. § 573(c)(2)(b) and
where such person otherwise complies with FCC regulations promulgated
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 573. Absent such applicable separate franchise from
the city, a franchisee shall be prohibited from offering OVS service and any
such service shall be considered a breach of its franchise.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.32 USE OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY; POLICE POWERS; FRANCHISEE’S USE SUBORDINATE.



   A franchisee shall construct and maintain its facilities in accordance
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, including all permit
requirements, and fee payments, and all other city codes and ordinances in
effect as of the date of the award of its franchise or thereafter adopted to
the extent not in contravention of state or federal law. The grant of a
franchise does not in any way affect the continuing authority of the city
through the proper exercise of its home rule or statutory powers to adopt and
enforce ordinances necessary to provide for the health, safety and welfare of
the public. The city makes no express or implied representation or warranty
regarding its rights to authorize the installation or construction of
facilities on any particular segment of the rights-of-way. The burden and
responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of construction
or installation shall be entirely upon the franchisee. The use of the
rights-of-way authorized by any franchise shall in all matters be subordinate
to the city's use and rights therein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing:



   (A)   All rights and privileges granted herein are subject to the
police powers of the city and its rights under applicable laws and
regulations to regulate the construction, operation, and maintenance of
franchisee's system, including, but not limited to, the right to adopt and
enforce additional ordinances and regulations as the city shall find
necessary in the exercise of its police powers, the right to adopt and
enforce applicable zoning, building, permitting and safety ordinances and
regulations, the right to adopt and enforce regulations relating to equal
employment opportunities and the right to adopt and enforce ordinances and
regulations containing rights-of-way, communications, and utility standards.



   (B)   The city reserves the right to exercise its police powers,
notwithstanding anything in this chapter and in any franchise to the
contrary. Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter or a franchise
and any other present or future lawful exercise of the city's police powers
shall be resolved in favor of the latter.



   (C)   Franchisee shall not be excused from complying with any of the
requirements of this chapter or any subsequently adopted amendments to this
chapter, by any failure of the city on any one or more occasions to seek, or
insist upon, compliance with such requirements or provisions.



   (D)   If federal or state law alter the required services, fees,
costs, conditions or standards upon which the communications system is to
operate, the city shall have the right to amend this chapter to make it
consistent with the modified federal or state laws.



   (E)   Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be
subject to any present and future legislation or resolution, which may be
enacted by the city.

§ 119.33 EMERGENCIES.



   (A)   Franchisee shall assign a management level person to
coordinate with, and assist the city's emergency management agency, in the
development of emergency plans.



   (B)   If at any time, in case of fire or disaster in the city, it
shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of the city, to cut or move
any facilities, such cutting or moving may be done and any repairs rendered
necessary thereby shall be made by franchisee, at its sole expense.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.34 COMMUNICATIONS FRANCHISE FEES; TIMING OF PAYMENT.



   (A)   For the first year of the franchise, franchisee shall pay to
the city as compensation for the use of the rights-of-way, a communications
franchise fee equal to four percent (4%) of gross revenues calculated on the
past calender year. Thereafter, the franchise fee shall pay annually a
communications franchise fee equal to four percent (4%) of gross revenues.



   (B)   Timing of payment of communications franchise fees. The first
communications franchise fees shall be due and payable with the franchise
application. If the city does not grant the franchise, said payment shall be
returned by the city within ten days of final action by the city. Thereafter,
the payments shall be due annually on the anniversary of the granting of the
franchise.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.35 INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENTS AND UNDER PAYMENTS.



    If any communications franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not
received by the city on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue
from the due date until received, at the rate of one and one-half percent
(1.5%) per month, unless such other maximum rate is established by applicable
law.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.36 FEE STATEMENT.



   Each communications franchise fee payment shall be accompanied by a
statement (a "fee statement") showing the manner in which the communications
franchise fee was calculated. If any fee statement is determined to
understate the communications franchise fee owed, then the franchisee shall
provide the city with a corrected statement and shall pay such additional
amount owed together with interest on such amount, calculated pursuant to §
119.35 of this chapter.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.37 NO ACCORD AND SATISFACTION.



   No acceptance by the city of any communications franchise fee or any
other payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact
the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any communications franchise fee
or any other payment be construed as a release of any claim of the city.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.38 FRANCHISEE TO MAINTAIN RECORDS.



   A franchisee shall at all times maintain complete and accurate books of
account and records of the business, ownership, and operations of the
franchisee with respect to the system in a manner that allows the city to
determine whether the franchisee has properly calculated its communications
franchise fee in compliance with this chapter. Should the city reasonably
determine that the records are not being maintained in such manner, the
franchisee shall correct the manner in which the books and/or records are
maintained so that the franchisee comes into compliance with this section.
All financial books and records which are maintained in accordance with FCC
regulations, the regulations of the Kentucky Public Service Commission and
any other governmental entity that regulates utilities in Kentucky, and
generally accepted accounting principles shall be deemed to be acceptable
under this section. Such books and records shall be maintained for a period
of at least three years. The failure to provide information or maintain
records as required herein shall be grounds for forfeiture or revocation of a
franchise.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.39 RIGHT OF INSPECTION AND AUDIT.



   The city or its designated representatives shall have the right to
inspect, examine or audit, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, all documents, records or other information that pertain to the
system and/or a franchisee's communications franchise fee obligations under
its franchise. In addition to access to the records of the franchisee for
audits, upon request, a franchisee shall provide reasonable access to records
necessary to verify compliance with the terms of the franchise. A franchisee
shall pay all reasonable audit costs incurred by the city to a maximum of one
audit per year.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.40 COMMUNICATIONS FRANCHISE FEE NOT A TAX.



   The communications franchise fee is compensation for use of the
rights-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind. The
communications franchise fees required herein shall be in addition to, not in
lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions
otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the city. A franchisee
shall be fully responsible for the payment of all applicable taxes.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.41 ASSIGNMENT OF FRANCHISE.



   (A)   A franchise does not run with the land. A franchisee shall not
sell, assign, sublet, dispose of or otherwise transfer a franchise (or any of
the rights or privileges granted by such franchise) to another person,
including, without limitation, by operation of law, without the prior written
consent of the city; provided that such transfer may occur without the
consent of the city to an affiliate upon 30 days prior notice to the city.



   (B)   In seeking the city's consent to a transfer, the franchisee
and its proposed transferee shall provide to the city in writing:



      (1)   Such information with respect to the proposed transferee
as is currently required of applicants for a renewal of a franchise; and



      (2)   An agreement, in form and substance acceptable to the
city, that the transferee will assume and be bound by all of the provisions,
terms, and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and shall be
primarily liable and obligated under such documents without, however,
relieving the transferring franchisee from its obligations to the city under
such documents, including without limitation its obligations under §
116.02(V) of this chapter.



      (3)   Franchisee shall be liable to the city for any and all
costs incurred by the city, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' and other Consultants' fees, resulting from any such attempt to
transfer the franchise.



      (4)   Nothing in any approval by the city of any transfer
pursuant to this section shall be construed to waive, release or delegate any
rights or powers of the city.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.42 FORFEITURE OF FRANCHISE AND PRIVILEGE.



   In case of failure on the part of a franchisee, its successors and
assigns, to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or its
franchise, or if the franchisee, its successors and assigns, should do or
cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of this
chapter or the terms of its franchise, the franchisee, its successors and
assigns, shall forfeit all rights and privileges permitted by this chapter
and its franchise, and all rights hereunder shall cease, terminate and become
null and void, provided that said forfeiture shall not take effect until the
city shall carry out the following proceedings: Before the city declares the
forfeiture or revocation of a franchise, it shall first serve a written
notice upon the franchisee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure
complained of, and the company shall have 30 days thereafter, or such other
reasonable period established by the City Council, in which to cure the
default by complying with the conditions of its franchise and fully remedying
any default or violation. If at the end of such 30 day or other reasonable
period, the city determines that the conditions have not been complied with,
the city shall take action by an affirmative vote of a majority of the City
Council present at the meeting and voting, to terminate the franchise,
setting out the grounds upon which the franchise is to be forfeited or
revoked. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from invoking any other remedy
available at law or in equity.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



RIGHTS-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT AND FACILITIES REQUIREMENTS



§ 119.55 REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.



   Upon expiration of a franchise, whether by lapse of time, by agreement
between the franchisee and the city, or by forfeiture thereof, the franchisee
shall remove, at its sole cost, from the rights-of-way any and all of its
facilities that are the subject of such franchise within a reasonable time
after such expiration, not to exceed 90 days, and, it shall be the duty of
the franchisee immediately upon such removal to restore the rights-of-way
from which the facilities are removed to as good condition as the same were
before the removal was effected and as required by the city. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the city may allow facilities to be left in place when the
city determines in its sole discretion that it is not practical or desirable
to require removal.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.56 RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.



   Whenever the city shall in its exercise of the public interest request
of the franchisee the relocation or reinstallation of any of its facilities,
the franchisee shall forthwith remove, relocate, or reinstall any such
property as may be reasonably necessary to meet the request and the cost of
such relocation, removal, or reinstallation of the facilities shall be the
exclusive obligation of such franchisee. A franchisee shall, upon request of
any other person requesting relocation of facilities and holding a validly
issued building or moving permit of the city, temporarily raise, lower, or
relocate its wires or other facilities as may be required for the person to
exercise the rights under the permit within 48 hours prior to the date upon
which said person intends to exercise its rights under said permit; provided,
however, that the franchisee may require such permit holder to make payment
in advance for any expenses incurred by said franchisee pursuant to such
person's request.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.57 FRANCHISEE RESPONSIBLE FOR COSTS.



    A franchisee shall be responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by
the city that are directly associated with the franchisee's erecting,
installing, maintaining, operating, repairing, replacing, removing or
restoring its facilities in the rights-of-way. A franchisee shall be
responsible for its own costs incurred in removing or relocating its
facilities when required by the city due to city requirements relating to
maintenance and use of the rights-of-way for city purposes.



(Ord. 2005-1380, passed 6-9-05)



§ 119.58 INSURANCE AND BONDS.



   During the term of any franchise, a franchisee shall obtain and
maintain at its sole expense, all insurance and bonds required by this
chapter. Nothing contained in this chapter shall limit a franchisee's
liability to the city to the limits of insurance certified or carried.



   (A)   If a person submitting an application for a franchise in
accordance herewith has plans to build facilities in the city the person
shall file with their applications performance bonds with a surety company or
trust company or companies as surety or sureties solely for the protection of
the city in an amount determined by the City Council to be reasonable for the
proposed scope of the system to be effective. The determination of the amount
of the performance bond required shall be made in a non-discriminatory
manner. Said performance bond shall provide for the faithful performance of
any and all provisions of this chapter and franchisee's franchise, including
but not limited to construction and installation, maintenance, relocation,
communications franchise fee payment, and/or removal of any abandoned
facilities. Upon demonstration of the completion of the construction of the
system by franchisee to the city, the city shall reduce the amount of the
performance bond by 75%.



   (B)   Said performance bond shall indemnify the city in its own
right and as trustee, from any damages or losses arising out of the failure
of franchisee to faithfully perform and satisfactorily complete construction
of the system in accordance with this chapter and any agreement and ordinance
in connection herewith, including, but not limited to, the cost of removal of
any construction.



   (C)   The failure of franchisee to comply with its obligations under
this chapter or the franchise as determined by the city shall entitle the
city to draw against said performance bond.



   (D)   The rights reserved to the city with respect to the
performance bonds required hereunder are in addition to all other rights of
the city, whether reserved by this chapter or authorized by law, and no
action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such performance
bond shall affect any other rights the city may have.



   (E)   The performance bonds required hereunder shall not expire or
be materially altered without 30 days written notice and without securing and
delivering to the city a substitute, renewal and replacement bond in
conformance with this chapter. In the event the city does draw monies against
the performance bonds required hereunder, within ten days thereafter,
franchisee shall pay such funds to the bonding company as necessary to bring
said performance bonds back to the applicable principal, where it shall
continue to be maintained. The performance bonds required hereunder shall
contain the following endorsements:



   "It is hereby understood and agreed that this performance bond may not
be reduced, altered or canceled by franchisee or the bonding company without
30 days written notice, by certified mail, to the City Clerk."



   (F)   Immediately upon the effective date of the resolution granting
a franchise under this chapter, franchisee shall file with the City Clerk the
following liability insurance policies issued by a company authorized to do
business in the Commonwealth and acceptable to the City Council:



         (1)   General liability: one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) each occurrence, five million dollars ($5,000,000.00)
aggregate, against bodily injury, death, or property damage.



         (2)   Automobile insurance: one million ($ 1 million)
each occurrence, and aggregate against bodily injury, death, or property
damage for any of franchisee's owned or leased motor vehicles used in the
construction/installation of any lines, facilities or equipment authorized by
the franchise.



         (3)   Workers compensation: the amount required by
Kentucky Revised Statutes.



   (G)   Franchisee shall maintain on file with the City Clerk a
certified copy of the insurance policy(s) specifically endorsed to include
all liability assumed by franchisee hereunder and a certificate of insurance
certifying the coverage required under this chapter, which certificate shall
be subject to the approval of the city as to the adequacy of the certificate
and of the insurance certified under the requirements of this chapter. Such
policy(s) and certificate shall be identified on their face by the name of
franchisee, and shall be submitted to the City Clerk, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this chapter. Failure to maintain adequate insurance
as required under this chapter shall be deemed a breach of the franchise.



   (H)   Franchisee shall maintain public liability, property damage
and other insurance required by this chapter that protects franchisee and the
city, its officers, agents, employees and appointed and elected officials
from any and all claims for damages or personal injury including death,
demands, actions, and suits brought against any of them arising from
operations under the franchise or in connection therewith. This insurance
coverage constitutes a minimum requirement and shall in no way be deemed to
lessen, limit or define the liability of franchisee, related entities, its
successors or assigns, under the terms of the franchise.



   (I)   The City Council reserves the right to make increases in the
amount of insurance coverage referred to in this section at any time.

existed prior to the commencement of the work.



      (4)   The costs associated with both the disturbance and the
return, replacement, and/or restoration shall be borne by franchisee.



   (C)   Aerial construction. Aerial construction of facilities must be
specifically authorized by the city prior to construction and located to
minimize interference with the other uses of the rights-of-way and other
public properties, and interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners whose property adjoins any of the
rights-of-way and other public properties. The decision to authorize above
ground construction shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. If other
franchisees have facilities above ground and there is capacity available,
above ground installations shall be permitted until such time as all
franchisees are required to relocate underground. Aerial facilities shall be
moved underground at franchisee's own cost upon request from the city or when
other users of the same rights-of-way convert to underground facilities.

any way to alleviate franchisee's responsibilities and obligations to the

directly or indirectly employed by franchisee, shall conduct such operations

chapter if a franchisee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence
that:



   (A)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare;



   (B)   Franchisee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and
the potential adverse impact on franchisee's construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively
prohibits the ability of franchisee to provide communications services in the
city; and



   (C)   Franchisee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably

§ 130.04  HERBAL INCENSE PRODUCTS PROHIBITED.

      (1)   The city finds that herbal incense products marketed in
the United States that provide a marijuana-like high when smoked have become
increasingly popular, particularly among teens and young adults and that
these products consist of plant material that has been laced with chemicals
that have not been approved by the FDA for human consumption.



      (2)   The city further finds that the Commonwealth of Kentucky
has moved to prohibit the sale and possession of similar products, but the
changing nature of the products has resulted in the availability of herbal
incense products that exceed the Commonwealth's definition and statutes and
therefore are not properly regulated by the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  The
city is aware that the side effects of the unregulated herbal incense
products pose a threat to the public health and safety of the citizens of the
city and it is in the best interests of the city to regulate the sale and use
of such products.

order and security of the city and its inhabitants by prohibiting a person
from intentionally or recklessly appearing or being nude, or causing another
person to appear or be nude, in a public place and in other places which may
be expected to be observed by the public within the city, except:



      (1)   When such person appears nude in a place provided or set

within such place provided or set apart for nudity; and

obtaining money or other financial gain for such person or for another person
or entity.



      (2)   When the conduct of being nude cannot legally be

         (a)   It constitutes a part of a bona fide live

conduct of appearing nude in public places, that, the acts prohibited in §

prostitution, attempted rape, rape, and assault and battery, that actual and
simulated nudity and/or sexual conduct begets and has the potential for
betting undesirable and unlawful behavior; that sexual, lewd, lascivious and
salacious conduct may result in violation of law and creates dangers to the
health, safety, welfare and morals of the public and those who engage in such
conduct.

judgement of the City Fire Marshal the use of the streets, alleys, or public
ways for such purpose shall not materially interfere with the rights of the
traveling public or create a traffic hazard of any kind, the permit may be
issued to the applicant when he has complied with the other provisions of
this section.



   (C)   Any person, firm, company, or corporation applying for a
period to use the streets, alleys, and other public ways of the city for the
purpose of moving buildings or other structures thereon shall obtain and file
with the City Fire Marshal a liability policy of insurance insuring the City
of Murray and the general public against damages resulting from any
negligence in connection with the use of the streets, alleys, and other
public ways for the purpose of moving buildings or other structures thereon,
or as a result of the negligence of the city, its officers, agents or
employees.  Said policy shall protect the city against any liability which
may be imposed by law on it by reason of the use of the streets, alleys, or
other public ways for that purpose.  The liability policy shall be in the
sum of not less than $500,000 (five hundred thousand dollars) for the injury
or death of any one (1) person and not less than $1,000,000 (one million
dollars) for the injury or death of all persons affected by any one (1)

(1) benefit of any person who may suffer property damage in any one accident
resulting from the use of streets, alleys, and other public ways for the
purpose of moving buildings or other structures thereon.  The policy of
insurance shall, as to the form thereof and the solvency of the insurance
company, be subject to the approval of the City Fire Marshal.  Said policy
shall be delivered to the City Fire Marshal before a permit is issued and
said policy shall be kept in full force and effect until the Street
Superintendent has furnished to the City Fire Marshal a certification in
writing that the moving work has been competed. The City Marshal is
authorized and empowered to surrender for cancellation any liability policy
after the City Fire Marshal has received from the Street Superintendent a
written certification that the moving of the building or other structure for
which the permit is granted has been completed.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 152.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS 82.082
delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the City Council, hereby adopts the following
floodplain management ordinance as follows.



(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)



§ 152.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and
by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage.



(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)



§ 152.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss
due to flooding by provisions designed to:



      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;



      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the
time of initial construction;



      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood
waters;



      (4)   Control tilling, grading, dredging, and other
development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and;



      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers
which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards
to other areas.



   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are to:



      (1)   Protect human life and health;



      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;



      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts
associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the
general public;



      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;



      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such
as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and
bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;



      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other
flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas
caused by flooding; and



      (7)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that
property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.



      (8) Ensure that those who occupy a Special Flood Hazard Area
assume responsibility for their actions.

which the principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or
a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly,
but waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of
100-year flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not
determined.



   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).” A structure located
on the same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which
is incidental to the use of the principle structure. “ACCESSORY

is complete these areas will still experience residual flooding from other
flooding sources.



   “A99 ZONE.” That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood
which is to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood

   “FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA.” Any land area susceptible to
being inundated by flood waters from any source.



   “FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.” The individual appointed by a NFIP
participating community to administer and enforce the floodplain management
ordinances.



   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.” The operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving

to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
ordinances, and open space plans.



   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other
applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any
combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.



   “FLOODPROOFING.” Any combination of structural and non-structural

flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation
facilities, structures, and their contents.



   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the
time of certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with
attendant utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified

used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to
flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard
must be applied not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofing level, but also to the level of protection provided to all
components of the structure, such as building utilities, HVAC components, etc.



   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.” As related in § 152.56, Appeals and
Variance Procedures, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must
not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this
requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every newly
constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part
of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In
addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject
to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.

   “HAZARD POTENTIAL.” The possible adverse incremental consequences
that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a
dam or misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential
classification of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of
a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity,
flood routing capacity).



   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the
ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.



   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:



      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic
Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily

      (1)   Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the
payment of a claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain
management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a
building covered by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy under the NFIP sustains
a loss and the state or community declares the building to be substantially
or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000 for the cost to
elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building.



      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and
non-residential buildings (this category includes public or government
buildings, such as schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under
the NFIP.

obstruction (except those constructed by the Department of Highways) across
or along any stream, or in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and
specifications for such work have been submitted by the person or political
subdivision responsible for the construction, reconstruction or improvement
and such plans and specifications have been approved in writing by the
cabinet and a permit issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt
those dams, embankments or other obstructions, which are not of such size or
type as to require approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or
retention of water supply.



      (2)   No person, city, county, or other political subdivision
of the state shall commence the filling of any area with earth, debris, or
any other material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a
building, barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to
a river or stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling,
raising, or obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the
channel or in the floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for
such work have been submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit
issued as required in division (1) above.



      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet
any jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction,
improvement, enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district,
ditch or system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval
of the same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is
determined by the cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial
use of water resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision
in control thereof so notified. The Department for Natural Resources through
KRS Chapter 350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151
concerning the regulation of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges,
fills, or other obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of
any stream which structures are permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface
coal mining operations.

levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices,
which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering
practices.



      (2)   For a levee system to be recognized, the following
criteria must be met:



         (a)   All closure devices or mechanical systems for
internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in
accordance with an officially adopted operation manual (a copy of which must
be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition

natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a
structure's foundation system.



   “LOWEST FLOOR.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely
for parking of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a

such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.



   “MANUFACTURED HOME.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used
with or without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the
required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers,
and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive
days or longer and intended to be improved property. The term “manufactured
home” does not include a “recreational vehicle” {see “Recreational
Vehicle”).

by a letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map
panel. The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has
been revised. (The letter "A" is not used by FEMA, the letter "B" is the
first revision.)



   “MARKET VALUE.” The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed
between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real

certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (Actual
Cash Value) or adjusted assessed values.



   “MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL).” The average height of the sea for all
stages of the tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program,
the MSL is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the

§ 152.08  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.



   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the City of
Murray, dated September 29, 2010, with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMS), other supporting data and any subsequent amendments thereto,
are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these
regulations by the city, and for those land areas acquired by the city
through annexation. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of
applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other
areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to
the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator and are enacted by City
Council pursuant to statutes governing land use management regulations. The
FIS and/or FIRM are permanent records of Murray and are on file and available
for review by the public during regular business hours at Murray City Hall.

structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not furthered, extended, or
replaced.



(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)



§ 152.41  SPECIFIC STANDARDS.



   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have
been provided, as set forth in § 152.08, the following provisions are
required:



   (A)   Residential construction.



      (1)   New construction or substantial improvement of any
residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than
one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter
walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with
standards of division (C).



         (a)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent
grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on
the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if
no depth number is specified.



         (b)   In an A zone, where no technical data has been
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one foot above
the base flood elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain
Administrator will determine the method by which base flood elevations are
determined. Methods include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, use of
historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no
data can be produced. Tide 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations)
Chapter 4, Regulation 060, states as a part of the technical requirements for
a state floodplain permit: The applicant shall provide cross sections for
determining floodway boundaries (and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any
proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross
sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error
tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections
elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks
in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain
change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and
shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the cabinet. If
necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet
may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations which
extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary
calculations.



         (c)   In all other zones, elevated one foot above the
base flood elevation.



      (2)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of
the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building
inspection department to be properly elevated. Such certification and
verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.



   (B)   Non-residential Construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) or together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities:



      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation 1 foot above the
level of the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;



      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;



      (3)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical
equipment, and ductwork, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of
the base flood elevation, or;



      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall
certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in §
152.25(B)(1)(c).



      (5)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division
(D).



      (6)   All new construction and substantial improvement with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which
are subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant188 materials
below an elevation one foot above the base flood elevation, and, shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA
Technical Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:



         (a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect; or



         (b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwater.



   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial
improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that
include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls
below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living
space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.



      (1)   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the
following minimum criteria:



         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total
net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding;



         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation
or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and



         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow
of floodwaters in both directions.



      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard
exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and



      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.



   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.



      (1)   All new or substantially improved manufactured homes
placed on sites located within A, Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new
construction, including elevation and anchoring. Locations include:



         (a)   On individual lots or parcels;



         (b)   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks
or subdivisions;



         (c)   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;



         (d)   In substantially improved manufactured home parks
or subdivisions;



         (e)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;



         (f)   In an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred
“substantial damage” as the result of a flood;



      (2)   All Manufactured homes must be:



         (a)   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and



         (b)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than one
foot above the level of the base flood elevation; and



         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.



      (3)   Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial
damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be
elevated so that the manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement, so that either the:



         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is
elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation;



         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by
reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent
strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent
grade.



         (c)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located
within A, Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map

days;



            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use;
or



            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new
construction of this chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements
for “manufactured homes”.



            4.   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the state motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.



   (E)   Flood ways. Located within areas of special flood hazard
established in § 152.08, are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the
following provisions shall apply:



      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless
certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood
discharge;



      (2)   If division (E) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§ 152.40 through
152.46.



(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)



§ 152.42 STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.



   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 152.08,
are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:



   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures shall:



      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to
or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade.



      (2)   In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest
floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the
highest adjacent grade.



   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of
non-residential structures shall:



      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to
or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade.
In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent
grade.



      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities
be completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in
Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in division (B).



(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)



§ 152.43 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.



   (A)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood
hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage;



   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;



   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and,



      (1)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is
not available (Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway
data for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.



      (2)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of
proposed structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above
the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade
elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
surveyor and provided to the Floodplain Administrator.



(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)



§ 152.44 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
(UNNUMBERED A ZONES;) AND/OR FLOODWAYS.



   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 152.08,
where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where
base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions
apply:



   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall
be located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community.



   (B)   The engineering certification should be supported by technical
data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. New
construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or
flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with § 152.08.



(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)



§ 152.45  STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH
THE LETTER ‘A.’



   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated
‘A’ the following provisions shall apply:



   (A)   Structure must be non-habitable;



   (B)   Must be anchored to resist floatation forces;



   (C)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one foot above
grade, total openings are to be one square inch per one square foot of floor
area, at least two openings required on opposite walls;



   (D)   Built of flood resistant materials below a level one foot
above the base flood elevation;



   (E)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;



   (F)   Can only be used for storage or parking;



   (G)   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.



(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)



§ 152.46  CRITICAL FACILITIES.



   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain).
Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the
floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the
SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of
the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must
be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released
into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base
flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent
possible.

ADMINISTRATION



§ 152.55  DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR.



   (A)   The City Council hereby appoints the Mayor or designee to
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter by granting
or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions, and is
herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.



   (B)   Duties and responsibilities of the Local Administrator. The
Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed, authorized and
directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter.
The Floodplain Administrator is further authorized to render interpretations
of this chapter, which are consistent with its spirit and purpose by granting
or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions. The duties
and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not
be limited to the following:



      (1)   Permit review. Review all development permits to ensure
that:



         (a)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been
satisfied;



         (b)   All other required state and federal permits have
been obtained: review proposed development to assure that all necessary
permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which

         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible
manner;



         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect
the carrying capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter,
"adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development
will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot at any point.



      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base
flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with § 152.08, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state
agency, or other source, in order to administer §§ 152.40 through 152.46.
Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for adoption.



      (3)   Notification of other agencies:



         (a)   Notify adjacent communities, the Kentucky Division
of Water, and any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or
regulatory authority prior to any alteration or relocation of the
watercourse; and



         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the
Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA);
and



         (c)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.



      (4)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and
maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:



         (a)   Certification required by § 152.41(A) (lowest
floor elevations) as shown on a completed and certified elevation
certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially
improved structures, in accordance with § 152.25(B)(2).



         (b)   Certification required by § 152.41(B)(elevation
or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) as shown on a completed and
certified floodproofing certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation
(in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved
structures have been flood-proofed, in accordance with § 152.25(B)(2).



         (c)   Certification required by § 152.41(C)(elevated
structures);



         (d)   Certification of elevation required by § 152.43
(subdivision standards);



         (e)   Certification required by § 152.41(E) (floodway
encroachments);



         (f)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying
capacity is not diminished;



         (g)   Review certified plans and specifications for
compliance;



         (h)   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations
of this chapter as specified in § 152.99.



      (5)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed,
as to the exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas,
for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions.



         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual
field conditions) the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
152.56(C).



         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data
have not been provided in accordance with Article 3, Section B, then the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonable utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or
other source, in order to administer the provisions of §§ 152.40 through
152.46;



         (c)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular
structure, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a
registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
152.41(A)(2) a floodproofing certificate;



         (d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this
chapter shall be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and
shall be open for public inspection.



      (6)   Right of entry.



         (a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to
enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, or whenever the administrator
has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon
any premises any condition or ordinance violation which makes such building,
structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the administrator may
enter such building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect
the same or perform any duty imposed upon the administrator by this chapter.



         (b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, he/she
shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building,
structure, or premises are unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable
effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such
request entry.



         (c)   If entry is refused, the administrator shall have
recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.



         (d)   When the administrator shall have first obtained a
proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no
owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any
building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request
is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the
administrator for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this
chapter.



      (7)   Stop work orders.



         (a)   Upon notice from the administrator, work on any
building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions
of this chapter shall immediately cease.



         (b)   Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the person doing the
work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed.



      (8)   Revocation of permits.



         (a)   The administrator may revoke a permit or approval,
issued under the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or
plans on which the permit or approval was based.



         (b)   The administrator may revoke a permit upon
determination by the administrator that the construction, erection,
alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the
structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in
conformity with, the provisions of this chapter.



      (9)   Liability. Any officer, employee, or member of the
floodplain administrator's staff, charged with the enforcement of this
chapter, acting for the applicable governing authority in the discharge of
his or her duties, shall not thereby render himself or herself personally
liable, and is hereby relieved from all personal liability, for any damage
that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act required or
permitted in the discharge of his duties. Any suit brought against any
officer, employee, or member because of such act performed by him or her in
the enforcement of any provision of this chapter shall be defended by the
department of law until the final termination of the proceedings.



      (10)   Expiration of Floodplain Construction Permit. A
floodplain construction permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall
expire if the holder of a floodplain construction permit has not commenced
construction within 180 calendar days from the date of its issuance by the
Floodplain Administrator.



(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)



§ 152.56  APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Nature of variances.



      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the
ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances
pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may
be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual
that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an
exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. 
The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by
adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself,
not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.



      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its
citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of
the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that
variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood
ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and
contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be
properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in
which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.



   (B)   Designation of Variance and Appeal Board. The City Council of
Murray shall establish an Appeal Board consisting of the Board of Zoning
Adjustment.



   (C)   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.



      (1)   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall hear and decide
requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of
decisions or determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.



      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of
Zoning Adjustment or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local
Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.



   (D)   Appeals/Variance Procedures. In passing upon such
applications, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections
of this chapter, and the:



      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;



      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;



      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual
owner and future owners of the property;



      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by
the proposed facility;



      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront,
in the case of functionally dependent facility;



      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not
subject to flooding or erosion damage;



      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;



      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;



      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;



      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,



      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and
bridges.



   (E)   Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.



      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.



      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the
flood hazard. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum
of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case
of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the Board of Zoning
Adjustment need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or
even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation
which the Board of Zoning Adjustment believes will both provide relief and
preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.



      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the
flood hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination
shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and
not destroy the historic character and design of the structure.



      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:



         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this
chapter); and



         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood height, additional threats to public
safety, cause extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in
the definition section under “Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud
or victimization of the public (as defined in the definition section) or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.



      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood
elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.



      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records
of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon
request.



      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of §
152.56(D)(1) through (11) are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the
base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and
does not create a public nuisance.



   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is
granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community
official that:



      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage,
and;



      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the City Clerk and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of tide of the affected
parcel of land.



      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of
all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report
such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.



   (G)   Historic Structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see definition) upon determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.



   (H)   No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall
not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

§ 152.57  ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATION NOTICE.



   (A)   Criminal offense. If, at any time, development occurs which is
not in accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit
and any approved modifications, such development shall constitute a
misdemeanor criminal offense.



   (B)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized
employee or agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to
believe that a person has caused development to occur which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit
and any approved modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the
Floodplain Administrator shall issue a notice to the person responsible for
the violation and/or the property owner, stating the facts of the offense or
violation, the section of this ordnance and/or of the permit violated, when
it occurred, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development
into conformity with this chapter or with the approved permit, and within
what period of time the remedy is to occur, which period of time shall be
reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the violation and whether
or not it creates a nuisance or hazard.



The remedy may include an order to stop work on the development. The notice
shall also state that a misdemeanor charge may be forthcoming in the event
that the requested remedies and corrective actions are not taken, which
citation will request a criminal fine and shall state the maximum fine and
penalties which could be imposed.



(Ord. 2010-1515, passed 9-23-10)



§ 152.99  PENALTY.



   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions,
shall constitute a misdemeanor criminal offense. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon
conviction thereof, be fined no less than $250 or imprisoned for not more
than 90 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses
involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Floodplain
Administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent
or remedy any violation.

(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)



§ 155.06  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



   The Planning Commission shall impose the following general requirements
and compel all subdividers to comply with the following principles of design
in the layout of subdivisions:



   (A)   Suitability of land for subdivision.



      (1)   Land not suitable for development.



         (a)   Flood hazards.  Land within the floodway shall
not be platted for residential occupancy or building sites.  Other land
subject to flooding may be platted for residential occupancy or for such
other uses which will not increase the danger to health, life and property. 
Fill may not be used to raise land in the floodway areas except where express
permission has been granted by the Planning Commission.  In other areas
subject to flood, fill may be used providing the proposed fill does not
restrict the flow of water and unduly increase flood heights. In applying
this provision land below the elevation of the Regional Flood (Regulated) on
the East Fork Clarks River shall be considered subject to flood.  The
elevation of this flood shall be determined from the chart, "Natural and
Regulated High Water Profiles, East Fork Clarks River, Vicinity of Murray,
Kentucky" (Tennessee Valley Authority, October, 1968), which chart is made a
part of these regulations.  Areas included in the floodway are as shown on
the map.  "Floodway, East Fork Clarks River, Vicinity of Murray, Kentucky"
(Tennessee Valley Authority, November, 1968).



         (b)   Other conditions.  If the Planning Commission
finds that land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision
development due to bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, and other
such conditions as may increase the danger of health, life, or property, or
aggravate erosion or flood hazards; and, if from adequate investigations,
conducted by all the public agencies concerned, it has been determined that
in the best interest of the public the land or a portion thereof not be
platted and developed for the purpose proposed, the Planning Commission shall
not approve the land or portions thereof for subdivision.



      (2)   Premature development.  The Planning Commission may
refuse to approve what it considers to be scattered or premature subdivision
of land which would involve danger or injury to the public health, safety,
welfare, or prosperity by reason of lack of adequate water supply, schools,
proper drainage, good roads and transportation facilities, or other public
services; or which would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds
for the supply of such services.



   (B)   Community assets.  In all subdivisions, due regard shall be
shown for natural features such as large trees, unusual rock formations, and
water courses; for sites which have historical significance; and for similar
assets which if preserved will add attractiveness and value to the
subdivision and to the community.  The Planning Commission may prepare a
list of all such features within its area of subdivision jurisdiction which
it deems worthy of preservation.



   (C)   Large tracts or parcels.  When land is subdivided into larger
parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to
allow for the opening of future streets and logical resubdivision.



   (D)   Mobile home parks.  Mobile home parks must conform to:



      (1)   Statutory requirements.



      (2)   Design requirements as set forth in the zoning code.



      (3)   The procedure for plat approval for a mobile home park
is the same as subdivision, and to be according to §§ 155.40 through 155.50.



   (E)   Multi-building development.



      (1)   Compliance with this regulation.  Where multi-building
development occurs, the developer must establish lot lines for each principal
building and lot.  The developer must establish setback lines to meet all
other requirements of this regulation and the zoning code where applicable. 
Preliminary and final plats shall be presented to the Planning Commission in
accordance with this regulation.



      (2)   Variance.  A variance from this chapter may be granted
for multi-building development if it is shown that the land in question can
not be subdivided or that more open space is created, a lower density can be
established, traffic problems are lessened, and a better relation between
land and building is created by not subdividing the land. However, in no case
shall the Planning Commission grant a variance which does not comply with the
zoning code, where applicable, or which destroys the character of the
neighborhood.



(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)  Penalty, see § 155.99



MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS



§ 155.10  STREETS.



   The design of a subdivision shall conform to the following design
standards:



   (A)   Conformity to the major street plan.  The width and locations
of all streets in a proposed subdivision will conform to the Major Street
Plan.



   (B)   Relation to topography.  Streets shall be designed with
respect to topography to produce the most usable and properly situated lots,
provide proper drainage for storm water, and produce proper grades.



   (C)   Street extensions.



      (1)   Extension of present streets.  The street layout of the
proposed subdivision shall provide for the continuation or extension of
streets already existing in areas adjacent to the area being subdivided
unless the Planning Commission deems such continuation or extension
undesirable for specific reasons of topography or design.



      (2)   Extension of proposed streets.  Where, in the opinion
of the Planning Commission, it is desirable to provide street access to
adjoining properties, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the
boundaries of such properties.  Where the Planning Commission deems it
necessary, such dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary
turn-around having a radius of at least 40 feet.



      (3)   Required width.  The street system for the proposed
subdivision shall provide for extending existing streets at the same or
greater width, but in no case shall a street extension be of less width than
the minimum width required in these regulations for a street in its category.



   (D)   Dedication of right-of-way.



      (1)   New streets.  The dedication of rights-of-way for new
streets measured from the lot line to the lot line shall be as shown on the
General Plan, or if not shown thereon, shall meet the following standards.




   Street Type   Right-of-Way (Feet)





   Arterial streets   80





   Collector streets   60





   Minor streets - through streets   50





   Minor streets - local streets





   (cul-de-sacs less than 400





   feet with only single dwell-





   ing units and loop streets





   "off collectors less than





   2,000 feet around" with only





   single family dwelling units)   50




      (2)   Maximum dedication.  The Major Street Plan may indicate
greater right-of-way widths for certain arterial streets, but in no case
shall the subdivider be required to dedicate a right-of-way width of more
than 80 feet for any one street.



      (3)   Arterial streets with controlled access.  All streets
classified as arterial streets by the General Plan may be considered as
limited access in accordance with KRS 177.220 through 177.310, defined herein
as controlled access.  All points of access shall be as approved by the
Planning Commission.



      (4)   Marginal access streets. Where the proposed subdivision
abuts upon or contains an existing or proposed arterial street or highway on
which traffic volumes and vehicular speeds warrant special safety
considerations, the Planning Commission may require that marginal access
streets be provided in order that no lots will front on such existing or
proposed arterial street or highway.



      (5)   Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs).  Minor terminal or
dead-end streets or courts which are designed so as to have one end
permanently closed shall not be longer than 500 feet and shall be provided at
the closed end with a turn-around having a radius at the outside of the
right-of-way of at least 50 feet.



      (6)   Alleys.  Alleys shall be provided to give access to the
rear of all lots used for business and industrial purposes.  Alleys shall
not be provided in residential blocks except in cases where the subdivider
produces evidence of the need for alleys which is satisfactory to the
Planning Commission.



      (7)   Existing streets.



         (a)   Subdivision on both sides of street.  Where the
subdivision is on both sides of an existing street, sufficient right-of-way
shall be dedicated to give the street the required right-of-way.



         (b)   Subdivision on one side of street.  Where the
subdivision is to take place on only one side of a street, one-half of the
right-of-way needed to give the street the required right-of-way shall be
dedicated.



      (8)   Increased right-of-way necessary.  If the Planning
Commission deems it necessary, street rights-of-way through commercial zones
or present on proposed business areas shall be increased ten feet on each
side for needed parking.



      (9)   Extraordinary physical conditions.  If the Planning
Commission deems it necessary where extraordinary physical conditions exist,
the Planning Commission may alter the right-of-way requirements.



      (10)   Streets along property lines.  Where a proposed street
runs along a property line of the proposed subdivision, the street
right-of-way, pavement, and other requirements must be met in full.



      (11)   Conflicting traffic or land use.  When a proposed
subdivision contains or is adjacent to existing or proposed railroad
rights-of-way, arterial street right-of-way, other significant rights-of-way,
or conflicting and detrimental land uses; the Planning Commission may require
marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots, lots with rear service
alleys, lots with additional depth, or other measures which may be necessary
for protection of abutting properties and the maintenance or function of
major traffic arteries.



   (E)   Private streets and reserve strips.



      (1)   There shall be no private streets platted within a
subdivision.



      (2)   There shall be no reserve strips in a subdivision except
where their control is definitely vested in the city or county under
conditions approved by the Planning Commission as authorized in these
regulations.



   (F)   Street intersections.



      (1)   Number of approaches. Intersections involving more than
four basic street approaches shall be prohibited.  Merging lanes and
deceleration lanes are considered as parts of one street approach.



      (2)   Angle at intersection.  For a tangent distance of at
least 100 feet, measured from the intersection of right-of-way lines, all
streets should intersect at an angle of 90 degrees.  In no case shall the
angle of intersection be less than 75 degrees.



      (3)   Radii at intersection. Street curb and edge
intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least 20 feet.

      (2)   Grades for drainage.  All streets shall be designed so
as to provide for the discharge of surface water from the pavement and from
the right-of-way by grading and drainage.  For adequate drainage, the
minimum street grade shall not be less than one-half of one percent.



      (3)   Excessive grades at intersections.  When a street grade
at the approach to an intersection exceeds three percent, a leveling area
shall be provided with grades of not greater than three percent for a
distance of 50 feet from the intersection of street center- lines. Vertical
curves shall then be used to connect the intersecting grades.



   (J)   Street elevations.



      (1)   Streets shall be flood free.  The Planning Commission
shall not approve streets which will be subject to inundation or flooding. 
All streets must be located at elevations which will make them flood free in
order that portions of the subdivision will not be isolated by floods. 
Where flood conditions exist, the Planning Commission shall require profiles
and elevations of streets in order to determine the advisability of
permitting the proposed subdivision activity.



      (2)   Fills.  Fill may be used in areas subject to flooding
in order to provide flood-free streets if such fill does not unduly increase
flood heights. Drainage openings shall be designed as not to restrict the
flow of water and thereby unduly increase flood heights.  Such fills and
openings shall be approved by the City Engineer.



   (K)   Access to lots.



      (1)   Lots on or near arterial streets.  Access to lots
abutting only on arterial rights-of-way shall conform to § 155.10 (D) (3)
but in no case shall the access be closer than 125 feet from an
intersection.  A lot which abuts a street which intersects an arterial shall
have access only to the nonarterial street at a distance of not less than 75
feet from the intersection.



      (2)   Lot on or near collector streets.  A lot which abuts
only on a collector shall have access to the lot at a distance not less than
75 feet from an intersection.  A lot which abuts a minor street which
connects with a collector shall have access to only the minor street at a
distance not greater than 50 feet from the collector.



      (3)   Minor streets.  Lots which abut only on minor streets
shall have access at a distance not greater than 50 feet from an
intersection.  Lots that abut on a cul-de-sac shall have access only to a
cul-de-sac.



      (4)   Marginal access streets. Lots abutting on marginal
access streets shall have access at a distance no greater than 75 feet from
an intersection. If a lot abuts both an arterial street or collector and a
marginal access street, access shall be given only along the marginal access
street.



      (5)   Alleys.  All nonresidential lots may have access to an
alley, except that an alley cannot be used as the primary access point to a
commercial or industrial use or other uses which generate a large volume of
traffic.



      (1)   Street names.



      (1)   Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with
other already existing and named streets shall bear the names of such
existing streets.



      (2)   The name of a proposed street which is not in alignment
with an existing street shall not duplicate the name of any existing street,
irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive,
place, court, lane, road, pike, highway, parkway, or similar suffix.

§ 155.11  BLOCKS.



   The design of a subdivision shall conform to the following design
standards:



   (A)   Length.  Block lengths shall not exceed 1200 feet or less
than 500 feet, except as the Planning Commission considers necessary to
secure efficient use of land or desired features of street layout.



   (B)   Midblock walks.  Blocks over 753 feet in length may be
required to have a midblock walk near the center of the block connecting the
streets on either side of the long block.  The right-of-way for such walks
shall not be less than five feet in width.



   (C)   Width.  Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of
lots of minimum depth.  However, where this would require lots to front on
an arterial street or highway or where topographical conditions or the size
of the property prevent two tiers of lots, the Planning Commission may
approve a single tier of lots of minimum depth.



(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)  Penalty, see § 155.99



§ 155.12  LOTS.



   The design of a subdivision shall conform to the following design
standards:



   (A)   Relationship to streets.  All lots shall front on a public
street or road for a minimum distance of 75 feet except those lots which
front on the turn-arounds of permanent dead-end streets or on curves, shall
front on such turn-arounds or curves for a minimum distance of 40 feet.



   (B)   Development of hazardous areas. When lots are located on land
which is subject to flooding, subsidence, or other hazards injurious to the
health and safety of potential users; and when such hazards cannot be
eliminated or adequate safeguards provided to protect the health and safety
of potential users, the Planning Commission may declare such lots to be
unsuitable for development and disapprove such plans to develop or subdivide
such lots.



   (C)   Lot lines.  Side lot lines shall be at right angles to
straight street centerlines and radial to curved street centerlines.  Rear
lot lines should consist of straight lines with a minimum number of
deflections.



   (D)   Dimensions.  The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall
be such as the Planning Commission deems appropriate for the type of
development and use contemplated.  Lot dimensions shall comply to the zoning
code.



      (1)   Lots served by sewer.  In areas where no zoning code is
in effect, residential lots served by public sewer shall be at least 75 feet
wide at the building setback line and 7,500 square feet in area.



      (2)   Lots not served by sewer. In areas where no zoning code
is in effect, residential lots not served by public sewer shall have a
minimum lot area as determined by the County Health Officer based on
percolation tests and other health factors. However, in no case shall a lot
not served by public sewer be less than 85 feet in width at the building
setback line and less than 15,000 square feet in area.



      (3)   Lots served by wells.  The minimum width and minimum
area of residential lots to be served by individual private wells shall be
determined by the County Health Officer after investigation of soil
conditions, the proposed sewerage system, and the depth of ground water.



   (E)   Building setback line.



      (1)   Required setback line.  The building setback line shall
meet the requirements of the zoning code.  Where the zoning code is not in
effect, the building setback line, for all lots, including double-frontage
and corner lots, shall be no less than 25 feet from the street right-of-way.



      (2)   Variance from established setback lines.  Once a
setback line in an area of a subdivision is established, all buildings shall
be built on this line. However, with the permission of the Planning
Commission, setback lines in residential subdivisions may be varied ten feet
from the established setback lines, but shall not be closer to the street
right-of-way than the established building line.  Permission can only be
granted if it is shown that the privacy of the homes and yards in question is
maintained.  The permission shall be recorded on the final plat.  The
Planning Commission may review the building construction plans where
permission is granted, and require changes that will maintain privacy.



      (3)   Obstructions to vision at street intersections
prohibited.  Corner lots in all districts, except the central business
district, shall be free from all obstructions to traffic visibility between
points 95 feet, measured along the street center line, from the intersection
of the center lines.  The requirements of this section shall not be deemed
to prohibit any necessary retaining wall.



   (F)   Yard requirements.  Yard requirements for residential
subdivisions or the portions thereof inside the corporate limits shall be the
same as the yard requirements set forth in the zoning code for the zoning
district or districts in which they are located.  Minimum yard requirements
for residential subdivisions or the portions thereof located where no zoning
code is in effect shall be as follows:



   Front yard   25 feet



   Rear yard   25 feet

   The design of a subdivision shall conform to the following design
standards:



   (A)   Required off-street parking in accordance with zoning
regulations. Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the
zoning code where the zoning code is in effect.



   (B)   Required off-street parking where there is no zoning code. 
Where the zoning code is not in effect, off-street parking space shall be
provided with vehicular access to a street or alley.  Parking space shall be
provided on the premises so that there will be no generation of automobile
parking on any street.  For purposes of computing the number of spaces
available in a given area, a standard vehicle parking space shall be computed
as an area measuring 10 by 20 feet.  Additional area will be required in
order to provide vehicle maneuvering space, access, and egress.



   (C)   The off-street parking standards where the zoning code is not
in effect. The following standards comprise the minimum off-street parking
requirements for the several common types of buildings and uses listed.

maximum capacity.  Employee parking shall be provided at the ratio of one
space for each three employees.



      (7)   Church - one parking space for each four seats, based on
maximum seating capacity.



      (8)   Office building - one parking space for each 300 square
feet of gross floor area in the building, exclusive of the area used for
storage, utilities, and building service.



      (9)   Industrial plants, research laboratories, nonretail
sales and service establishments - one parking space for every two employees
at maximum employment on a single shift plus one space for every truck
operated by the plant or establishment.



   (D)   Off-street loading and unloading regulations for trucks. 
Where the zoning code is not in effect all buildings and uses which generate
regular trucking traffic shall be provided with sufficient off-street loading
and unloading space on the premises so that they will generate no loading or
unloading activity on their required parking spaces or on any street. The
Planning Commission shall interpret the amount of loading and unloading space
required for any building or use whenever it is unable to apply this standard
literally.



   (E)   Additional parking, loading, and unloading regulations. 
Where the zoning code is not in effect, the arrangement of off-street parking
space shall be: off-street parking space required for any building or use may
be located within 400 feet from the premises it serves, but detached
therefrom, or may be consolidated into a large parking area serving other
buildings and uses.  Either arrangement must be approved by the Planning
Commission.  Such parking space, if allowed, shall be deemed required space
associated with the permitted use and shall not hereafter be reduced or
encroached upon in any manner.



      (1)   Proof of availability.  The Planning Commission may
require a plat, deed, and any other proof necessary to show that required
parking space, if located off the premises it serves, is controlled by and
available to the applicant prior to the granting of a building permit.



      (2)   Surfacing of parking, loading, and unloading spaces.

   The design of a subdivision shall conform to the following design
standards:



   (A)   Except where alleys are permitted for the purpose, the
Planning Commission shall require easements at least 12 feet in width
centered along all rear lot lines for poles, wires, conduits, storm sewers,
sanitary sewers, gas mains, water mains, heat mains, and other utility
facilities. Where necessary or advisable in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, similar easements shall be provided along side lot lines or
access lots.



   (B)   If a stream flows through or adjacent to the proposed
subdivisions, the plat plan shall provide for an easement or right-of-way
along the stream for a floodway.  For the smaller streams, the plan shall
also provide for channel improvement to enable them to carry all reasonable
floods within banks.  The floor elevations of houses shall be high enough to
be well above the extraordinary flood. The floodway easement shall be wide
enough to provide for future enlargement of the stream channel as adjacent
areas become more highly developed and runoff rates are increased.



   (C)   Connection to existing easements. When necessary, utility and
drainage easements shall connect with existing easements on adjoining
properties.

   The design of a subdivision shall conform to the following design
standards:



   (A)   Assessing the need for community facilities.  During the
review of subdivision plats the Planning Commission shall consider the
adequacy of existing or proposed community facilities which will serve the
additional population to be housed in a proposed subdivision. Subdividers
shall also give consideration to dedicating or reserving land for facilities
which will be needed in a subdivision, such as public buildings, recreational
areas, shopping facilities, schools, open space, and public access to
waterways and other public facilities.



   (B)   Adequacy of such areas.  Areas provided or reserved for such
community facilities shall be adequate for building sites, landscaping, and
off-street parking.

§ 155.20  COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS PR IOR TO APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT.



   No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission
or accepted for record by the County Clerk until the required improvements
listed above are constructed in a satisfactory manner and certified as such
by the developers' engineer and approved by the appropriate City or County
officials having jurisdiction.  In lieu of such prior construction, the
Planning Commission may accept a security bond or certified check running to
the appropriate city or county agencies in an amount equal to the estimated
cost of installation of the required improvements in accordance with §
155.48.

length and four inches in diameter or four inches square shall be set at all
corners on the plat.  The top of the monument shall be flat and shall have
an indented cross to properly identify the location.  Except in cases where
it is deemed clearly unreasonable or infeasible by the Planning Commission,
these monuments shall be described on the final plat in relation to the
located section corners of the coordinate system of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky until such time that the City Engineer or other authorized persons,
may establish triangulation points within the jurisdiction of the planning
unit.  After the triangulation points are established, the monuments shall
be described on the final plat in relation to the triangulation points and in
accordance with the regulations established by the City Engineer or other
authorized persons.

constructed on the same level plane.  Deviation from this standard due to
special topographical conditions will be allowed only with the special
approval of the Planning Commission.



      (1)   Preparation of the subgrade. Before grading is started,
the entire right-of-way area shall be first cleared of all tree stumps,
roots, brush, and other objectionable materials and of all trees not intended
for preservation.  The subgrade shall be properly shaped, rolled, and
uniformly compacted to conform with the accepted cross-section and grades.



      (2)   Cuts.  In cuts, all tree stumps, boulders, organic
material, soft clay, spongy material, and other objectionable material shall
be removed to a depth of at least two feet below the natural ground
surface.  This objectionable matter as well as similar matter from cuts
shall be removed from the right-of-way area and disposed of in such a manner
that it will not become incorporated in fills or hinder proper operation of
the drainage system.  The fill material shall be free from trash and other
foreign objects.

less than four inches in height and shall be constructed of portland cement
concrete. Backfill shall be higher than the curb and shall slope toward the
curb in order to insure that surface water drains into the storm drainage
system.



      (3)   Curb and gutter not necessary.  The Planning Commission
may waive the requirements for curb and gutter in single-family residential
developments if they are not deemed necessary for proper drainage and only
where all lots are greater than 200 feet in width at the building line.



      (4)   Requirements when curb and gutters are waived. 
Drainage ditches shall be constructed within the street right-of-way.  The
ditches shall be of adequate size to carry the runoff water and to prevent
flooding.  The Planning Commission may require concrete lined ditches or any
other improvements needed to prevent flooding and erosion.  The ditch line

sidewalks along the arterial street and on the inside of the marginal access
street.  Sidewalks shall be required on the outside of the marginal streets.



   (C)   Sidewalks adjacent to streets. Sidewalks within five feet of
the pavement shall be built at an elevation at or above the elevation of the
top of the curb.  In residential areas, the sidewalks shall be constructed
at least two feet from the curb except at street intersections.



   (D)   Sidewalk construction where curb and gutters are waived. 
Sidewalks shall be constructed between the ditch and the right-of-way line
where curb and gutters have been waived.  The sidewalks shall be built at
least two feet from the ditch line and shall not be built in the ditch or so
as to impede the flow of water in the ditch or as to cause erosion or
flooding. Sidewalks closer than five feet from the pavement shall be at an
elevation greater than that of the street or pavement.



   (E)   Sidewalks not necessary.  The Planning Commission may waive
the requirements in single-family unit development for sidewalks where it is
shown that sidewalks are not needed for the safety of the pedestrian, and
where circumstances make sidewalks impractical in the opinion of the Planning
Commission.

§ 155.33  STORM WATER CONVEYANCE FACILITIES AND WATER QUALITY DESIGN
CRITERIA.



   The following criteria shall control when designing storm water
conveyance facilities and water quality control structures:



   (A)   Open channels and roadside ditches. The design storm for the
design of open channels and roadside ditches shall be a storm with a
recurrence frequency of ten year/ 24-hour duration. The time of
concen-tration for open channel and roadside ditch design should be assumed
to be 15 minutes.



   (B)   Storm sewers and inlets. The design storm for the design of
storm sewers and inlets shall be the 25-year storm/24- hour duration (TR-55
Method and Rational Method). The duration of the peak rainfall event shall be
assumed to be equal to the calculated time of concentration. Storm sewers and
inlets shall be checked under 25-year storm/24-hour duration (TR-55 Method
and Rational Method) loading conditions for ponding limits. The ponding limit
for streets with curb and gutter shall be an eight-foot spread measured from
gutter to driving lane. Spread calculations shall be based upon an intensity
of four inches per hour. Pipes should be sized based upon the actual time of
concentration. The minimum time of concentration should be assumed to be
eight minutes.



   (C)   Entrance pipes and cross drains. The design storm for the
design of entrance pipes and cross drains shall be the 25-year storm/24-hour
duration (TR-55 Method and Rational Method). The duration of the peak
rainfall event shall be assumed to be equal to the calculated time of
concentration. The minimum time of concentration shall be assumed to be eight
minutes.  Entrance pipes and cross drains shall be checked for overtopping
of roadways and flood damage to affected areas. Situations requiring pipes
larger than 36 inches shall be designed using the culvert criteria in
division (D) of this section, below.



   (D)   Culverts and cross drains. The design storm for the
calculation of runoff for culvert design shall be the 25-year storm. The
duration of the peak rainfall event shall be assumed to be equal to the
calculated time of concentration.  The recommended check storm is the
100-year storm. The maximum headwater under 100-year storm conditions should
not be allowed to overtop roads or increase the flooding potential in the
affected areas.



   (E)   Erosion control. Plans for storm water conveyance systems
shall include appropriately designed temporary and perman-ent erosion-control
measures both for the open channel conduits and all disturbed land draining
to both open and closed conduits within the system. (Best Management
Prac-tices for Construction Activities prepared by the Kentucky Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet and § 155.36 of this
sub-chapter should be used as design guides for erosion and sediment control).



     (F)   Water quality control structures. The design rainfall event
for the design of all stormwater quality control structures shall be the
surface depth of runoff produced from an 80th percentile precipitation event.
Stormwater quality control structures shall be designed, built and maintained
to treat filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen, evapo-transpire, harvest and
reuse stormwater runoff, or otherwise manage the stormwater runoff quality
for the 80th percentile precipitation event. Green infrastructure devices may
be used as water quality control structures if they meet the design criteria.



   (G)   Design certification. Design of all storm water conveyance and
water quality facilities shall be prepared and stamped by a licensed
professional engineer (Kentucky registration required). Design methods shall
be in accor-dance with the Kentucky Department of Highways Manual of
Instructions for Drainage Design, latest edition.

quality of watercourses and water bodies in a manner pursuant to and
consistent with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit process by reducing pollutants in stormwater discharges and by
prohibiting non-stormwater discharges to the storm drain system.



   (B)   Applicability. This subchapter shall apply to all water
entering the storm drainage system and/or receiving waters generated on any
developed or undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the authorized
enforcement agency.



   (C)   Ultimate responsibility. The standards set forth herein and
promulgated pursuant to this subchapter are minimum standards: therefore this
subchapter does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will
ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized
discharge of pollutants into waters of the state caused by the person. This
subchapter shall not create liability on the City of Murray, or any agent or
employee thereof for any damages that result from any discharger’s reliance
on this subchapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.



   (D)   Severability. The provisions of this subchapter are hereby
declared to be severable. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of
this subchapter or the application thereof to any person, establishment or
circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the
other provisions or application of this subchapter.



   (E)   Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge
or cause to be discharged into the storm drainage system and or receiving
waters of the Commonwealth, any materials, including but not limited to
pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a
violation of applicable water quality standard, other than stormwater. The
commencement conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm
drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:

ordinance. The authorized enforcement agency is hereby empowered to seek
assistance from any court of competent jurisdiction in obtaining such entry.



   (J)   Requirements to prevent control, and reduce stormwater
pollutants. The owner and/or facility operator shall provide, at their own
expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the storm drainage system of watercourses
through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Any person
responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an
illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person’s expense,
additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the storm drainage system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity to the extent practicable
shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs
shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary
for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into
stormwater. the storm drainage system, or water of the State said person
shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials the person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of
non-hazardous materials, the person shall notify the authorized enforcement
agency in person, by phone, or by facsimile no later than the next business
day and written notice given no, later than three (3) business days of
initial notification. The owner or facility operator shall also retain an
onsite written record, for three (3)  years, of the discharge and the
actions taken to prevent its recurrence.



   (M)   Program enforcement.



      (1)   Suspension of MS4 access.



         (a)   In the event of an emergency, the authorized
enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to
a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to
public health, the environment, the MS4. or the waters of the state. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize the danger to the public, damage to the MS4 or waters of
the state.



         (b)   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of
this section may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would

discharges.



            3.   That violating discharges, practices, or
operations shall cease and desist.



            4.   The abatement or remediation_of stormwater
pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property.



            5.   Payment of penalty to cover administrative
and remediation costs, or



            6.   The implementation of source control or
treatment BMPs.



         (c)   If abatement of violation and/or restoration of
affected property are required, the notices shall set forth a deadline within
which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
advise that should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by a contractor and all expense
shall be charged to the violator.



      (3)   Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a
notice of violation may appeal, in writing, the determination of the
authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be received by the
office of Planning and Engineering, within 15 days from the date of the
notice of violation.



      (4)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has
not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the violation or
deadline, the enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private
property and is authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate

the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of the
abatement including administrative costs. The property owner may file a
written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment with 15 days of
notification. If the amount due is not paid within 30 days or by the date
expressed by the authorized enforcement agency, the charges shall become a
special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment. A copy of the resolution shall be
turned over the County Auditor so that the auditor may enter the amounts of
the assessment against the parcel as it appears on the current assessment
roll, and the tax collector shall include the amount of the assessment on the
bill for taxes levied against the parcel of land.



      (6)   Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person
to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of

VARIANCES



§ 155.60  VARIANCES FOR UNUSUAL PHYSICA L CONDITIONS.



   Where the Planning Commission finds that strict enforcement of these
regulations would create an undue hardship because of exceptional and unique
physical conditions that exist on the property to be subdivided, but not
usually found within the jurisdiction of the Murray Planning Unit, the
Planning Commission may modify these regulations to the extent necessary to
provide relief for the undue hardship; provided that such relief may be
granted without detriment to the public welfare and without substantially
impairing the intent and purpose of these regulations.  In granting such
variances or modifications, the Planning Commission may require such
conditions as will substantially secure the objectives of the standards or
requirements so varied or modified.  Financial disadvantage to the property
owner is no proof of hardship within the purpose of these regulations.



(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)



§ 155.61  VARIANCES FOR DESIGN INNOVATION AND LARGE-SCALE DEVELOPMENT.

case of plans for complete neighborhoods or other design innovations which ,
in the opinion of the Planning Commission, achieve the basic objectives of
these regulations.  The Planning Commission shall require those conditions,
such as covenants or other legal provisions, which it feels are necessary to
assure conformity to, and achievement of, the proposed subdivision plan;
however, overall density as established in the zoning code shall not be
reduced.



(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)



§ 155.62  VARIANCES IN CONFLICT WITH ZONING REGULATION.



   When a variance from the subdivision regulations is granted, and such
variance is also a variance from the zoning code, the variance shall only be
granted by the Planning Commission with the condition that the variance is
granted by the Board of Adjustments.  An application for a variance shall
first be considered by the Planning Commission, and then by the Board of
Adjustments shall have jurisdiction only where the zoning code is in effect,
and shall follow the procedure set forth in the zoning code.



(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)



AMENDMENTS AND LEGAL STATUS

hearing on the proposed changed after giving notice as required by KRS
Chapter 424.  It shall then make its recommendation on the proposed changes
to the City Council.  It shall take a majority of the entire City Council to
override the recommendations of the Planning Commission.

discrepancy between the minimum standards set forth in these regulations and
those contained in the zoning code, building code, or other official
regulations, the highest standard shall apply.



(Ord. 682, passed 2-22-79)

subdivision, or his agent, shall transfer or sell or agree to sell any lot or
parcel of land located within a subdivision by reference to, or by
exhibition, or by any other use of a plat of such subdivision, before such
plat has received final approval of the Planning Commission and recorded by
the County Clerk.  Any such instrument of transfer, sale, or contract shall
be void and shall not be subject to be recorded.  The description of lots or
parcels by metes and bounds in any contract or instrument of transfer or
other document used in the process of selling or transferring same shall not
exempt the person attempting to transfer from penalties provided or deprive
the purchaser of any right or remedies he may otherwise have.

principal use of the premises, the Zoning Official shall request an
interpretation by the Board of Zoning Adjustments.



   (C)   Accessory buildings in residential zones shall not exceed the
lot coverage nor the total square footage of the building to which they are

zone, no part of an accessory building within 25 feet of the common lot line
in the rear shall be nearer a side street lot line than the least depth of
any front yard existing or as required, whichever is less, along such side
street for a principal building on such adjoining lot, and in no case shall
any part of such accessory building be closer to the side street lot line
than the main building to which it is accessory.



   (E)   Only those uses specifically permitted or substantially
similar to permitted uses are permitted in each zone or district, and all
uses specifically prohibited or substantially similar to prohibited uses are
prohibited.



   (F)   No structure shall be erected on any lot or tract of land
which does not adjoin and have direct access to a street or other
right-of-way for at least 20 feet unless otherwise specifically permitted in
this zoning code.



   (G)   The conversion of any building into a dwelling, or the
conversion of any dwelling so as to accommodate an increased number of
dwelling units or families shall be permitted only within a zone in which a
new building for similar occupancy would be permitted under this zoning code,
and only when the resulting occupancy will comply with the requirements
governing new construction in such zone with respect to minimum lot size,
floor area, dimensions of yards and other open spaces, and off-street
parking.  Each conversion shall be subject also to such further requirements
as may be specified hereinafter applying to such zone.  The aforesaid
requirements with respect to yards and other open spaces shall not apply if

exceed twenty-six (26) feet in width; or two (2) access points, not to exceed
twenty-four (24) feet in width each measured at the right-of-way line for

parking space is located.  The Board of Zoning Adjustments may, however,
permit additional access points when such access points are justified and
necessary and provided that the additional access points will not
substantially increase traffic hazards or congestion.  The zoning official
shall apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustments for a decision when permits
are requested in such cases.



            2.   All off-street parking space access points on
a public street shall be located at least ten (10) feet measured at the
right-of-way line from the end of the radius point of intersecting streets
(typical radius 25 feet) but shall not, however, be permitted to be located
on the adjacent or intersecting street right-of-way.  The zoning official
shall apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustments for an original interpretation
whenever there is doubt concerning the radius points of intersecting streets
or in cases where this provision cannot be applied literally.



            3.   All off-street parking space access points on
a public street shall be located at least ten (10) feet apart (measured at
the right-of-way line).



            4.   All off-street parking space points on a
state or federal road or highway shall be approved by the Kentucky Department
of Highways.  In such cases the applicant for a building permit shall
provide the Zoning Official with written approval from the State Department
of Highways prior to the issuance of a building permit.



         (d)   Off-street parking space shall be provided on the
premises at the ratio of three hundred and twenty (320) square feet per
parking space required.  Recommended actual 90o parking space size is 10 ft.
x 20 ft. with 24 ft. aisle between spaces (minimum 9 ft. x 18 ft. with 22 ft.
aisle.)



         (e)   Parking, loading, and unloading space and access
thereto shall be surfaced in a manner adequate to eliminate dust and mud.



         (f)   In all business, multi-family, and professional
office zones where required parking areas are provided for five (5) or more
vehicles or contain more than 1,800 square feet of area or are enlarged or
expanded to provide for five (5) or more vehicles or to contain more than
1,800 square feet of area, they shall be paved with an asphalt, concrete,
brick or other properly bound surface, so as to be durable and dustless. 
Each parking space shall be physically delineated on the surface of the
parking area.  The developer shall have one (1) year from date of parking
lot construction to complete the bound surface.



      (2)   Off-street parking standards.  The following standards

divisions (A)(3) and (5) hereof.



(Section 1, Article 3, C & E, Ord. 794, passed 12-22-83)



         (n)   Bowling alleys.  Five (5) parking spaces for each

within the seating capacity of the establishment, or one (1) for each 100 sq.
ft. of gross floor area, whichever is greater, plus two (2) for each three
(3) employees.



         (s)   Shopping centers.  In the case of mixed uses,
such as shopping centers, the total requirements for off-street parking
facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed
separately.



      (3)   Interpretation of automobile off-street parking space
required.  The Board of Adjustments shall interpret the amount of off-street
parking space required for any building or use, assisted by the off-street
parking standards.  In either case the zoning official shall apply to the
Board of Zoning Adjustments for an original interpretation.



      (4)   Exception to automobile off-street parking space
required on the premises.  If approved by the Board of Adjustments,
off-street parking space required for any building or use may be located off
the premises but within walking distance of 400 feet from the premises it
serves or may be consolidated into a large parking area serving other
buildings and uses.  The zoning official shall apply to the Board of Zoning
Adjustments for a decision when building permits are requested in such
cases.  The Board of Zoning Adjustments shall not authorize the total amount
of parking space required for all buildings and uses to be diminished except
in cases where a consolidated parking area serves buildings or uses which do
not generate automobile parking at the same time such as churches and
stores.  Total parking spaces in such cases may be diminished only to the
maximum required by those buildings and uses which do generate the parking of
automobiles at the same time.  The Board of Zoning Adjustments may require a
plat, deed, and any other proof necessary to show that required parking
space, if located off the premises it serves, is controlled by and available
to the applicant for a building permit.  Such off-street parking space shall
be maintained, required, and regulated as if it were actually located on
premises of the permitted use it is designed to serve.



      (5)   Exception to automobile off-street parking space
required in the B-3 Central Business District.  The Board of Zoning
Adjustments may waive the requirement for automobile off-street parking space
within the B-3 Business District provided the following determinations are
made. The zoning official shall apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustments for
a decision when building permits are requested in such cases.



         (a)   Construction of the required automobile off-street
parking space on the premises would prevent the continuous development of a
compact and coordinated row of commercial buildings fronting on an already
established commercial block or shopping area.



         (b)   The required automobile off-street parking space
cannot be reasonably provided off the premises in accordance with divisions
(A) (3) and (5) hereof.



         (c)   The principal building and use proposed is not
designed or oriented to providing sales or services to persons remaining in
automobiles or similar vehicles.



         (d)   Construction of the required automobile off-street
parking space would detract from the overall shopping desira-bility of the
adjoining buildings and premises and would result in the incompat-ible mixing
of vehicles, buildings, and pedestrian shoppers.



      (6)   Existing nonconforming automobile off-street parking
space.  Existing off-street parking space provided for any building or use
at the time of adoption of this chapter shall not thereafter be reduced
unless it exceeds the requirements of this chapter.  Any existing building
or use not provided with conforming off-street parking space shall be
provided with off-street parking space in conformance with this chapter at
the time of any structural alteration of the building or expansion of the use.



   (B)   Off-street loading and unloading space regulations for
trucks.  All buildings and uses which generate regular trucking traffic
shall be provided with sufficient off-street loading and unloading space on
the premises so that they will generate no loading or unloading activity on
their required parking spaces or on any street.  Space shall also be
provided for the servicing of buildings by refuse collection, fuel, and other
service vehicles.  Off-street loading and unloading spaces and service areas
shall be adequate size and so arranged that they may be used without blockage
or interference with the use of streets, accessways, or automobile parking
facilities.  Loading and unloading space and service areas should be at
least 65 feet in depth, 12 feet in width, with an overhead clearance of not
less than 14 feet. All loading and unloading space and service areas shall be
provided with access to a street or alley as well as appropriate maneuvering
areas.  The Board of Zoning Adjustments shall interpret the amount of
loading and unloading space required for any building or use whenever the
zoning official is unable to apply this provision literally and applies to
the Board of Zoning Adjustments for an original interpretation.



   (C)   Parking, loading and unloading zones.  Minimum required
parking:  In every R-1 and R-2 zone, there shall be provided off-street
parking space for each dwelling as specified in division (A) (2) (a) of this
section; no such space shall be located within any required front yard and
side street side yard area.

   Coordination with subdivision regulations.  In all cases where the
ownership of land is divided for the purpose of general development of lots
of any kind, residential, commercial, industrial, the provisions of Chapter
155 shall apply in addition to the provisions of this chapter.  It is
desirable that access points to manor streets serving all zoning districts be
located no more frequently than once every 1/16 mile to 1/8 mile.
Topographical and traffic volumes shall determine the exact locations, heavy
volume requiring greater spacing.  Along any major street where subdivided
land and its minor streets are not sufficiently developed to permit
acceptably spaced access points, the Planning Commission may approve the
plat-ting of temporary access points which shall be eliminated by the
developer when minor streets or marginal access streets are extended to the
permanent access points.

§ 156.016  FRATERNITY OR SORORITY HOUSES.



   Fraternity or sorority houses, other than those permitted within the
University District, are permitted only in those zoning districts where they
are designated as a conditional use under the zoning district regulations. 
In addition to conforming with all conditional use regulations and all other
provisions of this chapter, fraternity or sorority houses located outside of
the University District shall be subject to the following regulations.



   (A)   At least 15,000 square feet of land area shall be required
before any fraternity or sorority house may be approved as a conditional use.



   (B)   Centralized kitchen facilities may be provided in the
fraternity or sorority house; however, no provision shall be made for kitchen
facilities in any individual student's room or suite. This provision does not
apply to separate kitchen facilities which may be provided in the resident
manager's or supervisor's room or suite.



   (C)   One sign, not over eight square feet in area, identifying the
fraternity or sorority house on the premises shall be permitted.



   (D)   A landscaped separation strip, at least five feet in width,
shall be provided along all adjoining property lines.  The fraternity or
sorority house shall be permanently screened from adjoining ad contiguous
properties by a wall, fence, evergreen hedge, or other approved enclosures,
except in cases where the adjoining and contiguous property is another
fraternity or sorority house.  Such screening shall be located within the
required separation strip and shall have a minimum height of 4-1/2 feet and a
maximum height of seven feet.

or property line, that line is the boundary of the district.



   (C)   Where a zoning-district boundary follows a stream or the shore
of a body of water, that stream or shore line is the boundary of the district.

clear, the Board of Zoning Adjustments shall use these rules to determine the
exact location upon application by the Zoning Official for an original
interpretation.

§ 156.041  GOVERNMENT DISTRICT.



   (A)   Intent.  It is the intent of the Commission to establish a
Government District.  The purpose of this Zone is to identify property owned
by federal, state, county, or municipal governments or by government-owned
public corporations or agencies; also, for the purpose of putting the public
on notice that the areas so zoned are outside the jurisdiction of the
administrators of this zoning code and that development thereon is at the
discretion of the government owning the property.  It is further intended
that this show of public concern may temper the proposals for development in
this district and serve to encourage government conformity to the standard of
this District.



   (B)   Extent.  By definition, this zoning classification applies to
all property owned by governments and government-owned public corporations or
agencies; therefore, this zoning classification shall automatically become
the zoning classification of any property acquired by such government or
government-owned public corporation or agency, concurrently with such
acquisition.



   (C)   Reversion to previous classification.  Upon sale or other
final release of property by a government or government-owned public
corporation or agency, to an individual, partnership, private corporation, or
other non-public organization or association, such property shall revert to
the zoning classification or classifications which applied prior to public
ownership, if in fact it was ever under such other classification or
classifications subsequent to the adoption of this zoning code.  This
provision applies to property acquired by such public bodies after the
adoption of this zoning code and subsequently resold.



   (D)   Reversion to adjoining classification.  Upon sale or other
final release of property by a government or government-owned public
corporation or agency, to an individual, partnership, private corporation, or
other non-public organization or association, such property shall revert to
the most restrictive of the adjoining or nearest zoning classification, if
such property being sold was in fact publicly owned at the time of the
adoption of this zoning code and has not been privately owned at any time
subsequent to such adoption and prior to such sale.



   (E)   Rights of government not conveyable.  The rights of
government which prevent it from being subject to the provisions of this
zoning code are not conveyable to an individual, partnership, private
corporation, or other non-public organization or association, and upon sale
or other final release of public property to an individual or other
non-public body, any construction or development or use of that property
which does not conform to the permitted construction, uses and regulations in
force for the zoning district to which such property reverts, becomes a
non-conforming use subject to the restrictions of this zoning code.



   (F)   Rights of government extend to lessee.  The rights of
government which prevent it from being subject to the provisions of this
zoning code permit it to develop its property at its own discretion, subject
to statutes and regulations based on health and safety, and development of
publicly-owned property in this zoning district by leases, whether public or
private, shall be subject only to the discretion of the government or
government-owned public corporation or agency owning the property and such
statutes and regulations as are based on health and safety.



   (G)   Adult-oriented businesses prohibited.

§ 156.043  FLOODWAY DISTRICT.



   (A)   Intent.  It is intended to establish this district to promote
public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens in flood prone

due to flood conditions in specific areas by designation of the areas as
floodway.



   (B)   Permitted uses.



      (1)   The requirements of this zone are subject to the general

§ 156.044  HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT.



   (A)   Intent.



      (1)   The purpose of the Historic District is to provide a
mechanism for the preservation of sites, structures, and districts of
historical or  architectural significance together with their appurtenances
and environmental settings. The Historic District is meant to enhance, not
substitute for the underlying zoning classification. This article imposes
additional requirements during the construction, alteration, reconstruction,
moving and demolition of sites and structures located within the Historic
District. The Historic District is intended to work in conjunction with the
other zones and for the purpose of protecting and preserving the exterior of
the buildings, structures, appurtenances, and places.



      (2)   The Historic District is to improve the economic
viability of the designated areas within the City of Murray, while enhancing
the visual quality of the environment and the quality of life.



   (B)   Applicability.



      (1)   Upon approval of the Historic District by the City
Council, the official zoning map will be amended.



      (2)   The Historic District classification and regulations
shall be established in addition to the existing zoning classification and
regulations. Where there are conflicts between the procedures and regulations
herein established for the Historic District and other procedures and
regulations of the underlying zone, it is intended that the more stringent
shall apply. The regulations apply to all proposed development within the
boundaries of the Historic District, as shown on the official zoning map.



      (3)   It is the intent of this section that the Architectural
Review Board be lenient in its judgment of plans for new construction or for
alteration, repair, or demolition of structures determined to be
non-contributing, except where such construction, alteration, repair, or
demolition would seriously impair the historic or architectural value of
surrounding structure or the surrounding area. It is not the intent of this
subchapter to limit new construction, alteration, or repair to any one period
of architectural style.



   (C)   Creation and boundaries.



      (1)   The boundaries of the district shall be illustrated in
Exhibit A, attached to Ord. 2009-1480, on file in the City Clerk’s office.



      (2)   An area of land to be designated as a City of Murray
Historic Overlay District generally bounded by Olive Street to the north. Elm
Street to the south, the west right-of-way of the KWT Railroad to the east,
and South 7th Street to the west in Calloway County, Kentucky.



   (D)   Principles and Guidelines.



      (1)   Upon the effective date of this section, no person shall
commence any development activity within the Historic District without
obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness certifying compliance with the
Historic Design Guidelines, (refer to the City of Murray Historic Design
Guidelines).



      (2)   The Historic Design Guidelines are not intended to
discourage development or to dictate architectural design or style, but to
encourage such development that contributes to the overall urban design
quality of the district. These guidelines shall be the basis for evaluating
applications for development proposals.



   (E)   Administration.



      (1)   Responsibility for administering and implementing the
Historic Design Guidelines is delegated to the Architectural Review Board,
City Planning Staff and Murray Main Street, a nonprofit corporation pursuant
to KRS Chapter 58.



      (2)   Each proposed development within the Historic District
shall apply for a Certificate of Appropriateness. The application guidelines
will be followed as described in the Architectural Review Board ordinance,
§§ 32.65 through 32.69.

SPECIAL REGULATIONS



§ 156.050  SIGNS.



   (A)   General.



      (1)   Intent.  It is the intent of this section to regulate
signs.  A permit for the installation of any sign is required unless
otherwise provided for in this section.  Permits must be obtained from the
Zoning Official before installation of any type of sign.  Failure to obtain
a permit can result in the Zoning Official having the sign removed at the
owner’s expense.  If the owner fails to pay for such removal, the city may
attach a lien to the lot on which the sign is located.



      (2)   Purpose. Signs perform an important function in
identifying and promoting properties, businesses, services, residences,
events, and other matters of interest to the public. This section regulates
all signs within the city to ensure that they are appropriate for their
respective uses, in keeping with the appearance of the affected property and
surrounding environment, and protective of the public health, safety, and
general welfare. The sign regulations of this section are intended to balance
the following differing, and at times, competing goals:



         (a)   To support the desired character of the city, as
expressed in adopted plans, policies, and regulations;



         (b)   To promote an attractive visual environment;



         (c)   To encourage the effective use of signs as a means
of communication for businesses, organizations, and individuals;



         (d)   To provide a means of way-finding for visitors and
residents;



         (e)   To provide for reasonable business identification,
advertising, and communication;



         (f)   To prohibit signs of such excessive size and
number that they obscure one another to the detriment of the economic and
social well-being of the city and its residents, property owners, and
visitors;



         (g)   To protect the safety and welfare of the public by
minimizing hazards for motorized and non-motorized traffic;



         (h)   To minimize the possible adverse effects of signs
on nearby public and private property;



         (i)   To provide broadly for the expression of
individual opinions through the use of signs on private property; and



         (j)   To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed
right of free expression is protected.



      (3)   Scope and applicability. All signs within the city are
subject to the regulations of this section and all other applicable
provisions of this chapter.



      (4)   Content neutrality. Any sign permitted under this code
shall allow the communication of information for commercial and
non-commercial purposes without regulating the content, as long as the sign
complies with all size, height, and location, as well as other applicable
requirements of this code, and does not bear or contain statements, words, or
pictures of obscene or pornographic subjects.



      (5)   General rules for reading and applying the language of
this section. Regulations are no more strict than stated. It will be up to
the Zoning Official and/or designee to comprehend the code and apply it. The
action of the Code Enforcement Officer is final unless appealed as provided
in division (L)(2).



      (6)   Hierarchy of regulations. Where there is a conflict
between a land use regulation and a structural regulation, or other conflicts
not otherwise addressed by this chapter, the most restrictive applies.



      (7)   Severability. If any word, sentence, section, chapter,
or any other provision or portion of this code or rules adopted hereunder is
invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining words,
sentences, sections, chapters, provisions, or portions will not be affected
and will continue in full force and effect.



   (B)   Permit requirements, procedures, and fees.



      (1)   Permit required. Unless a particular sign is exempt from
the permit requirement under an explicit provision of this section or other
applicable law, then a permit for such sign is required.



      (2)   Replacements. If any sign is removed and any new sign is
erected in its place, a permit shall be obtained the same as if a new sign
were erected at a new location, subject to all requirements enumerated herein.



      (3)   Maintenance. If any sign is removed for maintenance and
replaced on the same supports, a new permit will not be deemed necessary if
the size or type of sign is not changed.



      (4)   Relocation of signs. If any sign is removed from one
location and erected at a new location, a new permit shall be obtained.



      (5)   Alteration. Alteration or enlargement of any sign shall
require a permit the same as for a new sign.



      (6)   Application. No permit shall be granted until and after
an application has been filed with the designated Zoning Official, showing
the plans and specifications, including dimensions, materials, and details of
construction of the proposed structure and meeting all provisions of this
section.



      (7)   Application form. The Zoning Official shall prepare and
provide a form to be used as an application for a sign permit. The same form
may constitute a permit, when duly approved. Multiple signs may be listed on
a single permit only when they are all on the same lot or parcel.



      (8)   Information on application. The sign application form
may call for disclosure of any of the following information, but not limited
to:



         (a)   Name and contact information for the applicant,
and if separate, the name, address, and consent of the property owner;



         (b)   Street address;



         (c)   A site plan and/or building elevations showing the
location of the proposed sign(s) on the lot and/or building, including
setbacks; and



         (d)   Detailed sign information including type of
construction, method of illumination, dimensions, copy, method of mounting
and/or erecting, and other similar information. The content of the message or
speech displayed on the sign shall not be considered when approving or
denying a sign permit; however, the content must be submitted to evaluate the
sign copy area. See division (A)(4) for more information.



      (9)   Incompleteness. Initial review of an application will be
for the purpose of determining if the application is complete. If the
application is found incomplete, written notice thereof will be given within
seven (7) business days of submission, detailing the points of
incompleteness, provided contact information has been provided. Notice is
deemed effective when mailed, emailed, or personally delivered. After notice
of incompleteness, the applicant shall have ten (10) business days in which
to resubmit the application, with all noticed items of incompleteness
corrected. Upon timely re-submission, a new application fee is not required.



      (10)   Time for decision. The Zoning Official shall render a
decision on each complete sign permit application within ten (10) business
days of when the application was complete.



      (11)   Noncompliance with permit. All signs must conform to
the requirements of that permit and all other applicable laws. Any sign not
erected or constructed as represented on the application upon which the
permit was issued shall not be construed as a hardship case, but shall be
construed as a misrepresentation of facts on the application and a violation
of this section. The owner or agent shall be given a two (2) week notice to
remove the sign or correct the error. Any noncomplying sign which is not
removed or corrected within the required time shall be deemed a public
nuisance and a violation of the zoning regulations, and may be abated in the
same manner as any public nuisance or zoning regulation violation.



      (12)   Fees. Upon enactment of this section, future changes of
fee schedules will be reviewed and set by the City Financial Committee and
City Council. The current fee schedule is as follows:



         (a)   Freestanding or monument style sign: $50;



         (b)   Wall signage: $50;

   (K)   Rules of measurement.



      (1)   Sign area. The area of a sign enclosed in a frame or
cabinet whether freestanding, monument, or wall sign is determined based on
the outer dimensions of the continuous perimeter surrounding the sign face.



         Area = H x W



            or



         Area = 3.14 x radius2







 



      (2)   Channel (individual) letter signs. The area of a sign
comprised of individual letters or elements attached to a building wall or
window is determined by calculating the area of the smallest geometric figure
that can be drawn around the letters and/or elements. Signs consisting of
individual letters and/or elements will be measured as one sign. Below is an
example of such measuring rules.







 



      (3)   Multi-sided signs. When the sign faces of a multi- sided
sign are parallel or within ten (10) degrees or twenty-four (24) inches of
parallel, only one (1) side is counted for total sign area. If the sign faces
are not parallel or within ten (10) degrees or 24 inches of parallel, all
sign faces are counted for total sign area.







 



      (4 )    Sign height . The height of a sign shall be computed
as the distance from bottom of the base of the sign at normal grade to the
top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be
construed to be the average grade level of lot frontage after construction.







 







 



      (5 )    Illumination and luminance. Sign illumination in
foot-candles is measured two (2) feet from the sign face. For the purpose of
verifying compliance with maximum brightness level limits expressed in nits,
brightness levels must be measured with the dynamic display set to run full
white copy with a luminance meter positioned at a location perpendicular to
the sign face center. When taking the luminance reading, the sign face must
be the only subject visible in the viewfinder.



      (6)   Window area. The area of a window includes only the
glass or glazed elements of the window. Frames, mullions, and similar
features are not counted as part of the window area.







   (L)   Violations and appeals.



      (1)   Violations.



         (a)   This section shall be enforced under the
provisions of Chapter 40. Any person who so violates this section or fails to
comply with any of its requirements including the compliance with any
official notice of violation, shall be subject to a fine as detailed in §

§ 156.051  MANUFACTURED/MOBILE HOME REGULATIONS.



   (A)   Intent.  The intent of this section of the zoning code is to
provide for the use of mobile homes and mobile home parks within the city. 
It is intended to provide a blend between dwellings and mobile homes such
that neither will create a nuisance to the other.  Because of their unusual
characteristics, mobile homes pose special problems in the application of
land use control techniques and require special consideration as to their
proper location and character in relation to adjacent uses and to the
development of the community, and use to the circumstances and conditions
under which each use may be permitted. The standards contained in this
provision represent an attempt to provide adequate protection for, and
consideration of, consideration of, both the community and the mobile home
dweller.



   (B)   The following regulations are provided for the purposes
outlined above.



      1.   Mobile home parks.  Mobile home parks may be permitted
only in those zoning districts where they are designated as a conditional use
under the zoning district regulations.  A mobile home park shall be defined
as used in KRS 219.320(5) "mobile home parks."  All mobile home parks shall
conform with all provisions of KRS 219.310 to 219.410 and shall conform with
all applicable provisions of this zoning code.



Editor’s Note:



   See KRS 219.320 for current definitions  concerning mobile homes. 
The term  “mobile home park” is not specifically     defined therein.



         (a)   Plat.  A plat shall be submitted to the zoning
official along with the conditional use permit application.  The plat shall
conform with the Department for Human Resources, Bureau for Health Services
(902 KAR 15.010 - effective date 2/5/75).



         (b)   Uses.  The premises of a mobile home park shall
be used for mobile homes and those accessory buildings and uses specifically
designated in the approved conditional use permit only.



         (c)   Compatibility.  The tract of land must be
suitable for a mobile home park by virtue of its location, shape, topography,
and the nature of surrounding development.



         (d)   Screening.  A landscaped separation strip at
least five feet in width shall be provided along all property lines and
public streets on which the project is located.  The Board of Zoning
Adjustments may also require that the mobile home park be permanently
screened from adjoining and contiguous properties by a wall, fence, evergreen
ridge, and/or other approved enclosures.  Such screening, if required, shall
conform to the screening section of this chapter and be located within the
required separation strip.



         (e)   Construction permit required.  The zoning
official shall not issue a building permit for an approved mobile home park
until the applicant presents a valid construction permit from the State
Department of Health as required by  KRS 219.350, and has agreed in writing
to the conditions imposed by the Board of Zoning Adjustments.



         (f)   Operators permit required.  The zoning official
shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for an approved mobile home park
until the applicant presents a valid operators permit from the State
Department of Health as required by KRS 219.330, and has fulfilled all
conditions imposed by the Board of Zoning Adjustments.



         (g)   Existing mobile home parks.  All existing mobile
home parks legally operating within the corporate limits of the city at the
time of the passage of this chapter may continue to operate as existing
nonconforming structures and uses, but shall be required to maintain a valid
operating permit as required under KRS 219.340, and shall not expand or
intensify their use without bringing such mobile home into compliance with
this Chapter.

§ 156.052  SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING.



   (A)   Intent.  The intent of this chapter is to require buffering
between noncompatible land uses; to protect, preserve, and promote the
aesthetic appeal, character, and value of the surrounding neighborhood; to
promote public health and safety through the reduction of noise, air
pollution, unsightly areas, and artificial light glare.



   (B)   Definitions.



      (1)   "LANDSCAPING."  Landscaping is considered to be the
planting and maintenance of a lawn, in addition to some combination of
evergreen, shrubs, hedges, vines, or flowers.  The combination may include
natural features such as rock and stone and structural features including,
but not limited to, fountains, walls, fences, and benches.



      (2)   "FENCE".  A structure consisting of rails, pickets,
woven wire, hedges, or the like.



      (3)   "OPACITY."  Opacity is the concealment of office,
institutional, business, and industrial development from the view of adjacent
residential or agricultural properties.



      (4)   "SCREENING."  Screening is defined as decorative fences
or walls, evergreen vegetation, or landscaped areas, which are set forth for
the purpose of concealing the view of office, institutional, business, and
industrial properties from adjacent residential or agricultural properties.



      (5)   "WALL".  A structure consisting of stone, brick or the
like.



   (C)   Sites affected by this chapter.



      (1)   New sites.  No new site development, building
structure, or vehicular use area shall hereafter be created and used unless
landscaping is provided as required by the provisions of this chapter.



      (2)   Existing sites.  No property lines shall be altered,
nor shall any building, structure, or vehicular use area be expanded, unless
the minimum landscaping required by the provisions of this chapter is
provided for the property to the extent of its alteration or expansions, and
not the entire property.



   (D)   Screening.  For office, institutional, business, and
industrial development when established on property adjacent to any
residential, agricultural, or government zoning districts, the following
shall apply.



      (1)   Screening shall be provided along all side and rear lot
lines adjacent to a residential zone to extend to within ten feet of each
street right-of-way line.  However, screening may be omitted for office and
institutional uses along any lot line or portion thereof, whenever a property
is developed with a 25-foot landscaped yard adjacent to such lot line or
portion thereof.  Screening along a side or rear lot line can be extended to
the street right-of-way line at a height of three feet where deemed essential
for the intent of this chapter.



      (2)   Whenever a front or side yard is across the street from
any property located in a residential zone, there shall be provided adjacent
thereto landscaped yard ten feet in depth for a distance equal to the
residential zoning lot line along the street.



      (3)   Whenever properties are developed adjacent to an alley,
screening is also required, but may also be omitted at driveways deemed
essential for ingress and egress at uses established on the property.



      (4)   Landscaped yards required by this section shall not be
used for driveways, parking, loading, outdoor storage, displays, work areas,
sights, or similar uses.



      (5)   Screening shall be provided on all new, altered or
expanded development sufficiently to hide from ground level view, all loading
docks, trash receptacles, outdoor storage, outdoor work areas, or similar
uses from any residential zoning district located within 150 feet of such
uses.



      (6)   Screening shall be provided at a height and density to
achieve the opacity required.  Where evergreens are used, the following
shall be required:  trees shall be a minimum of five feet in height, with a
minimum caliper of 1-1/2 inches immediately after planting.  Shrubs and
hedges shall be at least three feet in height when planted, and shall conform
to the opacity requirements within three years after planting.  In most
cases to achieve the opacity required, this shall constitute a solid hedge or
shrubbery wall six feet in height.



      (7)   When fencing is used for screening, it shall not be less
than five feet nor more than eight feet in height.  Acceptable fencing for
screening includes solid walls constructed of masonry, architectural tile,
stone, wood, or other similar materials (excluding chain link fences).  The
solid wall should be reduced to three feet in height when adjacent to a
public street, and shall not be placed closer to the street than the
right-of-way line.  On corner lots, the solid wall shall not be placed any
closer to the street on the side yard than the required building set back
line.



      (8)   All types of screening shall be kept in a neat, clean,
and healthful condition.  The owner of the property shall be responsible for
this maintenance.  Where landscaping is used, this shall include property
pruning, mowing of lawns, weeding, removal of litter, fertilizing, and the
replacement of plants when necessary.



      (9)   When any type of screening is used, the property owner
shall prepare a landscape plan for submission to the planner's office.  The
Zoning Official shall follow the requirements of this chapter in approving or
disapproving any landscape plan.  If the property owner disagrees with the
ruling of the Zoning Official, he or she may appeal to the Board of Zoning
Adjustments for a ruling.



      (10)   All screened areas will be subject to review
annually.  If deficiencies are found, the property owner will be notified by
letter and the deficiencies shall be corrected within three months.



   (E)   Fences and walls.



      (1)   Fences and walls located in any residential district
shall be subject to the following height and location restrictions unless a
variance is granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustments:



         (a)   Fences or walls shall meet the following height
limitations:




   Front Yard   4 feet





   Rear and side yards   8 feet




      (2)   No fence or wall shall be located closer than ten (10)
feet to any street right-of-way.



      (3)   On corner lots, the side facing the secondary street
shall be treated as a front yard.



      (4)   Barbed wire or electric fences shall not be permitted in
any residential zone or adjacent to any residential zone.



      (5)   No fence or wall that obstructs sight along any public

§ 156.053  NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND PREMISES.



   (A)   Intent.  Within the zones and districts established by this
zoning code, or amendments thereto, there exist lots, structures, uses of
land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this
zoning code was adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated,
or restricted under the terms of this zoning code or future amendment.  It
is the intent of this zoning code to permit these nonconformities to continue
until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.  It is further
the intent of this zoning code that nonconformities shall not be enlarged or
extended beyond the scope and area of their operation at the time of the
adoption or amendment of this zoning code, nor be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone or if all or
part of.



   (B)   Nonconforming lots of record.



      (1)   In any zone or district in which single-family,
two-family, or multi-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family,
two-family, or multi-family dwelling as appropriately permitted in the zone
and customary accessory buildings may be erected the date of adoption or
amendment of this zoning code, or amendment notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership.  This provision shall apply
even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or frontage, or
both, that are generally applicable in the zone or district, providing that
dimensional requirements other than those applying to area or frontage or
both, of the lots shall conform to the regulations for the zone or district
in which such lot is located.  Dimensional variances must be obtained
through action of the Board of Zoning Adjustments as provided by this chapter.



      (2)   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions
of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the
date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code, and if all or part of the
lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the
land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes
of this zoning code.  No subdivision of such parcel shall be made which
creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this zoning
code.



   (C)   Nonconforming uses of land. Where at the date of adoption or
amendment of this zoning code lawful use of land exists which would not be
permitted by the regulations imposed by this zoning code, the use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:



         (l)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the date of
adoption or amendment of this zoning code.



      (2)   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part
to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at
the date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code. The use may be moved
to another position on the lot or parcel through appeal to the Board of
Zoning Adjustments in § 156.083.



      (3)   When a nonconforming use of land is discontinued or
abandoned so as to show a gross lack of diligence in using for one year or
more (except when governmental action prevents such use), the land shall not
thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the zone or
district in which it is located.



   (D)   Nonconforming structures.  Where a lawful structure exists at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be
built under the terms of this zoning code by reason of restrictions on area,
lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements
concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.



      (1)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or
altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or
portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.



      (2)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming
portion of a structure be damaged, destroyed, or demolished by any means, it
may be reconstructed or repaired but not to exceed the number of cubic feet
existing in it, and not to extend or enlarge the scope and area of its
operation prior to its damage, destruction, or demolition except as otherwise
provided in division (E)(5) below.



      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
zone or district in which it is located after it is moved. However, said
structure may be moved to another part of the same lot by appeal to the Board
of Zoning Adjustments as provided in § 156.083.



   (E)   Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises
in combination. If lawful use involving individual structures or of structure
and premises in combination exists at the date of adoption or amendment of
this zoning code that would not be allowed in the zone or district under the
terms of this zoning code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.



      (1)   No existing structures devoted to a use not permitted by
this zoning code in the zone or district in which it is located shall be
enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally
altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the
zone or district in which it is located except as provided in division (5)
below.



      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any
part of a building which was arranged or designed for such use at the date of
adoption or amendment of this zoning code, but no such use shall be extended
to occupy any land outside such building.



      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming
use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another
nonconforming use by appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustments if the
proposed use is in the same or a more restrictive classification.  In
permitting such change, the Board of Zoning Adjustments may require
appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this
zoning code.



      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in
or on which a  nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone or district, and  the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.



      (5)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure
and premises in combination, is halted because of the damage, destruction, or
demolition of the structure by any means, the structure may be reconstructed
or repaired but not to exceed the number of cubic feet existing in it prior
to its damage, destruction, or demolition, and the nonconforming use resumed
but not to extend or enlarge the scope and area of its operation prior to its
damage, destruction, or demolition.



      (6)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure
and premises in combination, intentionally discontinued or abandoned so as to
show a gross lack of diligence in using for one year or more (except when
government action prevents such use), the structure, or structure and
premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity
with the regulations of the zone or district in which it is located.



   (F)   Repairs and maintenance.  On any nonconforming structure or
portion of structure, and on any structure containing a nonconforming use,
work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing or other parts, provided that the cubic content
of the nonconforming structure or portion shall not be increased.  Nothing
in this zoning code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening, repairing,
or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof.



   (G)   Conditional uses not nonconforming uses.  Any existing
principal permitted use at the date of the adoption or amendment of this
zoning code which would thereafter require a conditional use permit shall
without further action be deemed a conforming use, but any enlargement or
replacement of such use, in buildings or on land, shall require a conditional
use permit.

§ 156.999



§ 156.054  PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT REGULATIONS.



   (A)   Planned development projects are conditional uses in the
following zoning districts:  R-3 - Residential PDP's only: R-3A, R-4, R-5,
B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, professional office, industrial - PDP's other than for
residential uses.



   (B)   Planned development projects are prohibited in the following
zoning districts: R-1, R-2, agricultural, floodway.



   (C)   Intent.  It is the intent of the Planning Commission to allow
some flexibility in this chapter.  This is done in recognition that times
have changed and are changing.  A planned development project is unique and
is not intended for every development. However an innovative project may be
allowed through this provision. It is intended that a condominium project or
an office park or any combination of such be considered.



   (D)   Procedure.  The planned development project process is
designed for projects that are complex or innovative and perhaps different
from normal development within the area. All planned development projects
shall be subject to the following regulations:



      (1)   Determination whether project subject to process.  The
Zoning Official will determine if a project should follow the planned
development project process.



      (2)   Advisory meeting with Planning Commission.  The
developer of a proposed planned development project shall meet with the
Planning Commission prior to the preparation or submission of a plat. The
purpose of this meeting shall be to discuss informally with the Planning
Commission the minimum requirements and design standards for planned
development projects as well as to discuss existing or proposed development
which may affect or be affected by, the proposed project. For the purpose of
such discussion the developer shall provide a sketch plan indicating the
proposed project area, its relationship to the surrounding area and the
general development scheme to be presented in the preliminary plat
application. Formal application or filing of a plat with the Planning
Commission is not required for the advisory meeting.



      (3)   Board of Zoning Adjustments to determine
compatibility.  After the advisory meeting with the Planning Commission the
Board of Zoning Adjustments will meet to determine if a project is compatible
in its proposed location. A planned development project application and a
plat shall be filed with the Zoning Official prior to the Board of Zoning
Adjustments' meeting. If the Board of Zoning Adjustments finds the project to
be compatible with the surrounding area, a planned development project
application and a plat shall be filed with the zoning official. A public
hearing will be held by the Planning Commission within 60 days.



      (4)   Notice of hearing.  Notice of the public hearing shall
be given as follows:



         (a)   Notice of the time, place and reason for holding a
public hearing shall be given by one publication in the newspaper of general
circulation in Calloway County, Kentucky, not earlier than 21 days nor later
than seven days before the public hearing.



         (b)   Notice of the hearing shall be given at least 14
days in advance of the hearing by first class mail to the owners of all
property adjoining the property where the project is proposed. This includes
those properties across public rights-of-ways. If the property is jointly
owned all property owners must be listed. It shall be the duty of the project
applicant to furnish the names and addresses of the owners of all adjoining
properties.



         (c)   Notice of the hearing shall be posted
conspicuously on the property for 14 consecutive days immediately prior to
the hearing. The sign shall state "planned development project site" in
letters three inches in height. The time, place and date of hearing shall be
in letters at least one inch in height. The sign shall be constructed of
durable material and shall state the telephone number of the appropriate
zoning commission.



      (5)   Public hearing before the Planning Commission.  The
Planning Commission will conduct the public hearing as follows:



         (a)   The Chairperson of the Planning Commission shall
preside at the hearing and shall be responsible for its conduct.



         (b)   The applicant or opponent may represent himself,
may be represented by counsel, or may be represented by another person or
persons. Both the applicant and the opponent may present witnesses to
testify. Both the applicant and opponent shall have the right to
cross-examine any witnesses who testify against them.



         (c)   The order of the hearing shall be as follows:



            1.   Opening statement by applicant.



            2.   Opening statement by opponent.



            3.   Presentation of evidence and testimony by
applicant.



            4.   Presentation of evidence and testimony by
opponent.



            5.   Rebuttal of evidence and testimony by
applicant.



            6.   Rebuttal of evidence and testimony by
opponent.



            7.   Closing statement by applicant.



            8.   Closing statement by opponent.



         (d)   No formal rules of evidence shall be required. The
hearing itself shall be as informal as possible consistent with an orderly
determination in a fair and impartial manner of the issues before the
Commission.



         (e)   The hearing shall be electronically recorded. If a
transcript is requested by either the applicant or opponent the expense shall
be accrued to said party requesting the transcript. If the Planning
Commission gives preliminary approval to the proposed project, the Commission
must recommend to the Board of Zoning Adjustments that the project be
considered for a conditional use permit.



      (6)   Conditional use process.  An application for a
conditional use permit must be filed with the Zoning Official prior to the
meeting of the Board of Zoning Adjustments. The conditional use application
process for a planned development project will be the same as for any other
conditional use once the Planning Commission has given preliminary approval,
except that a conditional use permit for any planned development project will
not be valid until the Planning Commission has reviewed and approved the
final plat of the project and certified such on the final plat.



      (7)   Planning Commission final approval.  Upon receiving
written authorization by the Board of Zoning Adjustments of its approval for
a conditional use permit, the applicant shall submit the plat of the proposed
planned development project to the Planning Commission for its review and
final approval within six months from the date of such written approval. If
the Planning Commission finds that the plat is substantially in accord with
preliminary approval and fulfills the attached special conditions, the
Planning Commission may approve the project and the Chairperson of the
Planning Commission shall indicate such approval on the final plat. The
planned development project shall thereafter be subject to all of the
provisions of this chapter regarding conditional use permits including
recording, effect, noncompliance, time limit and permanently satisfied
permits.



   (E)   Dimension and area regulations.  Dimension and area
regulations and lot sizes may vary from that allowed in the applicable zoning
district but are intended to be consistent and compatible with existing
development. The overall density shall be consistent with the applicable
zoning district.



   (F)   Signs.  Signs are allowed as provided by the Planning
Commission, and only as specified on the approved development plan.



   (G)   Other requirements.



      (1)   All PDP's must be filed as approved by the Planning
Commission and Board of Zoning Adjustments with the Calloway County Clerk's
office and the Murray Planning Commission. No changes will be permitted
unless prior approval is received by the Board of Zoning Adjustments and
these must be consistent with the Planning Commission's intent and direction.
All changes will also be recorded with the Clerk and the Planning Commission
and will originate with the Zoning Official.



      (2)   The plat submitted to the Board of Zoning Adjustments
and Planning Commission shall have the following information contained and
data, and shall be drawn to an appropriate scale as to the size and nature of
the project as approved by the Planning Department.



         (a)   Buildings.



         (b)   Parking areas with arrangement and number of
parking spaces.



         (c)   Entrance and exit roads and their relationship to
existing and proposed streets, alleys and other public ways.



         (d)   Setback lines, permanent open spaces, separation
strips and landscaped areas.



         (e)   Date, title, name and location of the PDP, graphic
scale, and true north line.



         (f)   All dimensions, angles, bearings and similar data
on date on the plat shall be tied to the primary control points, location and
description of such control points shall be given.



         (g)   Project boundary lines, buildings, parking areas,
setback lines, permanent open spaces, separation strips, landscaped areas,
easements, access roads and street right-of-way lines with accurate
dimensions to the nearest .01 of a foot; bearings or deflection angles,
radii, arcs, and central angles of all curves with dimensions to the nearest
minute.



         (h)   Designation of all buildings, parking areas,
permanent open spaces, separation strips, landscaped areas, easements, access
roads, street rights-of-way and other areas by name, use, purpose or other
appropriate method as well as by width, length, land area or floor area
devoted to such use or purpose.



         (i)   Location and description of monuments.



         (j)   Name and locations of adjoining subdivisions,
streets or other property.



         (k)   Certification, on plat, of title showing that the
applicant is the owner and a statement by such owner dedicating streets,
rights-of-way and any other sites for public use, if any.



         (l)   Certification, on plat, by surveyor or engineer as
to the accuracy of survey and plat.



         (m)   All special conditions attached to preliminary
approval or any restrictions specified by the owner shall be placed directly
on the final plat or attached thereto in form for recording.



         (n)   Certification attached to plat stating that the
owner has complied with the following:



            1.   A surety bond or certified check has been
posted with the city in sufficient amount to assure completion of all such
required improvements within two years.



         (o)   Certification on plat by the Chairperson of the
Planning Commission and Board of Zoning Adjustments that the plat has been
approved for recording in the office of the County Clerk.



      (3)   The requirement for all planned-development project
shall be as follows:



         (a)   Construction of all PDP's shall be initiated
within one year after approval of the final plat.



         (b)   The owner of a PDP shall provide and permanently
maintain the areas required for landscaping purposes. The landscaping is
subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission before preliminary
or final approval.



         (c)   The applicant of a PDP may be required to provide
a detailed statement of proposal, including covenants, agreements, or other
specific documents, showing the ownership and method of assuring perpetual
maintenance to be applied to those areas within the project that are to be
used for open space, recreational or other common or quasi public purposes.
Such a statement, if required, shall be attached to the preliminary and final
plats as special conditions.



         (d)   The applicant of a PDP may



be required to provide a statement of financial responsibility including the
posting of a surety bond or certified check payable to the city to assure the
installation of improvements required as special conditions. The bond or
check shall be subject to the condition that the improvements will be
completed within two years after approval of the final plat.



         (e)   In addition to the Board of Zoning Adjustments'
fees for two meetings and the zoning fee, the Planning Commission shall set a
plat review fee of $50 per final plat reviewed by the Planning Commission.



         (f)   An application for a PDP may include a proposed
subdivision of the tract of land within the project property lines into one
or more separately owned and operated units. Such proposed subdivision, if
approved with the proposed PDP and if in compliance with the city subdivision
regulations, shall be permissible without further subdivision regulation
approval. Any PDP which includes a proposed subdivision of the total tract of
land within the property lines into one or more separately owned and operated
units shall, if approved, be subject to all attached special conditions and
all provisions of this chapter regarding conditional use permits in its
entirety including all approved subdivisions regardless of their ownership.



         (g)   There shall be no subdivision of an approved PDP
unless such subdivision is in conformance with the originally approved and
recorded final plat or an amended final plat of the PDP has been approved and
recorded in conformance with this chapter recording the procedure for review
and approval of all PDP's.



         (h)   There shall be no change, alteration, amendment or
extension of any approved PDP final plat unless such change, alteration,
amendment or extension is approved in conformance with this chapter.



         (i)   Construction of all PDP's shall be completed
within two years after approval of the final plat.  The Planning Commission
may, however, require as a special condition the completion of the project at
an earlier date or may grant an extension of completion time when such
extension is deemed reasonable and necessary by the Planning Commission.



   (H)   General standards.  In any PDP, although it is permissible to
depart from the conformance with the principal building and single-lot
dimension and area regulations contained in this chapter, there shall be no
diminution of the regulations and standards set forth in this chapter for
PDP's.



      (1)   The Planning Commission shall examine the proposed PDP
with particular attention to the following:



         (a)   The influence the proposed project may be expected
to have on existing or future development in surrounding areas and the
achievement of a desirable spatial relationship between the buildings and the
land, and between the buildings themselves.



         (b)   To insure that the roads, thoroughfares, streets,
and accompanying access points proposed are suitable and adequate to carry
anticipated traffic and that increased land use intensity will not generate
traffic in such amounts as to overload the existing or proposed street
network.



         (c)   To insure that existing or proposed utility
services are adequate for the population densities or land use intensities
proposed.



      (2)   Off-street parking space shall be provided on the site
as prescribed in § 156.014, General Regulations for Vehicles.  All parking
space and access thereto shall be paved in a manner approved by the Planning
Commission.



      (3)   Areas shall be provided for the loading and unloading of
delivery trucks and other vehicles and for the servicing of buildings by
refuse collection, fuel and other service vehicles, in addition to the
required automobile parking spaces.  Such areas shall be adequate in size
and so arranged that they may be used without blockage or interference with
the use of accessways or automobile parking facilities.



      (4)   No PDP shall be permitted vehicular access to a minor
residential street unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission.



      (5)   Lighting facilities shall be arranged in such a manner
so as to prevent direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind to
adjoining street or properties.



      (6)   All PDP building construction shall conform to all
local, state and federal regulations pertaining to the particular type of
building or buildings proposed.  The Planning Commission may also require as
a special condition that any building construction in a PDP be of an approved
fire resistant material or that before the certificate of occupancy for any
building within the project is approved, the developer must provide the
enforcement officer written certificates of approval from the State Fire
Marshal or State Health Department.



      (7)   The Planning commission shall attach any reasonable
special conditions necessary to insure that there be no departure from the
intent of this zoning code.



      (8)   Because a PDP is inherently more complex than single lot
development and because each such project must be tailored to the topography
and neighboring uses, the standards and special conditions for such projects
cannot be inflexible.



      (9)   Adult-oriented businesses are prohibited as a planned
development project.

      (4)   If a person holding a home occupation permit moves to a
new location, the existing permit shall be automatically terminated.  The
individual shall notify the zoning official of any move from the permit
location or termination of the home occupation.

vehicular or pedestrian traffic to the residence unless approved by the Board
of Zoning Adjustments.



      (9)   External storage or display of materials, goods,
supplies, or equipment related to the operation of a home occupation is
prohibited.



      (10)   Home occupations shall comply with all local, state or
federal laws or regulations pertinent to the activity pursued, and the
requirements of or permission granted by this section shall not be construed
as an exemption from such regulations.



      (11)   Only one unlighted sign not over two (2) square feet in
area identifying home occupations shall be permitted on the dwelling
premises. Persons with demonstrated physical disabilities may be permitted
special consideration by the Board of Zoning Adjustments.  The applicant may
request waiver of a portion or all of one or more of the foregoing
requirements. This special request shall be considered at a Board of Zoning
Adjustments meeting, after notification to adjacent property owners.  The
Board of Zoning Adjustments may only grant waivers on the basis of
applicant's physical inability to function within said requirements.



   (E)   The following shall be prohibited as home occupations:

§ 156.056  ADULT-ORIENTED BUSINESSES.



   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of the section is to regulate adult
oriented businesses through the application of uniform zoning, locational and
distance requirements to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the city and establish reasonable and uniform
regulations for the operation of adult oriented businesses with the goal of
reducing or eliminating the adverse secondary effects associated with adult
oriented businesses.  It is not the intent of this section to limit or
restrict the content of communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials.  Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this section to
restrict or deny access by adults to materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.

that one publication occurs not less than seven calendar days nor more than
21 calendar days before the occurrence of such hearing.



         (c)   Notice of the hearing shall be posted on the site
at least 14 days in advance of the hearing. The notice shall consist of a
written notice, of durable material at least two feet by four feet in size,
stating that “[Name of applicant]”proposes to construct a
telecommunications tower on this site” and including the addresses and
telephone numbers of the applicant and the Planning Commission. Notice of the
proposal shall also be posted on the property nearest to the public road.
This notice shall consist of a written notice, of durable material at least
two feet by four feet in size, stating that “[Name of applicant] proposes
to construct a telecommunications tower near this site” and including the

proposed construction, the telephone number and address of the Planning
Commission and shall inform the addressee of his or her right to participate
in the Planning Commissioner's proceedings on the application. Records
maintained by the Property Valuation Administrator may be relied upon
conclusively to determine the identity and address of said owner. In the
event a property is in condominium of cooperative forms of ownership, then
the person notified by mail shall be the president or chairperson of the
owner group that administers property commonly owned by the condominium or
cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two or more co-owners of
an adjoining property who are listed in the property valuation

         (e)   Upon holding the hearing, the Planning Commission
shall, within 60 days commencing from the date that the application is
received by the Planning Commission, or within a date specified in a written
agreement between the Planning commission and the applicant, make its final
decision to approve or disapprove the uniform application. If the Planning
Commission fails to issue a final decision within 60 days, and if there is no
written agreement between the Planning Commission and the utility to a
specific date of the Planning commission to issue a decision, it shall be
presumed that the Planning Commission has approved the utility's uniform
application.



         (f)   If the Planning Commission disapproves of the
proposed construction, it shall state the reasons for disapproval in its
written decision and may make suggestions which, in it opinion, better
accomplish the objectives of the comprehensive plan and the locally adopted
zoning regulations. No permit for construction of a cellular or personal
communications' services antenna tower shall be issued until the Planning
Commission approves the uniform application or the 60-day time period has
expired, which ever occurs first.



         (g)   Upon approval of an application for the
construction of a cellular antenna tower by a Planning Commission, the
applicant shall notify the Public Service Commission within ten working days
of the approval. The notice to the Public Service Commission shall include a
map showing the location of the construction site. If an applicant fails to
file notice of an approved uniform application with the Public Service
Commission, the applicant shall be prohibited from beginning construction on
the cellular antenna tower until such notice has been made.



   (E)   Design standards. The applicant shall provide information
demonstrating compliance with the requirements contained herein. Potential
sites that should be considered (in order from most-preferred to
least-preferred) include existing utility towers, industrial zones,
commercial zones, and government buildings and properties. Where the Planning
Commission finds that circumstances or conditions relating to the particular
application are such that one or more of the requirements listed below are
not necessary or desirable for the protection of the surrounding property or
the public health, safety, and general welfare, and that such special
conditions or circumstances make one or more said requirements unreasonable,
the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, may modify or
waive such requirement, either permanently or on a temporary basis. Any such
modification or waiver shall be requested by the applicant, and the applicant
shall submit a written justification for each requested modification or
waiver.

All structures constructed in connection with monopole or alternative
cellular antenna tower shall comply with the applicable setback requirements
established for other structures within the applicable zoning district.
Alternative cellular antenna towers that are to be located as part of a
utility service facility (eg. power pole or telephone pole) shall comply with
setback requirements applicable to such utility service facilities, if any.



      (4)   Height. A cellular antenna tower, or alternative antenna
tower structure, may be constructed to a maximum height of 200 feet
regardless of the maximum height requirements listed in the specific zoning
district. This also applies to any tower taller than 15 feet constructed on
the top of another building or structure, with the height being the overall
height of building/structure and tower together, measured from the grade to
the highest point. The Planning Commission may allow antennas greater than
200 feet in height upon review of the applicant's justification that the
additional height meets the criteria identified in subsection (F) of this
section.



      (5)   Construction standards. The cellular antenna tower shall
be constructed in compliance with the current ANSI/EIA/TIA 222-F standard and
other applicable state standards.

fences made from wood or other materials (less than 50% open) shall be used
to enclose the site. Such fences shall not be less than four feet and no more
than eight feet in height, and may be located within the front, side, or rear
yard.



      (9)   Screening. Screening shall be provided by evergreen
trees, with a minimum height of six feet, planted in a staggered pattern at a
maximum distance of 15 feet on center. The screening shall be placed in an
area between the property line, or lease line, and a ten foot setback.
Screening shall be required when located in or adjacent to a residential zone.



      (10)   Surfacing. All driveways and off-street parking areas
shall be paved with a durable surface such as asphalt or concrete.



      (11)   Signs. There shall be no signs permitted, except those
displaying emergency information, owner contact information, warning or
safety instructions, or signs that are required by a federal, state or local
agency. Such signs shall not exceed six square feet in area.



      (12)   Number of service providers. All new cellular antenna
towers shall be designed and constructed to accommodate a minimum of three
service providers.

Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Kentucky Airport Zoning Commission
(KAZC) or documentation where approval is not required shall be submitted
prior to the issuance of a building permit for the construction of the
cellular antenna tower.



   (F)   Criteria. Approval or disapproval of the proposal shall be
based upon an evaluation of the proposal's agreement with the comprehensive
plan and zoning regulations.



      (1)   The Planning Commission may require the applicant to
make a reasonable attempt to co-locate additional transmitting or related
equipment. The Planning Commission may provide the location of existing
cellular antenna towers on which the commission deems the applicant can
successfully co-locate its transmitting and related equipment. If the
Planning commission requires the applicant to attempt co-location, the
applicant shall provide the Planning Commission with a statement indicating
that the applicant has:



         (a)   Successfully attempted to co-locate on towers
designed to host multiple wireless service providers' facilities or existing
structures such as a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure
capable of supporting the applicant's facilities, and that identifies the
location of the tower or suitable structure on which the applicant will
co-locate its transmission and related facilities; or



         (b)   Unsuccessfully attempted to co-locate on towers
designed to host multiple wireless service provider's facilities or existing
structure such as a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure
capable of supporting the applicant's facilities and that:



            i.   Identifies the location of the towers or
other structures on which the applicant attempted to co-located; and



            ii.   Lists the reasons why the co-location was
unsuccessful in each instance.



      (2)   The Planning Commission may deny a uniform application
to construct a cellular antenna tower based on an applicant's unwillingness
to attempt to co-locate additional transmitting or related equipment on any
new or existing towers or other structures.



      (3)   The Planning Commission shall not regulate the placement
of a cellular antenna tower on the basis of the environmental effects of
radio frequency emissions to the extent that the proposed facility complies
with the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission concerning
radio frequency emissions.



   (G)   Abandonment and dismantling. Any cellular antenna tower
including but not limited to guyed, lattice and monopole cellular antenna
towers, alternative cellular antenna towers, antennas and related equipment,
(hereinafter referred to as “structure”) shall be deemed abandoned when
such structure is removed from or no longer in service for a period in excess
of 30 days. At the point in time any structure is considered to be abandoned
within the meaning of this section, the structure shall be disassembled and
removed from the property upon which is located within 60 days thereafter.



   (H)   Amendments.  Any amendments to plans, except for minor
adjustments as determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, shall be made in accordance with the procedure required by
division (E), subject to the same limitations and requirements as those under
which such plans were originally approved.

§ 156.081  CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.



   (A)   The Board of Zoning Adjustments shall have the power to hear
and decide applications for conditional use permits to allow the proper
integration into the planning area of uses which are specifically named in
this zoning code which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone
only if certain conditions are met.



   (B)   The Board may approve, modify, or deny any application for
conditional use permit.  If it approves such permit, it may attach necessary
conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or more things be
done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a continuing
nature.  Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board's minutes and on
the conditional use permit, along with a reference to the specific section in
this zoning code listing the conditional use under consideration.  The Board
shall have the power to revoke conditional use permits, or variance for
noncompliance with the condition thereof.  Furthermore, the Board shall have
a right of action to compel offending structures of uses removed at the cost
of the violator and may have judgment in personam for such cost.



   (C)   The granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the
applicant from complying with all the requirements of building, housing, and
other regulations.



   (D)   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been
exercised within the time limit set by the Board, or within one year, if no
specific time limit has been set, the granting of such conditional use permit
shall be reconsidered by the Board of Zoning Adjustments.  "Exercised" as
set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for the
construction of the main building or other improvement have been let; or in
the absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is under
construction to a substantial degree or that prerequisite conditions
involving substantial investment shall be under contract, in development, or
completed.  When construction is not a part of the use, "exercised" shall
mean that the use is in operation in compliance with the conditions as set
forth in the permit.



   (E)   The Zoning Official shall review all conditional use permits,
except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at
least once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure
where the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner
is complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional
use permit.  If the landowner is not complying with all conditions listed on
the conditional use permit, the Zoning Official shall report the fact in
writing to the Chairman of the Board of Zoning Adjustments.  The Board shall
hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time, and notice of the time
and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one
week prior to the hearing.  If the Board of Zoning Adjustments finds that
the facts alleged in the report of the Zoning Official are true and that the
landowner has taken no steps to comply with them between the date of the
report and the date of the hearing, the Board may authorize the Zoning
Official to revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal
action to cause the termination of the activity on the land which the
conditional use permit authorizes.



   (F)   Once the Board of Zoning Adjustments has granted a conditional
use permit and all of the conditions required are of such type that they can
be completely and permanently satisfied, the Zoning Official, upon request of
the applicant, may if the facts warrant, make a determination that the
conditions have been satisfied and enter the facts which indicate that the
conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion of the margin of the copy
of the conditional use permit which is on file with the County Clerk, as
required in KRS 100.3681.  Thereafter said use, if it continues to meet the
other requirements of the regulations, will be treated as a permitted use.

§ 156.082  DIMENSIONAL VARIANCES.



   (A)   The Board of Zoning Adjustments shall have the power to hear
and decide on applications for dimensional variances where, by reason of the
exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape of a site on the date
of adoption or amendment of this zoning code or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions, or some other extraordinary situation or condition of
that site, the literal enforcement of the dimensional requirements (height or
width of building or size of yards, but not population density) of this
zoning code would deprive the applicant of reasonable capacity to make use of
the land in a manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the
same zone.  The Board may impose any reasonable conditions or restrictions
on any variance it decides to grant.



   (B)   Before any variance is granted, the Board must find that the
granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety
or welfare, will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity,
will not cause a hazard or a nuisance to the public, and will not allow an
unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In
making these findings, the board shall consider whether:



      (l)   The requested variance arises from special circumstances
which do not generally apply to land in the general vicinity, or in the same
zone.



      (2)   The strict application of the provisions of the
regulation would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or
would create an unnecessary hardship on the applicant



      (3)   The circumstances are the result of actions of the
applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from
which relief is sought.



   (C)   The Board shall deny any request for a variance arising from
circumstance s that are the result of willful violations of the zoning
regulation by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the zoning
regulation from which relief is sought.



   (D)   The Board shall not possess the power to grant a variance to
permit a use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by
this zoning code in the zone in question, or, to alter density requirements
in the zone in question.



   (E)   A dimensional variance applies to the property for which it is
granted, and not the individual who applied for it.  A variance also runs
with the land and is transferable to any future owner of the land, but it
cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different site.

§ 156.083  APPEALS.



   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Adjustments may be taken by any person
or entity claiming to be injuriously affected or aggrieved by an official
action or decision of the Zoning Official.  Such appeal shall be taken
within 30 days after the appellant or his agent receives notice of the action
appealed from, by filing with the Officer and with the Board a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and giving notice of such appeal to
any and all parties of record.  The Officer shall forthwith transmit to the
Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken and shall be treated as and be the respondent in such further
proceedings.  At any hearing by the Board any interested person may appear
and enter his appearance and all shall be given an opportunity to be heard. 
The Board shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give public
notice in accordance with KRS Chapter 424, as well as written notice to the
appellant and the Zoning Official at least one week prior to the hearing, and
shall decide it within 60 days.  The affected party may appear at the
hearing in person or by attorney.

provided by KRS Chapter 100.  Appointments and terms are made as provided
for by state law and local city ordinances.



   (B)   Proceedings.



      (1)   The Planning Commission shall conduct monthly meetings
on the third Tuesday of each month.  The meeting date and time may be
changed by mutual agreement of the Planning Commission.  The establishment
of this regular date does not preclude the Planning Commission from
scheduling additional public hearings whenever such meetings are deemed
necessary.



      (2)   The Chairman of the Planning Commission shall give seven
days written or oral notice of a special meeting.  The notice shall contain
the date, time, and place of the meeting, and the subject or subjects which
will be discussed.  The Planning commission shall conduct business only when
a majority of the total membership is present constituting a quorum.  The
Commission may adopt bylaws for the transaction of business and shall keep
minutes and records of all proceedings, including regulations, transactions,
findings, determinations, the number of votes for and against each question,
whether any member is absent or abstains from voting, all of which shall

transcript of the minutes of the commission meeting shall be provided if
requested by a party, at the expense of the requesting party, and the
transcript shall constitute the record.



   (C)   Powers.  The Murray Planning Commission shall have the
following general powers.  The commission may employ or contract with
planners or other persons as it deems necessary to accomplish its assigned
duties.  The Commission shall have the right to receive, hold, and spend

   (D)   Other authority.  The Planning Commission, in addition to its
other responsibilities concerning adoption and amendment of this chapter, has
the authority and responsibility for reviewing all planned development
projects.  This responsibility, like subdivision plat review, involves
guiding the initial disposition of land including the proper arrangement of
streets in relation to other existing or planned streets, provision of
adequate open space, and the avoidance of congestion and is consequently
equivalent to the Planning Commission's primary responsibility for
subdivision plat review and approval.



   (E)   Administrative procedure.



      (1)   The circuit court has jurisdiction to determine all
questions and issues properly brought before it on appeal from decisions of

§ 156.093  STORM WATER CONVEYANCE FACILITIES AND WATER QUALITY DESIGN
CRITERIA.



   The following criteria shall control when designing storm water
conveyance facilities and water quality control structures:



   (A)   Open channels and roadside ditches. The design storm for the
design of open channels and roadside ditches shall be a storm with a
recurrence frequency of ten year/24-hour duration. The time of concentration
for open channel and roadside ditch design should be assumed to be 15 minutes.



   (B)   Storm sewers and inlets. The design storm for the design of
storm sewers and inlets shall be the 25-year storm/24-hour duration (TR-55
Method and Rational Method). The duration of the peak rainfall event shall be
assumed to be equal to the calculated time of concentration. Storm sewers and
inlets shall be checked under 25-year storm/24-hour duration (TR-55 Method
and Rational Method) loading conditions for ponding limits. The ponding limit
for streets with curb and gutter shall be an eight-foot spread measured from
gutter to driving lane. Spread calculations shall be based upon an intensity
of four inches per hour. Pipes should be sized based upon the actual time of
concentration. The minimum time of concentration should be assumed to be
eight minutes.



   (C)   Entrance pipes and cross drains. The design storm for the
design of entrance pipes and cross drains shall be the 25-year storm/24-hour
duration (TR-55 Method and Rational Method). The duration of the peak
rainfall event shall be assumed to be equal to the calculated time of
concentration. The minimum time of concentration shall be assumed to be eight
minutes.  Entrance pipes and cross drains shall be checked for overtopping
of roadways and flood damage to affected areas. Situations requiring pipes
larger than 36 inches shall be designed using the culvert criteria in
division (D) of this section, below.



   (D)   Culverts and cross drains. The design storm for the
calculation of runoff for culvert design shall be the 25-year storm. The
duration of the peak rainfall event shall be assumed to be equal to the
calculated time of concentration.  The recommended check storm is the
100-year storm. The maximum headwater under 100-year storm conditions should
not be allowed to overtop roads or increase the flooding potential in the
affected areas.



   (E)   Erosion control. Plans for storm water conveyance systems
shall include appropriately designed temporary and permanent erosion-control
measures both for the open channel conduits and all disturbed land draining
to both open and closed conduits within the system. (Best Management
Practices for Construction Activities prepared by the Kentucky Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet and § 156.36 of this
subchapter should be used as design guides for erosion and sediment control).



     (F)   Water quality control structures. The design rainfall event
for the design of all stormwater quality control structures shall be the
surface depth of runoff produced from an 80th percentile precipitation event.
Stormwater quality control structures shall be designed, built and maintained
to treat filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen, evapo-transpire, harvest and
reuse stormwater runoff, or otherwise manage the stormwater runoff quality
for the 80th percentile precipitation event. Green infrastructure devices may
be used as water quality control structures if they meet the design criteria.



   (G)   Design certification. Design of all storm water conveyance and
water quality facilities shall be prepared and stamped by a licensed
professional engineer (Kentucky registration required). Design methods shall
be in accordance with the Kentucky Department of Highways Manual of
Instructions for Drainage Design, latest edition.

hearing, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting or otherwise acting as
to any work, business, or matter under this ordinance.  The Mayor shall by

(Ord. 94-1023, passed 6-23-94)



§ 157.10  ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory
housing practice or who believes that he will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter "person
aggrieved") may file a complaint with the Mayor.  Complaints shall be in
writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as the Mayor
requires.  Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Mayor shall furnish a copy
of the same to the person or persons who allegedly committed or are about to
commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice.  Within thirty (30) days
after receiving a complaint, or within thirty (30) days after the expiration
of any period of reference under subsection (C), the Mayor shall investigate
the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he
intends to resolve it.  If the Mayor decides to resolve the complaint, he
shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory
housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and
persuasion.  Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors
may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this
chapter without the written consent of the persons concerned.  Any employee
of the Mayor who shall make public any information in violation of this
provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof
shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year.



   (B)   A complaint under subsection (A) shall be filed within one
hundred and eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing
practice occurred.  Complaints shall be in writing and shall state the facts
upon which the allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are based. 
Complaints may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time.  A respondent
may file an answer to the complaint against him and with the leave of the
Mayor, which shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do
so, may amend his answer at any time.  Both complaints and answers shall be
verified.



   (C)   If within thirty (30) days after a complaint is filed with the
Mayor, the Mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this
ordinance, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days thereafter, file
a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.  The Mayor will assist in this filing.



   (D)   If the Mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance
within thirty (30) days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within
thirty (30) days thereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court,
against the respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted
or protected by this ordinance, insofar as such rights relate to the subject
of the complaint.  If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice
has occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from
engaging in such practice or order such affirmative action as may be
appropriate.



   (E)   In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden
of proof shall be on the complainant.



   (F)   Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial,
the Mayor shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain voluntary
compliance.



(Ord. 94-1023, passed 6-23-94)



§ 157.11  INVESTIGATIONS: SUBPOENA - GIVING OF EVIDENCE.



   (A)   In conducting an investigation the Mayor shall have access at
all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals, and other
evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record, and copy
such materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such
persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation;
provided however, that the Mayor first complies with the provisions of the
Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution relating to unreasonable
searches and seizures.  The Mayor may issue subpoenas to compel his access
to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons,
and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject
to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories
were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States district
court for the district in which the investigation is taking place.  The
Mayor may administer oaths.



   (B)   Upon written application to the Mayor, a respondent shall be
entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the
name of the Mayor to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as
subpoenas issued by the Mayor himself.  Subpoenas issued at the request of a
respondent shall show on their face the name and address of such respondent
and shall state that they were issued at his request.



   (C)   Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the Mayor shall be entitled
to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in
United States district courts.  Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him.



   (D)   Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any
person, such person may petition the Mayor to revoke or modify the
subpoena.  The Mayor shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena
requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it
requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under
investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the
evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for
other good reason.



   (E)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Mayor
or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its
enforcement in the state court for the district in which the person to whom
the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.



   (F)   Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and
testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or
other evidence, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or
lawful order of the Mayor shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned
not more than one year, or both.  Any person who, with intent thereby to
mislead the Mayor, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or
statement of fact in any report, account, record, or other document submitted
to the Mayor pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or shall willfully
neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true, and correct entries
in such reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or shall willfully
mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any documentary evidence,
shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or
both.



   (G)   The City Attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the
Mayor participates as a part or as amicus pursuant to this chapter.



(Ord. 94-1023, passed 6-23-94)



§ 157.12  ENFORCEMENT BY PRIVATE PERSONS



   The rights granted by §§ 157.03 - 157.06 may be enforced by civil
actions in state courts of general jurisdiction.  A civil action shall be
commenced within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the alleged
discriminatory housing practice occurred, provided however, that the court
shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or sections
157.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the Mayor are likely to result in
satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complaint or
in the compliant made to the Mayor and which practice forms the basis for the
action in court and provided however, that any sale encumbrance, or rental
consummated prior to the issuance of any court order issued under the
authority of this chapter, and involving a bona fidepurchaser, encumbrancer,
or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint
or civil action under the provision of this chapter shall not be affected.



   (B)   The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any
permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other
order, and may award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000
punitive damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in
the case of a prevailing plaintiff, provided that the said plaintiff in the
opinion of the court is not financially able to assume said attorney's fees.

exercised or enjoyed, or on account of his having aided or encouraged any
other person in the exercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or protected
by §§ 157.03 - 157.06.  This section may be enforced by appropriate civil
action.

§ 157.14  PREVENTION OF INTIMIDATION IN FAIR HOUSING CASES.

dwellings; or

      (2)   affording another person or class of persons opportunity
or protection so to participate; or
