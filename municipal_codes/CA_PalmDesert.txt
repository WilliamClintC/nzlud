Actions recommended by the staff shall be in summary form and be a part of that item. Adoption of the consent calendar may be made by one motion only by the city council; provided, however, that the presiding officer should first advise the audience that the consent calendar matters will be adopted in total by one action of the city council unless any council member or any individual or organization interested in one or more consent calendar items wishes to be heard.

The business of the city council shall be conducted in substantially the order and in the manner as provided in this chapter and, so far as practicable, in accordance with parliamentary rules as laid down in Robert’s Rules of Order (Revised); provided, however, that a failure to observe or enforce such rules shall in no manner affect the regularity, validity, or legality of any action or proceedings taken by the council, and the city council in its discretion and in accordance with its right to govern its own proceedings, reserves the right to proceed at any time otherwise than as prescribed or indicated in Robert’s Rules of Order.

2.36.230 Failure to observe rules of order.
     Rules adopted to expedite the transaction of the business of the city council in an orderly fashion are deemed to be procedural only, and the failure to strictly observe such rules shall not affect the jurisdiction of the council or invalidate any action taken at a meeting that is otherwise held in conformity with law. (Ord. 83 § 23, 1975)

 

2.36.240 Propriety of conduct—City council.
     Members of the city council must preserve order and decorum and shall not by conversation or otherwise delay nor interrupt the proceedings of the council in any way, nor disturb any other member of the council while speaking, nor refuse to obey the orders of the council or the presiding officer, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. (Ord. 83 § 24, 1975)

 

2.36.250 Propriety of conduct—Procedure.
     Each person desiring to address the city council shall approach the podium, state his or her name and address for the record, state the subject he or she wishes to discuss, state whom he or she is representing if he or she represents an organization or other persons, and unless further time is granted by majority vote of the council, shall limit his or her remarks to three minutes. All remarks shall be addressed to the council as a whole and not to any member thereof. No questions shall be asked of a councilperson or member of the city staff without obtaining permission of the presiding officer. Any person violating this section while addressing the city council shall be called to order by the presiding officer, and if such conduct continues, may at the discretion of the presiding officer be ordered barred from further audience, and if the conduct warrants, such person may be ordered removed from the council chambers. (Ord. 1242 § 1, 2012; Ord. 83 § 25, 1975)

 

2.36.260 Addressing the council—Spokesperson.
     In order to expedite matters and to avoid repetitious presentations, whenever any group of persons wishes to address the city council on the same subject matter, it shall be proper for the presiding officer to inquire whether or not the group has a spokesperson and, if so, that he or she be heard with subsequent speakers in the group being limited to facts not already presented by the group spokesperson. Any individual representing several other persons or group of persons should file with the city clerk written authorization from such persons to speak on their behalf. Preferably the written authorization should be filed prior to the time of the meeting at which the individuals desire to speak, and the authorization should refer to the subject matter of the meeting. (Ord. 83 § 26, 1975)

 

2.36.270 Addressing the council—Members of the audience.
     Any person in the audience who engages in disorderly conduct such as handclapping, stamping of feet, whistling, using profane language, yelling, and similar demonstrations, which conduct disturbs the peace and good order of the meeting, or who refuses to comply with the lawful orders of the presiding officer, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and after request from the presiding officer, the law enforcement officer present shall remove any such person from the council chambers and place him or her under arrest. (Ord. 83 § 27, 1975)

 

2.36.280 Enforcement of order.
     The chief of police or such member or members of the police department as he or she may designate, shall attend each city council meeting as requested by the city manager, and shall carry out all orders given by the presiding officer for the purpose of maintaining order at the council meetings. Any councilperson may move to require the presiding officer to enforce the rules and the affirmative vote of a majority of the council shall require him or her to do so. (Ord. 83 § 28, 1975)

 

2.36.290 Voting procedures.
     Any vote of the city council, including a roll call vote, may be registered by the members by answering “yes” for an affirmative vote or “no” for a negative vote upon his or her name being called by the city clerk, or by activating any electronic voting equipment utilized by the city council. The result of any vote registered by means of a lighting system shall be audibly announced by the city clerk and recorded by the minutes as the vote. (Ord. 83 § 29, 1975)

 

2.36.300 Disqualification for conflict of interest.
     Any councilperson who is disqualified from voting on a particular matter by reason of a conflict of interest shall publicly state, or have the presiding officer state, the nature of such disqualification in the open city council meeting. Where no clearly disqualifying conflict of interest appears, the matter of disqualification may, at the request of the councilperson affected, be decided by the other councilpersons. A councilperson who is disqualified by reason of a conflict of interest in any matter shall remove him or herself from the council chamber. A councilperson stating such disqualification shall not be counted as a part of a quorum and shall be considered absent for the purpose of determining the outcome of any vote on such matter. (Ord. 1242 § 2, 2012; Ord. 83 § 30, 1975)

 

2.36.310 Failure to vote.
     Every councilperson should vote unless disqualified by reason of a conflict of interest. A councilperson who abstains from voting by so announcing acknowledges that a majority of the quorum may decide the question voted upon. A councilperson who is silent or inattentive and fails to vote without stating his abstention or without being disqualified is deemed to have cast a “yes” vote. (Ord. 83 § 31, 1975)

 

2.36.320 Tie vote.
     Tie votes shall be lost motions or “no action” and the matter voted upon may be subject to further city council consideration. (Ord. 83 § 32, 1975)

 

2.36.330 Changing vote.
     A member may change his or her vote only if he or she makes a timely request to do so immediately following the announcement of the vote by the city clerk and prior to the time the next item in the order of business is taken up. A councilperson who publicly announces that he or she is abstaining from voting on a particular matter shall not subsequently be allowed to withdraw his or her abstention. (Ord. 83 § 33, 1975)

 

2.36.340 Reconsideration.
     A motion to reconsider any action taken by the city council may be made only at the meeting such action was taken. It may be made either immediately during the same session, or at a recessed or adjourned session thereof. Such motion may be made only by one of the councilpersons who voted with the prevailing side. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any councilperson from making or remarking the same or any other motion at a subsequent meeting of the council. (Ord. 83 § 34, 1975)

 

2.36.350 Ordinances, resolutions and contracts.
     All ordinances, resolutions and contracts shall either be prepared or approved by the city attorney. No ordinance shall be prepared for presentation to the city council unless ordered by the whole council, the city manager, or prepared by the city attorney on his or her own initiative. All department heads shall route requests for ordinances through the city manager. (Ord. 83 § 35, 1975)

 

2.36.360 Prior approval by administrative staff.
     All ordinances, resolutions and contract documents shall, before presentation to the city council, have been approved as to form and compliance with all applicable laws by the city attorney, and shall have been examined and approved for convenience of administrative application by the city manager or authorized representative. (Ord. 83 § 36, 1975)

 

2.36.370 Reading of ordinances and resolutions.
     At the time of adoption of an ordinance or resolution, the same shall be read in full unless after the reading, or having read the title, further reading thereof is waived by four-fifths consent of the councilpersons present. Such consent may be expressed by a statement by the presiding officer that “If there is no objection, the further reading of the ordinance or resolution shall be waived.” (Ord. 83 § 37, 1975)

 

2.36.380 Public hearings—When held.
     Wherever by law the city council is required to hold a public hearing on any matter before it, such hearing will be held in accordance with the rules and procedures set forth in this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit or limit the city council from holding a public hearing on any matter before it, whether required by law or not, and nothing shall prevent the city council from hearing members of the public if a majority of the council so determines in their discretion. (Ord. 83 § 38, 1975)

 

2.36.390 Public hearings—Opening.
     After the mayor has announced that the time has arrived for a public hearing on any scheduled agenda item set for public hearing, the mayor shall announce that it is the time and place for the public hearing, and shall ascertain whether or not anyone wishes to be heard on the agenda item under consideration. If there are persons present wishing to be heard, the presiding officer shall request that those in opposition to the matter under consideration be heard first, and the persons shall be given an opportunity to address the city council in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.36.250 through and including Section 2.36.270 of this chapter. (Ord. 83 § 39, 1975)

 

2.36.400 Public hearings—Evidence received.
     During the public hearing, the city council shall receive oral or written evidence relevant to the matter being considered, and the presiding officer or any member of the council through the presiding officer may require the city clerk to swear any person giving evidence at the time of the hearing on the matter under consideration, if in the opinion of the presiding officer or any member of the city council the oath is necessary. Evidence received at public hearing provided for in this chapter shall be relevant and material to the issues before the council; provided, however, that the rules of evidence as established by the Evidence Code of the state shall be substantially relaxed in order to afford a full presentation of the facts essential for judicious consideration by the city council of the matter which is the subject of the public hearing. The city council may order the city clerk to issue, and the chief of police or his representative to serve, subpoenas for any witnesses or records necessary for the production of evidence at any duly scheduled public hearing, as provided for in this chapter. (Ord. 83 § 40, 1975)

 

2.36.410 Public hearings—Continuation.
     At any time that it appears to the presiding officer or a majority of the city council through the presiding officer that inadequate evidence has been presented to afford judicious consideration of any matter before the council at the time of a public hearing, a continuation of the hearing may be ordered to afford the applicant, his or her opponents, or the city staff adequate time to assemble additional evidence for the city council’s consideration. Any continuation ordered by the city council through its presiding officer shall be to a date certain, which date shall be publicly announced in the council chambers and shall constitute notice to the applicant and his or her opponent of the time and place that further evidence will be taken. A public hearing may be continued in the event the matter is to be returned to the planning commission for further consideration. In this event, the presiding officer shall publicly state in open council meeting the fact that the matter has been returned to the planning commission for consideration and that the council hearing will be continued to a date certain. The public announcements provided for in this section shall constitute notice to the applicant and his or her opponents of the time and place when further evidence will be taken by the city council. (Ord. 83 § 41, 1975)

 

2.36.420 Public hearings—Closing.
     When neither the applicant, his or her opponents, or the city staff have further evidence to produce or when, in the opinion of the presiding officer or the majority of the city council through the presiding officer, sufficient evidence has been presented, the presiding officer shall order the public hearing closed, at which time no further evidence, either oral or written, will be accepted by the city council; provided, however, that this rule may be relaxed by the presiding officer or the majority of the city council through the presiding officer where it appears that good cause exists to hear further evidence concerning the matter which is the subject of the public hearing. (Ord. 83 § 42, 1975)

 

2.36.430 Public hearings—Reopening.
     A public hearing on any matter once closed cannot be reopened on the date set for hearing unless the presiding officer can and has determined that none of the parties involved in such hearing have left the council chambers. Nothing in this chapter, however, is intended to prevent or prohibit the reopening of a public hearing at any subsequent regular or special meeting of the city council. No public hearing may be reopened without due and proper notice being given to the applicant and his or her opponents designating the time and place of the reopening unless reopened in accordance with this section at the same meeting. (Ord. 1242 § 3, 2012; Ord. 83 § 43, 1975)

 

2.36.440 Minutes.
     The official minutes of the city council will be kept by the city clerk in a minute book with a record of each particular type of business transacted set off in paragraph form with proper subheadings. The city clerk shall be required to make a record only of such business as was actually passed upon by the city council and shall not be required to record any remarks of any members of the council or of any other person except at the special request of a member of the council. The city clerk shall enter into the minutes the reasons for dissent from or protest against any action of the city council if any member of the council so requests. Names and addresses of persons addressing the council, the title of the subject matter to which their remarks are related, and whether they spoke in support of or in opposition to such matter shall be entered in the minutes. (Ord. 83 § 44, 1975)

 

2.36.450 Tape recordings.
     The city clerk will electronically record all city council meetings as a stenographic aid, and will retain the recording tapes at least until the written minutes of the meeting are approved by the council. The city council may order full tapes or portions thereof retained for longer periods. On matters likely to result in litigation, tapes shall be retained for at least one year. (Ord. 83 § 45, 1975)

 

2.36.460 Distribution of minutes.
     As soon as possible after each meeting, the city clerk shall furnish a copy of the minutes to each councilperson, the city manager, city attorney, each department head, and any other individuals designated by the city clerk or the city manager. (Ord. 83 § 46, 1975)

 

2.36.470 Reading the minutes.
     Unless the reading of the minutes of a city council meeting is requested by a member of the council, the minutes may be approved without reading if the clerk has previously furnished each member of the council with a copy thereof. (Ord. 83 § 47, 1975)

     B.     The terms of officeholders shall be extended as necessary, but no more than twelve months. (Ord. 896 §§ 1, 2, 1999; Ord. 740 § 1, 1994; Ord. 281 § 1, 1981)

 

2.38.020 Applicability.
     The first general municipal election to which this chapter shall apply is the one to be held in the year 1995. (Ord. 740 § 2, 1994; Ord. 281 § 2, 1981)

 

 

2.38.030 Declaration of election and selection of mayor.
     The city council shall meet at the next regularly scheduled meeting following presentation of the twenty-eight-day canvass of the returns of the most recent municipal election and shall declare the results thereof and install newly elected officers, pursuant to Sections 10262 and 10263 of the California Elections Code, and, following such declaration and installation, at the same meeting choose one of its members as mayor and one of its members as mayor pro-tempore, pursuant to Section 36801 of the California Government Code. (Ord. 1095 § 1, 2005)

 

2.38.040 Election of city council.
     A.    Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:

     1.     “By district,” as used in this section, shall mean election of members of the city council by voters of the district alone.

     2.     “Geographical area making up the district” shall mean the district.

     B.     Number of Districts. Pursuant to Government Code Section 34871(a), the city of Palm Desert is divided into two council districts.

     C.     Boundaries and Numbering of Each District. Descriptions of the boundaries of each district and their numbering are as shown on Exhibit A along with a map entitled “City of Palm Desert District Map,” a copy of which shall be on file in the city clerk’s office.

 

 



Exhibit A

 

 

     D.    Election of City Council. Members of the city council shall be elected “by districts” from two districts as provided herein. One of the districts, including approximately twenty percent of the city’s residents, would encompass the Civic Center Core and elect one council member. The second district would include the remainder of the city (about eighty percent of the residents) and elect four council members. Except as provided in subsection F, entitled Transition to District Elections, a council member of either district must live in that district and must be a registered voter in that district to be eligible to hold office for that district. Only voters who live in a district shall be eligible to vote in the election for council member(s) of that district.

     E.     Amendment of District Boundaries. Pursuant to Elections Code Section 21601, as it may be amended, the city council shall adjust the boundaries of any or both of the districts following each decennial federal census. Using the census as a basis, the city council shall adjust the boundaries in compliance with all applicable provisions of law.

     At the time of any annexation of territory to the city, the city council shall designate, by resolution adopted by a vote of at least a majority of the city council, the contiguous district to which the annexed territory shall be a part and shall amend the district boundaries if necessary in accordance with Elections Code Section 21603, as it may be amended.

     Pursuant to Elections Code Section 21606, the term of office of any council member who has been elected and whose term of office has not expired shall not be affected by any change in the boundaries of the district from which he or she was elected, whether or not that council member is a resident within the boundaries of the district as adjusted. At the first election for council following adjustment of the boundaries of the districts, a person meeting the requirements of Government Code Section 34882 shall be elected to the city council for each district under the readjusted district plan that has the same district number as a district whose incumbent’s term on the council is due to expire.

     F.     Transition to District Elections. In 2020, one council member shall be elected by district 1and two council members shall be elected from District 2. In 2022, two council members shall be elected from District 2. Terms of office shall be four years. Each incumbent council member elected at large shall be allowed to complete the term for which they are elected regardless of the district of residency so long as they otherwise remain eligible to hold the office and have not been removed for cause or elected to another office. (Ord. 1356 § 2, 2020)

 

2.38.050 Ranked choice voting.
     A.    General Provisions.

     1.     Ranked choice voting is a method that allows voters to rank candidates for elected office in order of preference. Elections conducted by ranked choice voting are tabulated in rounds, as specified in this section.

     2.     For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:

     a.     “Batch elimination” means the simultaneous defeat of two or more continuing candidates because it is mathematically impossible for those candidates to receive enough votes to become designated as elected before being designated as defeated.

     b.     “Continuing candidate” means a candidate who has not yet been designated as elected or defeated.

     c.     “Election threshold” means the number of votes sufficient for a candidate to be elected in a multi-seat contest. The election threshold equals the total votes counted in the first round of tabulation, divided by the sum of one plus the number of offices to be filled, then adding one, disregarding any fractions. Winning threshold = ((Total votes cast)/(Seats to be elected+1)) +1, with any fraction disregarded. The Secretary of State may approve alternate formulas to calculate the election threshold as long as any alternate formula produces a threshold that is no greater than the total votes counted in the first round of tabulation divided by the number of offices to be filled ((Total votes cast)/(Seats to be elected)), nor no smaller than the total votes counted in the first round of tabulation divided by one more than the number of offices to be filled, then adding one, disregarding any fractions ((Total votes cast)/(Seats to be elected+1) +1).

     d.     “Elimination batch” means a group of two or more candidates who can be simultaneously defeated through batch elimination because it is mathematically impossible for those candidates to be elected.

     e.     “Highest-ranked continuing candidate” means the ranking on a voter’s ballot with the lowest numerical value for a continuing candidate, i.e., 2nd is lower than 3rd, and equals a higher rank.

     f.      “Inactive ballot” means a ballot that does not contain a continuing candidate, or that has reached an overvote, making the ballot unable to be transferred to another continuing candidate.

     g.     “Multiseat election” means an election in which two or more candidates can be designated as elected in a single contest to fill multiple seats in the same publicly elected office. This may also be referred to as a multi-winner election. Multiseat elections using ranked choice voting may be referred to as single transferable vote.

     h.     “Overvote” means an instance in which a voter has ranked more than one candidate at the same ranking.

     i.      “Ranking” means the number assigned to a candidate that establishes the order in which a ballot is transferred to that candidate. The ranking with the lowest numerical value indicates the voter’s highest-ranked continuing candidate, with the rankings increasing in numerical value for the voter’s lower-ranked continuing candidates.

     j.      “Seat” means an elected position occupied by one person, one or more of which form a publicly elected office.

     k.     “Skipped ranking” means a voter has left a ranking order unassigned but ranks a candidate at a subsequent ranking order.

     l.      “Surplus” or “surplus fraction” means a number equal to the quotient of the difference between an elected candidate’s vote total and the election threshold, divided by the candidate’s vote total (or (V-T)/V, in which “V” is the elected candidate’s vote total and “T” is the election threshold), rounded down to four decimal places, ignoring any remainder.

     m.    “Transfer value” means the proportion of a vote that a ballot will contribute to its highest-ranked continuing candidate. Each ballot begins with a transfer value of 1. If a ballot contributes to the election of a candidate under subsection (B)(4)(b)(2), it receives a new transfer value.

     3.     a. A ballot that does not contain a continuing candidate shall count as an inactive ballot.

     b.     If a ballot contains a skipped ranking, the ballot shall be transferred to the highest-ranked continuing candidate.

     c.     If a ballot contains an overvote, it shall count as an inactive ballot when the overvote is reached.

     4.     If two or more candidates are tied with the fewest number of votes and cannot be defeated through batch elimination, the candidate to be defeated shall be determined by lot.

     5.     If a special election to fill one or more vacancies with ranked choice voting is consolidated with an election to elect one or more other members of the elected body to full terms using ranked choice voting to create a single, multiseat election, the full terms shall be awarded to the candidates declared elected first, and the vacancies awarded to the candidates declared elected last. If two or more candidates are declared elected in the same round, the candidates with larger surpluses shall be considered elected before the candidates with smaller surpluses, in the order of the size of the surplus. If two or more candidates that are declared elected in the same round have equal surpluses, the order of their election shall be determined by lot.

     B.     Vote Counting.

     1.     This subsection establishes the procedures for electing candidates in multiseat elections using ranked choice voting.

     2.     A ballot shall allow voters to assign a different ranking to every candidate, as well as to write-in candidates. If the city’s voting equipment cannot feasibly accommodate that number of rankings on the ballot, the elections official (the “elections official” is the city clerk of the city of Palm Desert) may limit the number of choices a voter may rank to the maximum number allowed by the equipment.

     3.     In an election conducted by ranked choice voting, the elections official shall provide ballot instructions that make clear the proper voting procedures for voting in a ranked choice voting election.

     4.     In a multiseat election conducted by ranked choice voting, tabulation proceeds in rounds as follows:

     a.     If, in the initial tabulation, the number of continuing candidates is less than or equal to the number of seats to be filled, then all continuing candidates are elected and tabulation is complete. Otherwise, tabulation proceeds to an additional round as described in paragraph (ii) of subdivision (4)(b).

     b.     An additional round of tabulation shall proceed as follows:

     i.      Each ballot shall count, at its current transfer value, for the highest-ranked continuing candidate on that ballot. If the number of elected candidates or the sum of the number of elected candidates and the number of continuing candidates is equal to the number of seats to be filled, then all continuing candidates are designated as elected, and tabulation is complete. Otherwise, the tabulation proceeds pursuant to paragraph (ii).

     ii.     If any continuing candidate has a number of votes greater than or equal to the election threshold for the contest, that candidate shall be designated as elected. Each ballot counting for an elected candidate is assigned a new transfer value by multiplying the ballot’s current transfer value by the surplus fraction for the elected candidate, rounded down to four decimal places and ignoring any remainder. If each of two or more candidates has a number of votes greater than or equal to the election threshold for the contest at the same time, the surpluses may be distributed simultaneously or in rounds in which the largest surplus is distributed first. Each candidate elected under this paragraph is deemed to have a number of votes equal to the election threshold for the contest in all future rounds and a new round begins pursuant to paragraph (i).

     iii.    If no candidate is elected pursuant to paragraph (ii), then, if batch elimination is used and any candidates qualify for an elimination batch, any candidates in the elimination batch are defeated through batch elimination. Otherwise the candidate with the fewest votes is defeated and votes for the defeated candidates shall be transferred to each ballot’s next-ranked continuing candidate and a new round begins pursuant to paragraph (i).

     5.     a. Jurisdictions using ranked choice voting may eliminate multiple candidates through batch elimination. If batch elimination is used, candidates shall be eliminated in batches as described in paragraph (iii) of subdivision (5)(b).

     b.     A continuing candidate is in the elimination batch if the number of elected and continuing candidates with more votes than that candidate is greater than or equal to the number of seats to be filled, and it is mathematically impossible for that candidate to be elected for any of the following reasons:

     i.      The candidate has fewer votes than any other continuing candidate.

     ii.     The candidate’s current vote total plus the sum of current votes for continuing candidates with fewer votes would not be enough to equal or surpass the continuing candidate with the next highest current vote total.

     iii.    The candidate has a lower current vote total than a continuing candidate described in paragraph (ii).

     c.     If a candidate is defeated through batch elimination, votes for that candidate shall be transferred to each ballot’s next-ranked continuing candidate.

     C.     Reporting.

     1.     For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:

     a.     “Ballot report” means a report that lists all of the following for each ballot counted in the tabulation:

     i.      The candidate or candidates indicated at each ranking.

     ii.     The precinct in which the ballot was cast.

     iii.    Whether the ballot was cast by mail.

     b.     “Summary report” means a report that lists all of the following:

     i.      The number of ballots counted.

     ii.     The votes received by each candidate in each round of the tabulation.

     iii.    The cumulative number of inactive ballots.

     iv.    Any additional information the jurisdiction chooses to include, such as the cumulative number of inactive ballots that were counted as inactive for any of the following reasons:

     (A)  The ballot reached an overvote.

     (B)   All candidates on the ballot were designated as elected or defeated.

     c.     “Comprehensive report” means a report that, for each precinct, lists all of the information required in a summary report.

     2.     a. An elections official shall publish a summary report for the final tabulation of the official canvass in conjunction with the certified statement of the results. The elections official shall also publish at least one of the following reports for the final tabulation of the official canvass:

     i.      A comprehensive report.

     ii.     A ballot report.

     b.     A report generated pursuant to this section shall reflect the vote count at the point when the votes have been counted toward each continuing candidate but before the transfer of elected candidates’ surplus or candidates have been subsequently designated as defeated.

When the employee is relieved of the acting appointment, the employee shall be reinstated, without right of appeal, to the former position and the salary adjusted to the salary range of the former position at the appropriate step as if the temporary appointment had not occurred.

     E.     Temporary, Provisional or Seasonal Employees. An employee who is assigned to work on a particular project or on a job of limited or definite duration, less than nine hundred ninety-nine hours annually, is a temporary, provisional or seasonal employee. A temporary, provisional or seasonal employee: (1) does not hold regular status; (2) does not serve a probationary period; (3) can be dismissed from city employment at any time without cause, right to appeal, grievance or hearing; and (4) is not entitled to earn, accrue, or participate in any city employee benefit plans, or paid or unpaid leaves, except as required by law.

     F.     Probationary Employees. Probationary employees are employees who are newly hired and subject to a period of six months (one thousand forty hours) probation, which is also referred to as a probationary period.

     The work and conduct of probationary employees will be subject to close scrutiny and evaluation. The probationary period is part of the selection process, and shall be considered to be a working test period during which an employee is required to demonstrate fitness for the appointed position by actual performance of the duties of the position.

     At all times during the probationary period, employment with the city is considered to be at-will and the employment relationship may be terminated at any time for any reason by either party. As such, probationary employees serve at the will of the city and are subject to termination without cause and without the right of appeal or hearing, prior to the expiration of this period.

     A probationary employee shall be evaluated by his or her supervisor at the end of the first three months of the probationary period. The evaluation will include a recommendation as to whether or not the employee should continue with the remaining three months of the probationary period.

     Prior to the end of the six-month (one thousand forty hours) probationary period, the employee’s supervisor will evaluate the employee’s performance. If the supervisor’s evaluation indicates that the employee is performing satisfactorily after his or her six months’ probationary period, or has remedied any noted performance issues, and is continuing to perform satisfactorily, the supervisor shall submit a recommendation to the department of human resources that the employee has successfully completed his or her probationary period and should become a regular employee.

     Copies of all evaluations made at any point during and at the conclusion of the probationary period shall be forwarded to the department head and the human resources department for inclusion in the employee’s personnel file.

     Probationary employees are eligible to be paid for recognized holidays. They will also accrue sick, vacation and floating holiday benefits and six months’ worth of accruals will vest and credit to them only after they have completed their probationary period and are appointed to regular employee status. Absences during the probationary period will be unpaid.

     The probationary period is not subject to extension except when the employee is on military leave, as described herein, or on another type of approved leave in which case the city manager will approve whether or not the period may be extended for the period of such leave.

     Probation Period for Promoted Regular Employees. Regular employees appointed to a new position due to promotion will serve a three-month probationary period, with an interim review at six to eight weeks, unless they served in the position in an acting capacity for at least three months prior to their promotion.

     During this probationary period, the city has the discretion to move the employee back to his or her prior position at will and without right of appeal if it determines that it is in the best interest of the city or if it determines that the employee is unable to satisfactorily perform the new position.

     Transferred or promoted employees, although evaluated according to this policy, remain eligible for all benefits while demonstrating their ability to perform their new jobs.

     G.    FLSA Exempt Status.

     1.     Exempt Personnel, Group A. Certain positions are designated as being exempt from overtime provisions. Such positions are typically those held by managers, directors, high-level administrators, or professionals, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act. These positions shall be identified by resolution. Among other things, positions requiring attendance at numerous extra hour meetings and conferences are designated as Exempt Personnel, Group A.

     2.     Exempt Personnel, Group B. Certain positions are designated as being exempt from overtime provisions. Such positions are typically those held by managers, directors, high-level administrators, or professionals, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act. These positions shall be established by resolution. Among other things, positions requiring attendance at occasional extra hour meetings and conferences are designated as Exempt Personnel, Group B. (Ord. 1319 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1260 § 1, 2013; Ord. 1237 § 2, 2012)

 

IV. COMPENSATION
2.52.400 Basic compensation plan.
     The table of salary ranges for classifications and positions and the salary schedule shall be established by resolution. This table or salary schedule is available and can be obtained from the city’s department of human resources. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.405 Beginning compensation.
     New employees of the city start and are paid the entry level rate allocated to the class of employment for which the employee has been hired and as stated in the job offer. However, upon recommendation of the department director or manager and with the approval of the city manager, such new employee may be offered the job at a higher salary within the salary range for that classification. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.410 Pay periods.
     All employees are paid every two weeks. A pay period is for fourteen consecutive calendar days, beginning on a Saturday and ending on a Friday. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.415 Personnel dates defined.
     A.    Hire Date. An employee’s hire date shall be the first day of employment with the city.

     B.     Review Date. An employee’s review or evaluation date shall be the date of the next regularly scheduled written performance evaluation, or another date as requested by supervisor for purpose of conducting a written performance evaluation.

     C.     Merit Step Increase Eligibility Date. The merit step increase eligibility date for individual employees shall be the date of the next scheduled review for advancement within the salary schedule.

     The city’s compensation system is a merit system. Advancements within the salary schedule are subject to the employee satisfactorily completing the minimum length of service within the current step and receiving a satisfactory performance review. An employee shall be denied a merit step increase by the evaluating supervisor for unsatisfactory performance.

     If step advancement is denied, the evaluating supervisor shall coordinate with their assistant city manager and the director of human resources to design an action plan of limited duration, specifically designed to address the performance deficiencies of the subject employee. Additionally, the action plan shall include a strategy that provides support and training designed to equip the subject employee to overcome their performance deficiencies.

     Following the presentation of the performance evaluation, and the required action plan, the employee may exercise one or both of the following options:

     1.     Write a rebuttal to the performance evaluation, which must be included in his or her personnel file;

     2.     Request that the evaluation and the action plan be reviewed by an assistant city manager that is not in their direct line of supervision.

     This option involves a review of the requirements set by policy, and the documents only, which include the performance evaluation, the action plan, and the employee’s rebuttal. It does not constitute a hearing before the independent assistant city manager.

     If the employee chooses to exercise this option, the human resources director shall assign one of the assistant city managers to independently review the performance evaluation and the action plan. The selected assistant city manager shall determine if the recommended action shall be sustained, modified or revoked. The independent assistant city manager’s determination shall be final.

     During the life of the action plan the employee shall receive monthly performance evaluations until such time as the employee either improves his or her performance sufficient to justify advancement within the salary schedule, or until such time as the action plan expires without the employee achieving the required job proficiencies in which case the employee would be subject to discipline up to and including discharge. If the subject employee qualifies for a merit step increase, the next merit step increase eligibility date shall be based on the date of the last satisfactory performance evaluation.

     D.    Employee merit step increase eligibility and review dates will conform to Sections 2.52.420, 2.52.425, 2.52.450 and other pertinent sections of this chapter. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

2.52.425 Advancement in salary.
     All advancements require the approval of the city manager in order to become effective.

     Advancement to the higher steps shall be granted only as a result of a written evaluation of continued satisfactory performance of the duties of the position held.

     Promotional Advancement. When an employee is promoted to a position with a higher salary range, such employee shall be assigned to Step 1 of the higher classification; provided, however, that if such employee is already being paid at a rate equal to or higher than Step 1, he or she shall be placed in the step of the higher classification as will grant such employee a salary increase of not less than five percent.

     If the percentage difference between the ranges will not grant the promoted employee a minimum of five percent salary increase, the promoted employee shall be granted the next highest step in the new salary range.

     When the effective date of a promotion is within sixty days before an employee’s merit step increase eligibility date, any merit step increase which would have been granted to become effective on that merit step increase date, shall become effective on the effective date of promotion and shall be in addition to the promotional increase. (Ord. 1112 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.430 Adjustment in salary—Reclassification.
     The salary of an employee in a position which is reclassified, shall be determined as follows:

     A.    Same Range. If the position is reclassified to a class that is allocated to the same salary range, the salary shall not change.

     B.     Higher Range. If the position is reclassified to a class which is allocated to a higher salary range, such employee shall be assigned to Step 1 of the higher classification; provided, however, that if such employee is already being paid at a rate equal to or higher than Step 1, he or she shall be placed in the step of the higher classification that will grant such employee a salary increase of not less than five percent.

     When the effective date of a reclassification is within sixty days before an employee’s merit step increase eligibility date, any merit step increase which would have been granted on that merit step increase eligibility date shall become effective on the effective date of the reclassification and shall be in addition to the reclassification increase.

     C.     Lower Range Y-rating. If a position is reclassified to a class that is allocated to a lower salary range, the position shall be Y-rated.

     The salary of a Y-rated position will remain at the rate of pay received immediately before the reclassification until a step in the new (lower) salary range assigned to the reclassified position equals or exceeds the employee’s rate of pay. Step advancements in the new (lower) range may be made without increases to the employee’s rate of pay.

     COLA (cost-of-living adjustment) increase will not be given to Y-rated employees until the employee’s step in the new (lower) salary range equals or exceeds the employee’s rate of pay. (Ord. 1112 § 3, 2006; Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.435 Reduction in salary.
     In the event the city determines it necessary to reduce salaries because of budgetary limitations or business necessity and through no fault of the employee, the salaries of one and/or all employees may be reduced.

     If this process is undertaken, the city manager shall notify all employees in writing and will hold employee meetings to explain the business necessity of this action. The city will also notify the employee representative group pursuant to existing memorandums of understanding and collective bargaining procedures.

     The city may restore employee’s salaries to the prior levels if and when budgetary or business conditions sufficiently improve. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

     If this process is undertaken, the city manager shall notify the employee or affected employees in writing of the intended action, with reasons, at least thirty calendar days, before the effective date of layoff. A copy of such notice shall be given to the employee organization that is affected, so the city and the employee organization can fulfill their obligation under MMB to meet and confer over the effects of the layoffs.

     Seniority within the classification shall determine the order of layoff. The employee will be given priority based upon tenure with the city, for a period not to exceed twelve months, for re-employment, provided there is a vacancy and the employee is qualified and otherwise suited for the position.

     The city will also notify the employee representative group pursuant to existing memorandums of understanding and collective bargaining procedures. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.445 Reduction in salary for unsatisfactory performance or demotion.
     A.    Unsatisfactory Performance. When an employee is demoted for reasons of unsatisfactory performance or disciplinary action or has his or her job duties and/or responsibilities reduced, the employee’s salary shall be reduced to fit within a lower salary range.

     The employee’s merit step increase eligibility date shall be one year from the effective date of demotion, unless this date is changed by the city manager at the supervisor’s request.

     B.     Other Type of Demotion. When an employee is demoted to a position with a lower salary range of pay for reasons other than unsatisfactory performance or disciplinary action, the employee shall remain at the rate of pay received immediately before the demotion until the employee is eligible for a merit step increase and a satisfactory written evaluation is received. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.450 Merit step increase eligibility.
     The merit step increase eligibility date shall be the date an employee is next eligible for advancement within the salary schedule in accordance with Section 2.52.420 of this article.

     An employee shall be denied a merit step increase by the evaluating supervisor for unsatisfactory performance.

     Advancements within the salary schedule are subject to the employee satisfactorily completing the minimum length of active service within the current step, except those employees advanced due to reclassification.

     The merit step increase eligibility date and review date will conform to this section. For purposes of merit step increases within the salary range, the merit step increase eligibility date and performance review date shall be the date of:

     A.    Promotional Advancement. The merit step increase eligibility date shall be changed to the anniversary date of the promotion.

     B.     Range Change and Reclassification. The merit step increase eligibility date shall change to the anniversary of the employee’s reclassification date and conform to Section 2.52.420 of this article.

V. WORKPLACE POLICIES
2.52.500 Americans with Disabilities Act policy and procedure.
     To comply with applicable laws ensuring equal employment opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities, the city will make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, who is an applicant or an employee, unless undue hardship would result, or unless the individual poses a direct threat to the health and safety of him or herself or others.

     Any applicant or employee who requires an accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of the job should contact the human resources director and request such an accommodation. The individual with the disability should specify what accommodation he or she needs to perform the job.

     Requests for an accommodation will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the city may require reasonable documentation of a disability to support the request, including, but not limited to, a fitness for duty report.

 

     The city will engage in a good faith interactive process to identify the barriers that make it difficult for the applicant or employee to have an equal opportunity to perform his or her job. The city will identify possible accommodations, if any, that will help eliminate the limitation. If the accommodation is reasonable, will not impose an undue hardship on city operations, and does not pose a direct threat to the health and safety of the individual or others, the city will make the accommodation. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.505 Employee responsibilities and standards of conduct.

     Any questions about this policy should be directed to the department of human resources. (Ord. 1241 § 8, 2012; Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.510 Policy and complaint procedure against harassment, discrimination and retaliation.
     A.    Purpose. The purpose of this Policy is to: establish a strong commitment to prohibit and prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in employment; to define those terms; and to set forth a procedure for investigating and resolving internal complaints. The employer encourages all covered individuals to report, as soon as possible, any conduct that is believed to violate this Policy.

     B.     Policy. The employer has zero tolerance for any conduct that violates this Policy. Conduct need not arise to the level of a violation of law to violate this Policy. Instead a single act can violate this Policy and provide grounds for discipline or other appropriate sanctions.

     Harassment or discrimination against an applicant, unpaid intern, volunteer or employee by a supervisor, management employee, elected or appointed official, co-worker, member of the public, or contractor on the basis of race, religion, sex (including gender, gender identity, gender expression, transgender, pregnancy, and breastfeeding), national origin, ancestry, disability, medical condition, genetic characteristics or information, marital status, age, sexual orientation (including homosexuality, bisexuality, or heterosexuality), or any other protected classification as defined below, will not be tolerated.

     This Policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, placement, promotion, disciplinary action, layoff, recall, transfer, leave of absence, compensation, and training.

     Disciplinary action or other appropriate sanction up to and including termination will be instituted for prohibited behavior as defined below.

     Any retaliation against a person for filing a complaint or participating in the complaint resolution process is prohibited. Individuals found to be retaliating in violation of this Policy will be subject to appropriate sanction or disciplinary action up to and including termination.

     C.     Definitions.

     1.     Protected Classifications. This Policy prohibits harassment or discrimination because of an individual’s protected classification. “Protected classification” includes race, religion, color, sex (including gender, gender identity, gender expression, transgender, pregnancy, and breastfeeding), sexual orientation (including heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality), national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, marital status, pregnancy, age, medical condition, genetic characteristics or information, military and veteran status, and physical or mental disability.

     2.     Policy Coverage. This Policy prohibits the employer, elected or appointed officials, officers, employees, or contractors from harassing or discriminating against applicants, officers, officials, employees, unpaid interns, volunteers, or contractors because of: (a) an individual’s protected classification; (b) the perception that an individual has a protected classification; or (c) the individual associates with a person who has or is perceived to have a protected classification.

     3.     Discrimination. This Policy prohibits treating individuals differently because of the individual’s protected classification as defined in this Policy.

     4.     Harassment may include, but is not limited to, the following types of behavior that is taken because of a person’s protected classification. Note that harassment is not limited to conduct that employer’s employees take. Under certain circumstances, harassment can also include conduct taken by those who are not employees, such as elected officials, appointed officials, persons providing services under contracts, or even members of the public:

     a.     Speech, such as epithets, derogatory comments or slurs, and propositioning on the basis of a protected classification. This might include inappropriate comments on appearance, including dress or physical features, or dress consistent with gender identification, or race-oriented stories or jokes.

     b.     Physical acts, such as assault, impeding or blocking movement, offensive touching, or any physical interference with normal work or movement. This includes pinching, grabbing, patting, propositioning, leering, or making explicit or implied job threats or promises in return for submission to physical acts.

     c.     Visual acts, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, emails, pictures, or drawings related to a protected classification.

     d.     Unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other acts of a sexual nature, where submission is made a term or condition of employment, where submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions, or where the conduct is intended to or actually does unreasonably interfere with an individual’s work performance or create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

     5.     Guidelines for Identifying Harassment. To help clarify what constitutes harassment in violation of this Policy, use the following guidelines:

     a.     Harassment includes any conduct which would be “unwelcome” to an individual of the recipient’s same protected classification and which is taken because of the recipient’s protected classification.

     b.     It is no defense that the recipient appears to have voluntarily “consented” to the conduct as issue. A recipient may not protest for many legitimate reasons, including the need to avoid being insubordinate or to avoid being ostracized.

     c.     Simply because no one has complained about a joke, gesture, picture, physical contact, or comment does not mean that the conduct is welcome. Harassment can evolve over time. The fact that no one is complaining now does not preclude anyone from complaining if the conduct is repeated in the future.

     d.     Even visual, verbal, or physical conduct between two employees who appear to welcome the conduct can constitute harassment of a third applicant, officer, official, employee, or contractor who observes the conduct or learns about the conduct later. Conduct can constitute harassment even if it is not explicitly or specifically directed at an individual.

     e.     Conduct can constitute harassment in violation of this Policy even if the individual engaging in the conduct has no intention to harass. Even well-intentioned conduct can violate this Policy if the conduct is directed at, or implicates a protected classification, and if an individual of the recipient’s same protected classification would find it offensive (e.g., gifts, over attentions, endearing nicknames).

     6.     Retaliation. Any adverse conduct taken because an applicant, employee, or contractor has reported harassment or discrimination, or has participated in the complaint and investigation process described herein, is prohibited. “Adverse conduct” includes but is not limited to: taking sides because an individual has reported harassment or discrimination, spreading rumors about a complaint, shunning and avoiding an individual who reports harassment or discrimination, or real or implied threats of intimidation to prevent an individual from reporting harassment or discrimination. The following individuals are protected from retaliation: those who make good faith reports of harassment or discrimination, and those who associate with an individual who is involved in reporting harassment or discrimination or who participates in the compliant or investigation process.

     D.    Complaint Procedure.

     1.     An employee, job applicant, unpaid intern, volunteer, or contractor who believes he or she has been harassed may make a complaint verbally or in writing with any of the following. There is no need to follow the chain of command:

     a.     Immediate supervisor;

     b.     Any supervisor or manager within or outside of the department;

     c.     Department head;

     d.     Director of human resources; or

     e.     Confidential employee reporting hotline.

     2.     Any supervisor or department head who receives a harassment complaint should notify the director of human resources immediately.

     3.     Upon receiving notification of a harassment complaint, the director of human resources shall:

     a.     Authorize and supervise the investigation of the complaint and/or investigate the complaint. The investigation will include interviews with: (i) the complainant; (ii) the accused harasser; and (iii) other persons who have relevant knowledge concerning the allegations in the complaint.

     b.     Review the factual information gathered through the investigation to determine whether the alleged conduct constitutes harassment, discrimination, or retaliation giving consideration to all factual information, the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the conduct, and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred.

     c.     Report a summary of the determination as to whether harassment occurred to appropriate persons, including the complainant, the alleged harasser, the supervisor, and the department head. If the discipline is imposed, the level of discipline will not be communicated to the complainant.

     d.     If conduct in violation of this Policy occurred, take or recommend to the appointing authority prompt and effective remedial action. The remedial action will be commensurate with the severity of the offense.

     e.     Take reasonable steps to protect the complainant from further harassment, discrimination, or retaliation.

     f.      Take reasonable steps to protect the complainant from retaliation as a result of communicating the complaint.

     4.     The employer takes a proactive approach to potential Policy violations and will conduct an investigation if its officers, supervisors, or managers become aware that harassment, discrimination, or retaliation may be occurring, regardless of whether the recipient or third party reports a potential violation.

     5.     Option to Report to Outside Administrative Agencies. An individual has the option to report harassment, discrimination, or retaliation to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). These administrative agencies offer legal remedies and a complaint process. The nearest offices are listed in the government section of the telephone book or employees can check the posters that are located on employer bulletin boards for office locations and telephone numbers.

     E.     Confidentiality. Every possible effort will be made to assure the confidentiality of complaints made under this Policy. Complete confidentiality cannot occur, however, due to the need to fully investigate and the duty to take effective remedial action. As a result, confidentiality will be maintained to the extent possible. An individual who is interviewed during the course of an investigation is prohibited from discussing the substance of the interview, except as otherwise directed by a supervisor or the human resources director. Any individual who discusses the content of an investigatory interview will be subject to discipline or other appropriate sanction. The employer will not disclose a completed investigation report except as it deems necessary to support a disciplinary action, to take remedial action, to defend itself in adversarial proceedings, or to comply with the law or court order.

     F.     Responsibilities. Managers and supervisors are responsible for:

     1.     Informing employees of this Policy.

     2.     Modeling appropriate behavior.

     3.     Taking all steps necessary to prevent harassment, discrimination, or retaliation from occurring.

     4.     Receiving complaints in a fair and serious manner, and documenting steps taken to resolve complaints.

     5.     Monitoring the work environment and taking immediate appropriate action to stop potential violations, such as removing inappropriate pictures or correcting inappropriate language.

     10.   Implementing appropriate disciplinary and remedial actions.

     11.   Reporting potential violations of this Policy of which he or she becomes aware, regardless of whether a complaint has been submitted, to the human resources department of the department head.

     12.   Participating in periodic training and scheduling employees for training.

     Each employee or contractor is responsible for:

     1.     Treating all employees and contractors with respect and consideration.

     2.     Modeling appropriate behavior.

     3.     Participating in periodic training.

2.52.515 Policy against violence in the workplace.
     The city maintains zero tolerance against violence in the workplace.

     Acts or threats of physical violence, including intimidation, harassment, and/or coercion, that involve or affect the city or that occur on city property or in the conduct of city business off city property, will not be tolerated. This prohibition against threats and acts of violence applies to all persons involved in city operations, including, but not limited to, city personnel, contract workers, temporary employees, and anyone else on city property or conducting city business off city property. Violations of this policy, by any individual, will lead to disciplinary action, up to and possibly including immediate discharge, and/or legal action as appropriate.

     Workplace violence is any intentional conduct that is sufficiently severe, offensive, or intimidating to cause an individual to reasonably fear for his or her personal safety or the safety of his or her family, friends, and/or property such that employment conditions are altered or a hostile, abusive, or intimidating work environment is created for one or several city employees. Workplace violence may involve any threats or acts of violence occurring on city premises, regardless of the relationship between the city and the parties involved in the incident. It may also include threats or acts of violence that affect the business interests of the city or that may lead to an incident of violence on city premises.

     Threats or acts of violence occurring off city premises that involve employees, agents, or individuals acting as a representative of the city, whether as victims of or active participants in the conduct, and that have a nexus to city employment may also constitute workplace violence.

     Specific examples of conduct that may constitute threats or acts of violence under this policy include, but are not limited to, the following:

     A.    Threats or acts of physical or aggressive contact directed toward another individual;

     B.     Threats or acts of physical harm directed toward an individual or his or her family, friends or associates;

     C.     The intentional destruction or threat of destruction of city property or another employee’s property;

     D.    Harassing or threatening phone calls;

     E.     Surveillance;

     F.     Stalking;

     G.    Possession of offensive or defensive weapons;

     H.    Veiled threats of physical harm or similar intimidation;

     I.      Any conduct relating to violence or threats of violence that adversely affects the city’s legitimate business interests.

     Workplace violence does not refer to occasional comments of a socially acceptable nature. These comments may include references to legitimate sporting activities, popular entertainment, or current events. Rather, it refers to behavior that is personally offensive, threatening, or intimidating.

     A.    Reporting. Employees are encouraged to report valid claims without fear of retaliation of any kind. Employees will not be subject to retaliation for registering any complaint of violence in good faith.

     Employees are required to immediately report threatening comments, action or violent behavior at any city location or at any location where the City conducts business to the department of human resources for monitoring and assessment.

     Department heads or supervisors will report all incidents of violence or possible violence, including perceived threats, to the department of human resources. The department will promptly assess the situation and determine the most appropriate course of action, including the undertaking of an investigation to confirm the occurrence reported.

     B.     Investigation. Any person who engages in a threatening or violent action on city property may be removed from the premises as quickly as safety permits and may be required, at the city’s discretion, to remain off city premises pending the outcome of an investigation of the incident.

     When threats are made or acts of violence are committed by employees, a judgment will be made by the city as to what actions are appropriate, including possible medical evaluation and/or possible disciplinary action.

     Employees who engage in threats or violence, direct, indirect, implied, or actual, against co-workers or any other person concerning city business, may be subject to legal action by law enforcement authorities as well as disciplinary action by the city, up to and including termination of employment.

     Once a threat has been substantiated, it is the city’s policy to put the threat maker on notice that he/she will be held accountable for his or her actions and then implement a decisive and appropriate response. The human resources director will document such incidents. Such documentation will include a narrative of the incident including names and other appropriate identification of the parties involved, verbal comments made or descriptions of the violent behavior, witness names, and witnesses’ statements.

     Under this policy, the city will act to prevent a threat from being carried out, a violent act from occurring, or a life-threatening situation from developing. No existing policy or procedure of the city should be interpreted in a manner that prevents the making of these necessary actions. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.520 Policy against substance abuse.
     The city maintains a zero-tolerance policy for substance abuse and its effects in the workplace as even involvement with drugs and alcohol off the job can take its toll on job performance and employee safety.

     The city’s concern is that employees are in a condition to perform their duties safely and efficiently, in the interest of their co-workers and the public, as well as themselves. The presence of illegal drugs and alcohol on the job, and the influence of these substances during work hours, are inconsistent with this objective. Therefore the City has adopted a zero-tolerance policy regarding drug and alcohol use/abuse. The city will include drug-free awareness information in its programs.

     This policy is also intended to comply with all applicable federal regulations and state laws governing workplace anti-drug programs, including the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, and similarly, the California Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1990, which require the establishment of drug-free workplace policies and the reporting of certain drug-related offenses to the federal Department of Transportation.

     Any questions regarding rights and obligations under this policy shall be referred to the employee’s supervisor, department head, or to the human resources director.

     A.    Personnel Affected. This policy’s prohibition against substance abuse in the workplace applies to all city employees when they are on city property or when performing city related business. All employees who are found to have violated this policy are subject to discipline, up to and including termination.

     B.     Pre-Employment Testing. In an effort to reach the goal of a drug and alcohol free workplace, the city will conduct pre-employment drug and alcohol testing of applicants for all city positions. Pre-employment drug and alcohol tests shall apply only to non-city applicants following a conditional offer of employment. City employees who apply for another position shall not be subject to pre-employment drug or alcohol tests. Any applicant who refuses to provide consent for pre-employment testing under this policy will be disqualified from city employment.

     Drug and alcohol testing will be conducted by a qualified third party. Any medical history and other information provided by the applicant, as well as the results of the tests, shall not be revealed to the city. Rather, the city shall be notified as to whether or not the applicant’s tests revealed any prohibited substances.

     An applicant whose test is positive for prohibited substances (alcohol or illegal drugs/non-prescribed controlled substances) is entitled to question and challenge test results he or she believes to be erroneous. Any positive test shall be retested independently using a more sensitive test.

     The city will not hire applicants whose test results are positive for prohibited substances. Applicants whose test results indicate abuse of lawfully prescribed drugs, likewise, will not by hired by the city. Any applicant who tests positive for substance abuse shall not be hired by the city, and shall not be eligible for employment with the city for a period of one year.

     C.     Reasonable Suspicion Testing and Search. For individuals currently employed by the city, the city may require a blood test, urinalysis, or other drug and/or alcohol screening of those persons reasonably suspected of using or being under the influence of a drug or alcohol at work or when on standby duty. Testing must be approved by the director of human resources, his or her designee, or a department head.

     Reasonable suspicion is defined as behavior, speech, body odor, appearance, or other objective evidence (for example, an open container in a vehicle) of recent drug or alcohol use, which would lead a reasonable person to believe that the employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. Testing may also be required following a work-related accident or mishap. The supervisor shall document those factors that created the reasonable suspicion. An employee’s consent to submit to such a test is required as a condition of employment and the employee’s refusal to consent may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination for even a first refusal or any subsequent refusal.

     D.    Prescribed Medications. While use of medically prescribed medications and drugs is not per se a violation of this policy, failure by the employee to notify his or her supervisor before beginning work when taking medications or drugs which could foreseeable interfere with the safe and effective performance of duties or operation of city equipment will result in discipline, up to and including termination. Failure to submit the said documentation may result in the employee being placed on leave until such time as the employee provides such documentation. In the event there is a question regarding an employee’s ability to perform safely and effectively assigned duties while using such medications or drugs, clearance from a qualified physician may be required.

     E.     No Expectation of Privacy. The city hereby serves notice that employees do not have an expectation of privacy with respect to city property, including but not limited to lockers, storage areas, furniture, city vehicles, and other places under the common control of the city and employees. The city, therefore, has the right to search all such areas and property in which the city maintains control or joint control with the employee. The city may notify the appropriate law enforcement agency that an employee may have illegal drugs in his or her possession, or in an area not jointly or fully controlled by the city.

     An employee reasonably believed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs shall be prevented from engaging in further work and may be detained for a reasonable time until he/she can be safely transported from the worksite.

     F.     Confidentiality. Any reports or test results generated under this policy shall not appear in an employee’s general personnel folder but will be kept in a separate, confidential medical file that will be securely maintained by the director of human resources. The report or test results may be disclosed to city management on a strictly need-to-know basis and to the tested employee upon request. Disclosure without employee consent may also occur in the following situations: (1) the release of the information is compelled by law or judicial/administrative process, (2) the information has been placed at issue in a formal dispute between the city and the employee or applicant, (3) the information is to be used in administering an employee benefit plan, (4) the information is needed by medical personnel for the diagnosis or treatment of an employee or  applicant who is unable to authorize disclosure, or (5), when the information is requested by the department of transportation or any state or local official with regulatory authority over the city or any of its safety-sensitive employees.

     G.    Return to Duty Testing. An employee who has violated this policy but has not been terminated from city employment may be subject to a return-to-duty test and up to six unannounced drug and/or alcohol tests during the first twelve months back to duty.

     H.    Employee Responsibility and Conditions of Employment. An employee of the city, being made fully aware of the city’s zero-tolerance policy with respect to drug and alcohol use, must:

     1.     Not report to work or be on standby or on-call status while his or her ability to perform job duties is impaired due to on or off-duty alcohol or drug use;

     2.     Not possess or use controlled substances (illegal drugs or prescription drugs without a prescription) at any time, or use alcohol at any time while on city property or while on duty for the city at any location;

     3.     Not directly or through a third party manufacture, sell, distribute, dispense, or provide controlled substances to any person, including any employee, at any time; or manufacture, sell, distribute, dispense or provide alcohol to any employee while either or both are on duty;

     4.     Notify his or her supervisor, before beginning work, when taking any medications or drugs, prescription or nonprescription, which may interfere with the safe and effective performance of duties or operation of city equipment;

     5.     In accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, notify the human resources director of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such conviction. Within thirty days of the date the city learns of an employee’s conviction, the employee will be disciplined, up to and including termination. Any employee not terminated will be required to satisfactorily participate in and complete a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program. Any employee who fails to provide the notice described here will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination;

     6.     Notify the human resources director immediately of facts or reasonable suspicions when he or she observes behavior or other evidence that a fellow employee poses a risk to the health and safety of the employee or others;

     7.     Consent to any and all reasonable suspicion tests and/or searches. Failure to comply with reasonable suspicion tests will be considered a violation of this policy and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including, termination.

     I.      Management Responsibilities and Guidelines.

     1.     Department heads and supervisors are responsible for reasonable enforcement of this policy.

     2.     A department head or supervisor may search the personal possessions of employees only when there is a reasonable suspicion of a violation of this policy and only with the consent of, and in the presence of, the employee and human resources director.

     3.     Department heads and supervisors shall notify the human resources director when they have reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee may have illegal drugs in his or her possession, or in an area jointly or fully controlled by the city. If a department head and human resources director, or his or her designee, concur that there is reasonable suspicion of illegal drug possession, the department head or human resources director shall notify the appropriate law enforcement agency.

     J.      Employee Assistance Program. The city maintains an employee assistance program (EAP) that provides assistance to employees who suffer from alcoholism, drug problems, or other personal or emotional problems. Employees who require assistance should contact the city’s EAP provider immediately. The city will provide reasonable accommodation to those employees who are recovering from alcohol or drug abuse problems to the extent that they are disabled as defined under either the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Fair Employment and Housing Act.

     It is the responsibility of each employee to seek the necessary assistance before alcohol, drug or other problems adversely affect the employee’s performance or conduct. If a violation of city policy or rules occurs, a subsequent attempt to seek and obtain assistance on a voluntary basis will not prevent or lessen the severity of the disciplinary action. Employees may request an unpaid leave of absence to enroll in a voluntary drug or alcohol rehabilitation program if they wish to do so. The city will review such requests on a case-by-case basis.

     An employee’s decision to seek assistance will not be used as a basis for disciplinary action and will not be used against the employee in any disciplinary proceeding. On the other hand, as noted above, the mere fact that an employee has sought or intends to seek professional assistance will not be a defense to the imposition of disciplinary action where the employer determines, in its sole discretion, that disciplinary action is warranted. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.525 Anti-retaliation policy.
     The city is committed to prohibiting retaliation against those who report, oppose, or participate in the investigation of alleged wrongdoing in the workplace.

     A.    Protected Activity. This policy protects those who engage in protected activity from being retaliated against because of that protected activity. Protected activity includes any of the following:

     1.     Filing a complaint with a federal or state enforcement or administrative agency;

     2.     Participating in or cooperating with a federal or state enforcement agency that is conducting an investigation of the city regarding alleged unlawful activity;

     3.     Testifying as a party, witness, or accused regarding alleged unlawful activity;

     4.     Associating with another employee who is engaged in any of the protected activities enumerated in this subsection;

     5.     Making or filing an internal complaint with the city regarding alleged unlawful activity;

     6.     Providing informal notice to the city regarding alleged unlawful activity.

     B.     Policy Coverage. This policy prohibits city officials, officers, employees, vendors or contractors from retaliating against applicants, officers, officials, employees, or contractors because of any of the protected activity as defined in subsection A of this section.

     C.     Adverse Action. This policy prohibits any adverse conduct that is taken because an applicant, employee, vendor or contractor has engaged in any of the forms of protected activity as defined in subsection A of this section. Adverse action includes any of the following:

     1.     Taking sides because an individual has reported alleged wrongdoing;

     2.     Spreading rumors about a complaint of alleged wrongdoing;

     3.     Shunning or avoiding an individual who has engaged in any of the forms of protected activity described in subsection A of this section;

     4.     Real or implied threats of intimidation to attempt to prevent an individual from reporting alleged wrongdoing or because of protected activity;

     5.     Refusing to hire an individual because of protected activity;

     6.     Denying promotion to an individual because of protected activity;

     7.     Taking any form of disciplinary action because of protected activity;

     8.     Issuing a poor evaluation because of protected activity;

     9.     Extending a probationary period because of protected activity;

     10.   Altering work schedules or work assignments because of protected activity.

     D.    Causal Connection. This policy prohibits adverse action that is taken because of an individual’s protected activity.

     This policy does not prohibit adverse action that is taken for legitimate or non-discriminatory reasons, such as: discipline for legal cause or refusing to hire because of inadequate qualifications. As a result, adverse action is only prohibited if it is causally connected to, or taken because of, the alleged protected activity.

     E.     Complaint Procedure. An applicant, employee, officer, official, or contractor who feels he or she has been retaliated against in violation of this policy should immediately report the conduct according to the following procedure so that the complaint can be resolved fairly and quickly.

     1.     Reporting to Management. The individual may make a complaint to any supervisor, department head, city manager, or a member of the human resources department. The complaint should be in writing and provide all details of the incident or incidents, names of individuals involved, and the names of any witnesses. The complaint should contain a statement that the individual swears that the contents of the complaint are true, or that the individual believes them to be true. The complaint shall be filed as soon as possible after either the alleged act of retaliation, or the date the individual first becomes aware of alleged retaliation, but no later than three months thereafter.

     2.     Interim Relief. Any official, officer, supervisor or management employee who receives a complaint or learns of a potential violation of this policy against retaliation must promptly report the information to the human resources director, or another in the chain of command, and if necessary, take action to diffuse volatile circumstances.

     3.     Investigation. The human resources director or his or her designee will immediately undertake an effective, discrete, thorough and objective investigation of the allegations at issue. Each complaint that complies with the requirements stated in this policy will be investigated to the extent that the city deems appropriate. The investigation may include interviews with the reporting individual, the accused, and any other person who is believed to have relevant knowledge concerning the allegations. The investigator will remind all witnesses to maintain the confidentiality of the content of the interview, and that retaliation against those who report alleged wrongdoing or who participate in the complaint procedure is prohibited.

     F.     Remedial and Disciplinary Action. If the investigation concludes that a violation of this policy against retaliation has occurred, the city will notify the offended and
offending parties of the general conclusion(s) of the investigation and will take effective remedial action that is designed to end the violation(s).

     Any employee or officer determined to be responsible for violating this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Disciplinary action may also be taken against any official, supervisor or manager who condones or ignores potential violations of this policy or otherwise fails to take appropriate action to enforce this policy. Any official or contractor who is found to have violated this policy will be subject to appropriate sanctions.

     G.    Requirement to Exhaust Administrative Remedies. This policy provides an administrative remedy that individuals must use prior to resorting to judicial remedies to address the conduct described in this section.

     H.    Option to Report to Outside Administrative Agencies. Applicants, employees, officers, officials, vendors and contractors have the option to report alleged retaliation for reporting harassment or discrimination on the basis of sex, race, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, religion, or medical condition to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). These governmental agencies offer legal remedies and a complaint process. The nearest DFEH and EEOC offices are listed in the government section of the telephone book or employees can check the equal employment opportunity posters that are located on city bulletin boards for office locations and telephone numbers.

     I.      Individual Employee/ Contractor. A city employee or contractor is required to:

     1.     Conduct him or herself consistently with this policy;

     2.     Report any act he or she believes in good faith constitutes retaliation as defined here, to his or her immediate supervisor or department head or to the human resources director;

     3.     Maintain the confidentiality of any investigation the city conducts under this policy by not disclosing the substance of any investigatory interview, except as directed by the department head or the human resources director;

     4.     Cooperate fully with the city’s investigation into alleged violations of this policy, by responding fully and truthfully to all questions posed during the investigation.

     J.      Management and Supervisory Employees (including Officers and Officials). In addition to the responsibilities listed in subsection I of this section for individual employees, management and supervisory personnel (including officers and officials) are responsible to help enforce this policy within their departments or areas of responsibility by:

     1.     Being familiar with this policy and modeling behavior that is consistent with it;

     2.     Informing all employees under their direction of this policy and providing training as appropriate;

     3.     Receiving complaints in a fair and serious manner, documenting steps taken to resolve the problem, and following up with the complaining employee to ensure that the behavior has stopped and that there have been no reprisals;

     5.     Based on the findings of the investigation, implementing appropriate disciplinary and remedial action;

     6.     Informing one who complains of alleged harassment, discrimination or retaliation in violation of the city’s policy against harassment, discrimination or retaliation of his or her option to contact the EEOC or DFEH;

     7.     Regularly monitoring the work environment and taking immediate appropriate action to stop potential violations.

     K.    Human Resources Department. The human resources department is responsible for administering the complaint procedure, authorizing and/or conducting an investigation and, in consultation with the department head, recommending disciplinary action commensurate with the severity of the offense, and recommending other appropriate remedial action. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.530 Attendance policy.
     The city requires employees to report for work punctually and to work all scheduled hours and any required overtime. Excessive tardiness and poor attendance disrupt workflow and customer service and will not be tolerated.

     To address this concern management has instituted the following criteria and guidelines for employees:

     A.    Supervisors should track employees starting, ending, and break times. Employees are expected to be engaged in carrying out their duties during all scheduled work time and should be ready to begin working at their scheduled starting time.

     B.     Supervisors should track all absences and, for nonexempt employees (those subject to the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act), any tardiness or early departure exceeding ten minutes.

 

     C.     Employees should notify their supervisor, as far in advance as possible whenever they are unable to report for work, when they know they will be late, or when they must leave early.

     D.    Employees will be compensated during authorized absences in accordance with the policies contained in city’s policies, including sick leave, vacation, short-term absence, and leaves of absence. Nonexempt employees will not receive compensation for time missed because of tardiness or early departure if the time missed exceeds ten minutes after starting time or before quitting time. Failure to notify the appropriate supervisor properly of any absence may result in loss of compensation during the absence and may be grounds for disciplinary action.

     E.     Nonexempt employees who are delayed in reporting for work more than thirty minutes and who have not notified their supervisor of their expected tardiness, may be subject to disciplinary action.

     F.     Employees who report for work without proper equipment or in improper attire may be subject to disciplinary action.

     G.    Employees who report for work in a condition considered not fit for work may be subject to disciplinary action.

     H.    Nonexempt employees who are unable to report because of natural disaster or inclement weather conditions will be granted an authorized unpaid absence but employees may use their available vacation accruals to convert this into a paid absence.

     I.      Nonexempt employees will not be required or permitted to work any period of time before or after scheduled starting or quitting times for the purpose of making up time lost because of tardiness, unauthorized absence, authorized absence, or any other reason if the result will be that the employee works more than 40 hours during the workweek.

     J.      When appropriate, supervisors should counsel employees under their supervision on the importance of good attendance and warn that excessive tardiness or absences will lead to discipline, up to and including termination.

     K.    Employees must obtain permission from their supervisor in order to leave city premises during working hours. In addition, employees who are frequently away from the premises for business reasons should inform their supervisors of their whereabouts during working hours.

     L.     Unauthorized or excessive absences or tardiness may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

     M.    Employees who are absent from work for three consecutive days without giving proper notice to their supervisors will be considered as having voluntarily quit. At that time, the city may formally pursue termination and advise the employee of the planned action by certified mail to the employee’s last known address. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.535 Anti-nepotism policy.
     The city does not have a prohibition against hiring relatives of current employees, but does reserve the right to weigh the circumstances of situations as they arise on a case-by-case basis to determine if the employment of a candidate for employment or the continued employment of a current employee would violate this policy. In keeping with this policy, relatives will not be hired into or transferred from, positions where they would be directly or indirectly supervised by a relative.

     “Relative” means and includes mother, father, sister, brother, spouse, domestic partner, daughter, son, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, grandmother, grandfather, granddaughter, grandson, aunt, uncle, first cousin, nieces, and nephews.

     A.    Applicants. An applicant for a position who has a relative employed by the city may not be denied the right to file an application for employment and compete in the examination process.

     Following employment examinations or interviews, if the applicant is successfully certified as eligible, he or she may be employed in a department, division, or office in which a member of his or her immediate family is employed. However, such employment shall be denied if the human resources department determines that such employment would potentially create a conflict of interest or violate the supervisory prohibition described in this section or have a potential adverse impact on supervision, safety, security, or employee morale.

     Refusal of appointment of an eligible candidate by virtue of this policy, does not affect the candidates eligibility for other positions that may become available.

     In no case may an employee participate directly or indirectly in the recruitment or selection process for a position for which the employee’s relative has filed an employment application.

     B.     Current Employees. Where two relatives are working in the same department, division, or office at the time this policy is adopted, the relationship shall not be deemed a violation of this policy unless the employee’s mutual employment creates a potential conflict of interest or has a potentially adverse impact on supervision, safety, security, or employee morale.

     If, a familial relationship exists or is established through marriage resulting in a spousal or in-law relationship, the employee may continue in their positions so long as the terms of this policy are not violated. If, in the determination of the department manager, such a relationship creates a potential violation of this policy, he or she shall submit the reasons for his or her determination to the director of human resources for review.

     The director of human resources shall then investigate the findings and determine if this policy has been violated. The director of human resources shall submit his or her results to the department manager with a copy to the city manager. If a policy violation has occurred, the human resources director and the department manager shall then promptly inform the employees of the city’s intention to transfer one of the employees to a vacant position of comparable pay and duties in another city division or office, provided that such a vacant position exists, the transferee is qualified, and no offer of employment to fill the vacant position has been made to another eligible candidate.

     If a position of comparable pay and duties is not open, but one in a lower classification is vacant, either of the employees may elect to voluntarily demote to the lower position, provided that the vacant position is in another department, division, or office, the employee is qualified to fill the position, and the position has not been offered to another candidate. A voluntary demotion undertaken at the behest of the affected employee under this provision shall be in accordance with the provisions set forth in the city’s pertinent policies.

     If a transfer or voluntary demotion is not feasible, the affected employees shall decide which of them will resign from city employment. If the employees do not make a decision, the director of human resources will make a decision that is in the best interest of the city. One employee will continue in city employment and the other will be separated in good standing.

     C.     Review. With the exception of the director of human resources review, any decision to transfer, voluntarily demote, or resign pursuant to this policy is not subject to any appeal or grievance procedures. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.540 Outside employment policy.
     This policy establishes guidelines for outside employment or activity. Outside employment or activity by a city employee must not be inconsistent with, incompatible with, or in conflict with his or her duties or the duties, functions or responsibilities of the city.

     A request to engage in outside employment or activities must be made in writing to a supervisor or department director. The supervisor or department director will not approve an application for any outside employment or activity if the contemplated outside employment or activity involves any of the following:

     A.    The use of city time, facilities, equipment, supplies or other resources;

     B.     The use of the employee’s uniform, badge, prestige or influence of his or her city office or employment;

     C.     The acceptance by the employee of money or other consideration, from anyone other than the city, for any act that the employee regularly performs in the regular course or hours of his or her city employment as part of his or her duties for the city;

     D.    The performance of an act, not in his or her capacity as a city employee, which may later be subject directly or indirectly to the control, inspection, review, audit, or enforcement by the employee or the city department in which he or she is employed.

     A request to engage in outside employment or activities must include the time frame during which the employment or activities will occur. If the request is approved, it is approved for the duration stated and the work described in the request only, but it may be renewed with subsequent approval. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.545 Conflicts of interest.
     An employee or former employee or former city official shall not engage in any other employment or activities which in any way create a conflict of interest or even the appearance of impropriety.

     Former Officials or Employees. It shall be improper for any former employee or former city official to appear as a compensated representative at any time before the city council, or any of its commissions, boards or agencies, by which he or she was formerly employed in connection with any case or other matter with which such person was duly connected in a policy-making capacity while with the city for two years following the termination of said employment with the city.

     Such official or former employee may be released from the obligation imposed by this section upon the submission of a written request to the city council in advance of his or her proposed appearance including a certification that, while an officer or employee of the city, he or she took no action or obtained no information which would prejudice their conduct or presentation, either while an officer or an employee, or at the time of the said presentation. Such a waiver request submitted to the city council will include a recommendation from the city manager. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.550 Dress and personal appearance policy.
     The city requires that each employee’s dress, grooming, and personal hygiene should be appropriate to the work situation. Acceptable personal appearance, like proper maintenance of work areas, is an ongoing requirement of employment with the city.

     A.    Employees are expected at all times to present a professional, businesslike image to the public, members of the city council and co-workers.

     B.     Employees who have regular contact with the public must comply with the following personal appearance standards:

     1.     Employees are expected to dress in a manner that is normally acceptable for the type of work performed;

     2.     Employees should not wear attire that is provocative and revealing, athletic clothing, shorts, flip flops or thong-type (beach footwear), T-shirts, symbols and emblems that are partisan or political, novelty buttons, and similar items of casual attire that do not present a businesslike appearance.

     Examples of inappropriate dress are exposed undergarments; excessively short or tight garments; bare midriff shirts; strapless shirts; shirts with slogans or large emblems; sweat suits; denim that is worn, faded, frayed, ripped, or bleached; sun dresses; halter tops; clothing with inappropriate advertising (e.g., cigarettes, beer or anything that portrays a negative image); tank tops, etc.;

     3.     Hair should be clean, combed and neatly trimmed or arranged.

     C.     Employees who do not regularly have contact with the public should follow basic requirements of safety and comfort, but should still be as neat and businesslike as working conditions permit.

     D.    Depending on the nature of their jobs, employees may be required to meet special dress, grooming and hygiene standards, such as wearing uniforms or other appropriate clothing.

     1.     Office Employees. Employees shall dress in a manner that allows them to attend and represent the city in a professional manner at meetings, commissions, boards, and other professional or public events, as needs require.

     2.     Field Employees. Uniformed employees are required to use their issued uniforms. Uniform shorts are acceptable, except when working in hazardous areas. Non-uniform employees must wear acceptable shirts that are conservative and muted in color. T-shirts and shirts with no collar are excluded. Walking shorts are acceptable with pockets in a solid conservative color. Specifically excluded are beach and multi-color shorts, gym or other shorts that do not resemble the city standard uniform shorts.

     3.     All other employees are prohibited from wearing shorts during work hours, unless pre-approved by the department head for non-hazardous fieldwork.

     E.     Casual Dress Days (Casual Friday). At its discretion, management may allow employees to dress in a more casual fashion than is normally required. On these occasions, employees are still expected to present a neat appearance and are not permitted to wear denim that is worn, faded, frayed, ripped, or bleached; or disheveled clothing, athletic wear, or similarly inappropriate clothing or accessories as described in subsection (B)(2) of this section.

     Any employee who does not meet the standards of this policy may be asked to take corrective action, which may include leaving the premises. Non-exempt employees will not be compensated for any work time missed because of failure to comply with this policy.

     Violations of the policy may result in disciplinary action. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.555 Technology usage and electronic communications policy.
     The city of Palm Desert encourages the use of electronic communications resources to share information in support of its mission of public service and to conduct its business. This policy governs all electronic communications resources including, but not limited to, the Internet, e-mail, voice-mail, listserves, boards, cellular telephones, pagers, personal digital assistants, smartphones, Blackberry devices, computers/laptops, telecommunications devices, video and audio equipment, wireless networks, data systems, telecommunications equipment, transmission devices, data processing or storage systems, computer systems, servers, networks, input/output and connecting devices, software, and documentation that supports electronic communications services (“electronic communications resources”).

     A.    Electronic Communications. The city’s e-mail system is an official communication tool for city business. An official e-mail address is established and assigned by the city to each employee. All city communications sent via e-mail will be sent to this address. City employees must use the official city e-mail, instead of their private e-mail address (such as yahoo, hotmail, etc.) or text messaging when communicating city business via e-mail so records can be properly managed.

     Electronic communications resources must be used in compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, and city policies including those that require a work environment free from discrimination and harassment. Electronic communications should conform to the same standards of propriety and respect as any other verbal or written communication at the city. Employees are expected to use common sense and judgment to avoid any communication which is disrespectful, offensive or illegal.

     The city, as the provider of access to its electronic communications resources, reserves the right to specify how those resources will be used and administered to comply with this policy. It is important to realize that the message content sent from the city’s account reflects upon the city (positively or negatively) to those who receive the message. Employees may be subject to disciplinary actions for using the electronic communications resources in a manner other than for their intended purposes or in a manner that violates applicable laws, rules and policies.

     Electronic communications to recipients on systems outside the city pass through systems and networks not managed by the city. The privacy and confidentiality of these messages is, therefore, not assured. In addition, some delivery methods and networks impose legal restrictions regarding the nature of messages allowed. Users are expected to comply with all such regulations. Employees and other users of the electronic communications resources may create criminal and civil liability for themselves and the city by using outside or third party systems in an offensive, defamatory or illegal manner and in such event employees and other users may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.

     The city’s technical resources are provided for the benefit of the city and its residents or customers, visitors, vendors, and suppliers. These resources are to be used while conducting city business. They are to be reviewed, monitored, and used only in that regard, except as otherwise provided in this policy.

     Access to networks and computer systems owned by the city imposes certain responsibilities and obligations on city employees and is granted subject to city policies. Appropriate use should always be legal, ethical, reflect honesty, reflect community standards, and show restraint in the consumption of shared resources. There is finite amount of bandwidth available at City Hall and high usage activities such as viewing videos, listening to audios, etc., limits the bandwidth available to others.

     B.     Incidental Personal Use. Electronic communication resources are provided by the city to facilitate the performance of city work. Incidental personal use is secondary, and should not: (1) interfere with the city’s operation of electronic communications resources; (2) interfere with the user’s employment or other obligations to the city; or (3) burden the city with noticeable incremental costs. Incidental use of the city’s electronic communications resources should clearly indicate that the use is personal. Users of electronic communications resources shall not give the impression that they are representing, giving opinions, or otherwise making statement on behalf of the city unless appropriately authorized to do so. The city is not responsible for any loss or damage incurred by an individual as a result of personal use of the city’s electronic communications resources.

     C.     Privacy Limits. The California Public Records Act requires the city to disclose specified public records. In response to requests for such disclosure, it may be necessary to examine electronic communications records that users may consider to be personal to determine whether they are public records that are subject to disclosure.

     All communications transmitted via the city’s electronic communications resources, whether or not related to personal or confidential matters, are subject to monitoring, at the city’s discretion. The city monitors communications transmitted via the city’s electronic communications resources in the ordinary course of business for purposes that include ensuring their reliability and security. The existence of passwords and “message delete” functions do not restrict or eliminate the city’s ability or right to access electronic communications.

     Employees should not communicate their private, privileged, or confidential information, including but not limited to personal attorney client communications, financial or medical information and other privileged information, via the city’s electronic communications resources. Employees who do communicate their private, privileged or confidential information via the city’s electronic communications resources will be deemed to have waived any privilege or privacy rights in those communications, even where those communications are made via personal password-protected accounts using the city’s electronic communications resources.

     Employees should keep in mind that when they are using the city’s computers, they are creating city documents using a city asset. The city’s computer, e-mail, or telephone systems, and the data stored in them are to remain properties of the city. As a result, computer data, messages, e-mail messages, and other data are readily available to numerous persons. Work transmitted on the computer system and other technical resources may be subject to investigation, search, and review by others per this policy.

     All information, including e-mail messages and files, created, sent or retrieved over the city’s technical resources is the property of the city, and should not be considered private or confidential. Employees should be aware that any electronically stored information created, sent, or received from others may be retrieved and reviewed when doing so serves the legitimate business interests and obligations of the city. Even when a file or message is erased or a visit to an Internet/website is closed, it is still possible to re-create the message or locate the website.

     The city reserves the right to monitor use of its technical resources at any time. All information, including text and images may be disclosed to law enforcement or to other third parties without prior consent of the sender or the receiver.

     Additionally, the city may be required to produce information transmitted or stored on its electronic communications resources pursuant to a court order, subpoena, or statute.

     D.    Restrictions. The information sources accessible via the Internet are worldwide and constantly growing in kind and number. It is not possible for any Internet access provider to fully manage the types of information accessible by its systems and users, especially with regard to content limitations. Nonetheless, the city reserves the right to restrict access to any data source, at its sole discretion. These restrictions do not constitute an implication of approval of other non-restricted sources.

     Without exhausting all the possibilities, the following are examples of inappropriate use of the city’s electronic communications resources:

     1.     Exposing others unwillingly, either through carelessness or intentions, to material which is offensive, obscene or in poor taste. This includes information which could create an intimidating, offensive or hostile work environment.

     2.     Any use that may, for a reasonable person, create or further a hostile attitude or give offense on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, ancestry, marital status, gender, disability, age, veteran’s status or sexual orientation.

     3.     Communicating confidential city information to unauthorized individuals within or outside of the city.

     4.     Sending messages or information which is in conflict with applicable laws or city policies, rules or procedures.

     5.     Attempting to access unauthorized data or break into any city or non-city system.

     6.     Engaging in theft or the unauthorized copying of electronic files or data.

     7.     Performing acts that are wasteful of computer resources or that unfairly monopolize resources to the exclusion of others is prohibited. These acts include, but are not limited to, sending mass mailings or chain letters and creating unnecessary network traffic.

     8.     Intentionally misrepresenting one’s identity.

     9.     Engaging in unlawful activities.

     10.   Engaging in commercial activity or activity for financial gain, not under the auspices of the city.

     11.   Engaging in political activities.

     12.   Engaging in recreational use of the city’s electronic communications resources that interferes with the ability of the employee or other users to conduct city work. This includes, but is not limited to, downloading or uploading software, games, or shareware. Employees are also prohibited from downloading and using instant messenger (IM).

     13.   Accessing the electronic communications resources with another employee’s password.

     14.   Unauthorized review, duplication, dissemination, removal, installation, damaging, or alteration of files, passwords, computer systems or programs, or other property of the city, or use of information obtained by unauthorized means, is prohibited.

     15.   Use by the city council, advisory board members, or staff that would violate the Brown Act.

     E.     Overtime—Prior Approval Required. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires that the city pay each employee who is entitled to receive FLSA overtime for all hours worked. This provision does not apply to employees who are exempt from FLSA overtime because of the executive, administrative, or professional nature of their job duties.

     1.     No time spent in any activity on the city’s electronic communications resources for the benefit of the city may be done outside of employee’s scheduled work hours without advance approval from the employee’s immediate supervisor. Emergencies may arise that call for an exception to this rule. In emergencies, the employee may perform the work, but must notify a supervisor as soon as possible, and in no event later than the end of that day. If the employee’s supervisor denies the request to work overtime, the employee must obey the supervisor’s directive and cease working overtime.

     2.     All time spent outside of the employee’s scheduled hours on the city’s electronic communications resources for the benefit of the city must be reported on official city forms so that the city may pay the employee for that work. Employees may never choose to work and not request compensation. All legitimate overtime will be compensated.

     3.     Employees are required to record all work time on official city records and to work overtime with approval. Failure to follow the city’s overtime approval procedures will result in being paid for all legitimate work time, and being subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination for violating the overtime approval procedures.

     F.     Retention Period for E-Mails. All e-mails on the city’s electronic communication resources will be automatically saved for three years. After this three-year period expires, the messages will be stored on DVD, or similar electronic data storage device, for an additional two years. After this two-year period, all messages will be permanently deleted.

     Individuals are responsible for ensuring that all pertinent e-mail files are properly managed, just as other paper mail. The e-mail system, or any electronic communication resource, should not be considered long-term storage for project files.

     G.    Software Policies. Employees are prohibited from installing software on any city technical resource without the express prior written permission from the IS department. Employees may not copy software from the city for personal use.

     H.    Copyrighted Materials. Employees should not copy and distribute copyrighted material (e.g., software, database files, documentation, articles, graphics files, and downloaded information) through the e-mail system unless they have confirmed in advance from appropriate sources that the city has the right to copy or distribute the material.

     Transmitting any materials in violation of any federal, state, or local laws, ordinances or regulations is prohibited; failure to observe a copyright may result in disciplinary action by the city and legal action by the copyright owner.

     Any questions concerning these rights should be directed to the IS department manager.

     I.      Employee Responsibilities. Each employee is responsible for the content of all text, audio, or images that they place or send over the city’s technical resources. Employees may access only files or programs that they have permission to enter.

     Violations of any guidelines in this policy may result in termination of access to the Internet and may also result in disciplinary or legal action up to and including termination of employment, and/or criminal or civil penalties or other legal action against the employee.

     Each employee is responsible for notifying their supervisor if they observe violations of this policy.

     The department of human resources will determine, through investigation, any violation to this policy and the appropriate disciplinary action and will work with supervisors if disciplinary action is necessary.

     J.      Special Policies for Use of Electronic Communication Devices at Public Meetings. This provision governs the use of all types of electronic devices that are designed or may be utilized to electronically communicate, or to process, transmit or store information, such as computers, cellular telephones, smart phones, iPads, tablets or similar (“electronic communication devices”) by the city council, and all city board, committee and commission members (“city officials”) and employees during meetings that are open to the public and subject to the Brown Act (“public meetings”). For purposes of this provision, the use of the phrase “participating in a public meeting” for city officials means that the city official is sitting at the dais and the public meeting is in session, and the use of the phrase for “city employees” means that the employee is required to attend the public meeting in order to fulfill some job related function as a city employee (e.g., to present a staff report or discuss a project that he or she has worked on with the council, board, committee or commission) and not just volitionally, voluntarily or for their own personal purposes, to observe the public meeting, and that the public meeting is in session. This provision is intended to promote the proper use of electronic communications devices by city officials and employees while participating in public meetings in order to ensure that all public meetings are conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Ralph M. Brown Act (“Brown Act”); to ensure that all hearings and deliberations that occur during public meetings comply with due process and result in a complete administrative record; and to preserve proper decorum preventing behavior that might lead to the perception that the public official is not fully engaged.

     1.     Use of Electronic Communications Devices to Send and Receive E-Mail and Text Messages by City Officials Participating in Public Meetings. A city official participating in a public meeting shall not use an electronic communications device to communicate with another city official participating in the same public meeting, or any other person with respect to matters that are the subject of the public meeting. While not strictly prohibited, use of an electronic communications device by a city official while participating in a public meeting to communicate with persons other than another city official participating in the same public meeting on matters that are not the subject of the public meeting is highly discouraged, except in emergency situations. Therefore, while participating in a public meeting, a city official may: (a) send or receive e-mail and text messages to and from family members or family caregivers where absolutely necessary for the care of that family member, in the reasonable discretion of the city official; and (b) send or receive e-mail and text messages that must be sent or received to address urgent business matters of the city official, that do not involve city business, in the reasonable discretion of the city official.

     2.     Use of Electronic Communications Devices by City Employees to Send and Receive E-Mail and Text Messages during Public Meetings—Telephone Calls. A city employee shall not use an electronic communications device to communicate with a city official who is participating in a public meeting. While not prohibited, the use of electronic communications devices by city employees to send and receive e-mail and text messages while participating in a public meeting is highly discouraged, except when absolutely necessary in the reasonable discretion of the employee. Therefore, while participating in a public meeting, a city employee may: (a) send or receive e-mail and text messages to and from family members or family caregivers where absolutely necessary for the care of that family member, in the reasonable discretion of the employee; and (b) send or receive e-mail and text messages that must be sent or received to address matters related to city business, in the reasonable discretion of the city employee. A city employee shall not use an electronic communications device to make or receive a phone call during a public meeting while in the room where the public meeting is being held. City employees shall ensure that all ringers or other features of electronic communications devices that make any sound or noise are disabled when entering a public meeting. In no event shall using an electronic communications device by a city employee to send or receive e-mail or text messages or make or receive a phone call disturb or interfere with a public meeting.

     3.     Use of Internet by City Officials. The use of electronic communications devices by a city official participating in a public meeting to access the Internet is prohibited, with the following exception: the Internet may be used to access the agenda packet and all documents that compose that packet for the public meeting that the city official using the electronic communication device is participating in.

     4.     Use of Internet by Employees. The use of electronic communications devices by employees to access the Internet while participating in a public meeting is discouraged, with the following exceptions: (a) the Internet may be used to access the agenda packet for the public meeting; (b) the Internet may be used to access other city documents that are relevant to topics being discussed at the public meeting in the reasonable discretion of the city employee; and (c) the Internet may be used to do research on topics that are the subject of the public meeting in the reasonable discretion of the city employee. In no event shall using an electronic communications device by a city employee to access the Internet disturb or interfere with a public meeting.

     5.     Public Records Act. All city records whether paper or electronic are governed by the public disclosures requirements of the California Public Records Act (“PRA”). Therefore, any information sent or received by public officials or employees on either city-owned or personal electronic communications devices during public meetings, that pertains to city business and otherwise qualifies as a disclosable public record under the PRA will be subject to disclosure upon request.

     6.     Due Process. The federal and California constitutional guarantee of due process require that all relevant evidence considered during hearings or deliberations that take place during public meetings on matters that involve protected rights such as land use applications and permit and license grants, denials or revocations (“hearing”), be introduced into and made part of the public record. Therefore, any information sent or received by city officials on electronic communications devices prior to or during a hearing that the public official relies on in making his or her decision (“material information”), must be disclosed and made part of the public record. Public officials shall disclose material information prior to the close of the public hearing or public comment portion of the hearing, whenever practicable, and in every event, before any action is taken on the item at the hearing. (Ord. 1234 § 2, 2012)

 

2.52.560 Safety policy.
     A.    Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP). The city has in place an injury and illness prevention program (IIPP) in accordance with California law, and which is available to all employees.

     All employees are required to understand and comply with the general and specific elements in the IIPP in order to prevent occupational injuries and illnesses. All additional applicable federal, state or local laws or regulations pertaining to occupational injuries or illnesses will be complied with at all times.

     1.     Procedure. Any employee who incurs an on-the-job injury or illness will receive immediate and appropriate first aid or medical treatment. The employee and supervisor must then comply with their reporting responsibilities and procedures.

     Whenever an incident occurs that requires any kind of first aid or medical treatment, no matter how minor, it is the responsibility of the affected employee or their supervisor to complete and submit a city first report of injury or illness as soon as practical and distribute the report to the department of human resources worker’s compensation administrator and to the risk manager. The report is available from the department of human resources or from the city intranet safety and emergency page.

     If the affected employee completes the report, it must be reviewed and approved by the employee’s supervisor before it is submitted. Based on the first report of injury or illness, the department of human resources worker’s compensation administrator will provide additional state-mandated reporting forms to the affected employee as appropriate. Failure to report an injury or illness as required by organization policy and state law could result in loss of compensation benefits and possibly lead to corrective action up to and including termination.

 

     2.     Reporting Responsibility. It is the responsibility of all employees to report immediately in writing to their supervisor all on-the-job injuries or illnesses regardless of how insignificant or minor the injury or illness may appear at the time. Incident report forms are provided for this purpose and may be obtained from any supervisor, human resources or the city’s risk manager.

     The supervisor will then complete a supervisor’s incident investigation report form. These reports should be sent to the city’s workers’ compensation administrator and to the department of human resources. Failure to report an injury or illness as required by state law and organization policy could result in loss of compensation benefits and possibly lead to corrective action up to and including termination.

     3.     Drug Testing. When an employee sustains an injury or illness that requires outside medical treatment, the employee may also be subject to a screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in their system, provided state law permits these tests.

     When an employee is involved in a mobile equipment accident that results in significant damage, the employee will be subject to a screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in their system, provided state law permits these tests. Any employee who refuses screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol will be subject to immediate termination.

     4.     Compensation During Injury Period. In the event the injury is of the nature that requires outside medical treatment, employees will be paid for their entire shift and should not clock out.

     If subsequent medical visits are necessary, employees should schedule those during nonwork hours if possible. Employees should clock out if the appointment is during their regular work shift. If employees must miss work in order to receive authorized medical follow-up treatments for a work-related injury or illness, they will receive pay for up to two hours per visit.

     B.     Blood and Bodily Fluids Exposure. The city is concerned about employees who may be exposed to blood and other bodily fluids when rendering first aid to other employees.

     The following procedures are to be used when administering first aid:

     1.     Always use the latex gloves that are provided by the city;

     2.     In the event CPR becomes necessary, a CPR micro-shield should be used. These are provided to all CPR certified employees by the city. Only those employees who are certified to perform CPR should perform CPR;

     3.     Any materials, including latex gloves and CPR micro-shields, used in administering first aid should be discarded in the red biohazard bags located in the first aid room;

     4.     Hands should be thoroughly washed following any first aid procedure.

     The red biohazard bags will be picked up by special arrangement with the local waste management company on a regular basis.

     C.     Licensed Equipment Operators. In order to provide a safe working environment, equipment operators should be properly trained and licensed.

     All equipment operators must be eighteen years of age and have a valid driver’s license. On a regular basis, each operator must successfully complete the city’s instructional course and a drug screening for certification to operate equipment.

     Any unsafe actions by a licensed operator will lead to personnel corrective action up to and including termination.

     Any employees choosing to operate equipment without proper training, license, and the consent of their supervisors will be subject to personnel corrective action up to and including termination.

     D.    Security and Loss Prevention. The city has installed and maintains an elaborate security system to protect the premises from fire, unlawful entry, and theft.

     Employees will be given the details of the system if it is determined that such knowledge is necessary to perform their job duties.

     Employees are encouraged to assist management in ensuring that the system is not compromised in any way. Tampering with the system, violating procedures, or revealing any details about the security system to others may result in personnel action, including termination.

     E.     Driver Authorization and Performance. The city requires that certain employees to be ready, able and licensed to drive as part of their employment classification.

     The ability and willingness to drive safely are extremely important for those employees who are required to drive in the performance of duty. It is necessary to reduce the city’s risk liability to a minimum level.

     Employees who drive particular types of vehicles in the performance of their regular duties for the city are subject to the safety-sensitive provisions of the city’s substance abuse policy.

     The risk manager shall review and analyze all employee accidents in order to control and minimize the risk liability of the city.

     1.     Responsibility. The department manager or director may authorize driving privileges to an employee who must drive a city-owned, a city-leased and/or a privately owned motor vehicle to perform his or her assigned functions, provided the employee meets the following requirements:

     a.     Possession of an appropriate, valid California motor vehicle operator’s license;

     b.     Has no physical impairment, which precludes driving with or without reasonable accommodations;

     c.     If a privately-owned vehicle is used, then employee must provide the city with a copy of a certificate of insurance showing minimum liability insurance coverage as required by the Financial Responsibility Law of the State Vehicle Code.

     General principles for valid use of the vehicle under assigned functions would include:

     a.     Use of the vehicle provides a defined approved benefit to the city;

     b.     Would not be excluded by our insurance coverage requirements;

     c.     Would prohibit nonemployee passengers unless they are present to further city business, i.e., a consultant.

     2.     Motor Vehicle Record Check. Motor vehicle record checks shall be made with the State Department of Motor Vehicles in the following instances:

     a.     New driver authorizations;

     b.     Renewals of driver authorizations;

     c.     Whenever deemed necessary by the city’s risk manager or the city manager. All record checks shall be deemed confidential materials.

     City employees eligible to drive city vehicles are part of the DMV “Pull Notice” program. The program, administered by the DMV, will notify the city when an employee’s license has been suspended or revoked.

     3.     Cancellation of Driving Privileges. Driving privileges are canceled if a motor vehicle record check on the employee reveals that such driver has a suspended or revoked license, or when such employee retires, terminates, is discharged or whenever the privilege is no longer necessary for job functions.

     4.     Poor Driving Performance. When an employee is required to drive in the performance of duty, failure to drive safely must be a matter of concern to the department manager or director. Poor driving, as other poor performance, can be a basis for discipline as provided in subsection (E)(3) of this section and Article IV of this chapter.

     5.     Risk Manager. The city’s risk manager shall review and analyze all employee accidents in order to control and minimize the city’s risk of liability. It shall be considered evidence of poor driving performance any time an authorized driver is found responsible for one or more preventable on-the-job vehicle accidents resulting in injury or death, or property damage exceeding two hundred fifty dollars.

     F.     Workers’ Compensation Policy. The city subscribes to and carries workers’ compensation insurance for its employees who may be injured or suffer illness while at work.

     Injuries occurring in the course of employment are paid for by workers’ compensation insurance. Workers’ compensation insurance pays all medical costs, without a deductible provision, and is paid for exclusively by the city.

     1.     Notice and Certification Requirements. Employees must report all accidents, injuries and illnesses, no matter how small, that occur during their work period to their im-mediate supervisor as soon as possible after the occurrence. In addition, employees must provide the city with a certification from a healthcare provider.

     2.     Guidelines. The following are well-defined provisions that must be met to ensure that employees qualify for workers’ compensation benefits:

     a.     Any work-related injury or illness must be immediately reported in writing to the employee’s supervisor;

     b.     The workers’ compensation insurer will investigate all late reported claims;

     c.     When facts cannot be verified, the claim may be denied;

     d.     Any claim for an injury or illness caused by an employee’s willful misconduct, alcohol, or drug usage or that occur during the employee’s voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by the city will not be compensable;

     e.     Workers’ compensation fraud is a felony, punishable by fines and/or jail time. The organization will prosecute any individual found to be claiming a work-related illness or injury fraudulently;

     f.      An approved physician must treat the injured employee. The city and its carrier in certain cases will assign specialists. Any treatment other than that approved by the city and its carrier will not be compensable. If requested, in writing, prior to an injury or illness, the city will permit employees to go to their own healthcare provider to obtain treatment.

     3.     Worker’s Compensation Benefits. There are two types of workers’ compensation benefits paid to an employee with a work-related injury or illness:

     a.     Medical benefits:

     i.      Physician’s Fees. The approved physician who provides treatment is paid through the workers’ compensation insurer;

     ii.     Hospital Fees. Paid in full;

     iii.    Pharmacy Costs. Paid in full if prescribed by an approved physician;

     iv.    Special Costs. Any other medical costs including but not limited to braces, crutches, physical therapy, and rehabilitation therapy if deemed necessary by an approved physician will be paid in full according to state law.

     b.     Wage replacement benefits:

     i.      Wage replacement benefits are paid during the time employees are temporarily disabled from a work-related injury or illness. Employees receive a percentage of their salary as set by state law.

     The workers’ compensation laws provide for a waiting period before injured employees become eligible for wage replacement benefits. Employees will be covered for the period of disability to the limit allowed under state workers’ compensation law. The workers’ compensation insurer will pay the employee. The check will be mailed to the employee’s home address.

     4.     Compensation During Leave. Employees may utilize any accrued vacation time, sick time and any other accrued paid time off during the leave. All such payments will be coordinated with any short or long-term disability, workers’ compensation, or other wage reimbursement benefits for which employees may be eligible.

     At no time shall an employee receive a greater total payment than the employee’s regular salary.

     5.     Benefits During Leave. If the employee taking workers’ compensation disability leave is eligible for leave under the Federal or State Family and Medical Leave Laws, the city will maintain the employee’s group health insurance coverage for twelve work weeks if that benefit has not been previously exhausted during the current family leave year and if such insurance was provided before the leave was taken, and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work.

     Employees on workers’ compensation disability who do not receive continued paid coverage, or whose paid coverage ceases after twelve work weeks, may continue their group health insurance coverage through the city in conjunction with COBRA guidelines, if applicable, by making monthly payments to the city for the amount of the relevant premium.

     Upon return from leave of absence, benefits will resume accruing in accordance with the specific requirements of each benefit.

     Employees should contact the human resources department for further information.

     6.     Sick and Vacation Leave Accrual. Vacation and sick leave will accrue during workers’ compensation leave.

     7.     Modified Duty. Employees who decline temporary modified duty in order to return to work from a leave of absence due to a workers’ compensation injury will be considered to have resigned and their employment with the city will be terminated.

     If an employee is eligible for family and medical leave due to the employee’s personal health condition, the employee will have his or her workers’ compensation benefits terminated if he or she refuses temporary modified duty for which the employee is qualified.

     8.     Reinstatement. Under most circumstances, upon submission of a medical certification that an employee is able to return to work from a workers’ compensation leave, the employee will be reinstated to his or her same position held at the time the leave began or to an equivalent position in terms of salary, duties, and promotional opportunities.

     An employee returning from a workers’ compensation leave has no greater right to reinstatement than if the employee had been continuously employed rather than on leave. For example, if the employee on workers’ compensation leave would have been laid off had he or she not gone on leave, or if the employee’s position has been eliminated or filled in order to avoid undermining the city’s ability to operate safely and efficiently during the leave, and there are no equivalent positions available, then the employee would not be entitled to reinstatement.

     9.     Failure to Return to Work. Any employee who fails to return to work after being released by an approved physician, as determined by the city’s carrier, will be considered to have resigned and will be terminated from employment with the city.

     G.    Temporary Modified Duty Policy. The city has a temporary modified duty policy for injured or ill employees who are able to return to work in other capacities.

     The city is committed to providing work, when possible, for employees who have been restricted by a physician due to a work-related injury or illness. Such work:

     1.     Will be provided subject to availability;

     2.     Will be assigned due to the nature of the injury or illness and the limitations set forth by the treating physician; and

     3.     Every effort will be made to place employees in positions within their own departments, but if necessary, employees will be placed wherever an appropriate position is available.

     While on temporary modified duty, employees will continue to receive their regular rate of pay. Employees who are placed outside their department will continue to have their salary charged to their regular department.

     Employees on temporary modified duty must furnish a written update of their medical condition to his or her supervisor with a copy to the department of human resources from the treating physician after each visit in order to remain in the reassigned job.

     Temporary modified duty assignments are limited to a period of ninety days, subject to review.

     Being placed on a temporary modified duty assignment does not excuse an employee from following all of the city’s rules, regulations and policies. (Ord. 1345 § 3, 2019; Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.565 City emergency situation.
     In the event of declared city emergency, all city employees are emergency service workers. If an emergency occurs during nonwork hours, employees must attempt to contact the city emergency response hotline as published in the “City Hall Emergency Procedures and Emergency Phone Numbers” book provided to all employees, for the declaration of emergency, and the status of city operations. If unable to reach the hotline, all employees should, unless physically incapacitated, return to work as soon as practical after the emergency has occurred. The emergency handbook also lists an emergency message line phone number for employees to call to leave a message if they cannot report in a timely manner. Employees who are primary or alternate emergency response team members are to report to the emergency operations center for emergency team assignment by their section chief. All other employees not listed on the team may also be assigned emergency team duties as necessary, and are to report to work. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

VI. HOURS OF WORK
2.52.600 Workweek and overtime.
     Employees who are subject to the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, shall be compensated in the manner set forth in such act and the regulations duly adopted pursuant thereto.

     A.    Workweek Designated. The official workweek shall begin at one minute after twelve a.m. Saturday and end at twelve midnight of the following Friday.

     A work week which is different than the work week as set forth in this subsection may be established for departments, divisions within departments and individual employees, if requested by a department director or manager and approved by the city manager, and if documented in payroll records.

     B.     Overtime-Nonexempt Employees. Nonexempt employees must record their actual time worked for payroll and benefit purposes from the time work begins and ends, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period. Nonexempt employees must also record any departure from work for any nonwork-related reason.

     When operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours, an employee may be scheduled to work overtime. A supervisor must authorize all overtime work in advance. Working overtime without prior authorization may result in disciplinary action. Nonexempt employees will be paid time and one-half compensation for all hours worked in excess of forty hours in one workweek.

     Department directors or managers may authorize overtime work for an employee. Unless otherwise agreed to, work in excess of forty hours in a workweek shall be considered overtime work.

     Vacation leave and sick leave hours shall not be considered hours worked in the computation of overtime. Over-

time work performed by an employee shall be compensated by payment at the rate of one and one-half times the employees’ regular rate of pay for the workweek in which overtime was worked. (Ord. 1121 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.605 Compensatory time off.
     In lieu of overtime pay, comp time off or “CTO” may be granted to employees up to a maximum of forty hours, at the discretion of management.

     A request to use CTO made at least five days in advance shall be presumed reasonable and shall be granted unless such use will unduly disrupt the operations of the city. An undue disruption is any event or circumstance which will cause the department to be unable to provide an acceptable level of service to the public if the employee is absent, such as a holiday, special event, widespread illness, or other unusual event.

     Earned compensatory time off shall be taken as soon as possible after the date that it is earned. However, earned compensatory time off not taken within ninety calendar days of such overtime work shall be cashed out.

     Calculating Compensatory Time Off. When CTO is granted in place of overtime pay, it is calculated at one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over forty in a work week, or two at the employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight in a day. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.610 Standby pay.
     Whenever a nonexempt employee is scheduled for uncontrolled standby duty such employee will be considered to be on-call. “On-call” means and includes that period of time, other than regularly scheduled work time, during which an employee may be called back to provide services that are the responsibility of the department in which the employee is employed.

     During this period of “on-call”, the employee is free to engage in the employee’s regular activities so long as the employee is available to respond by phone or beeper within a reasonable period of time, typically one hour, and is in a condition to work.

     Such employee shall be compensated by a payment at the employee’s regular rate of pay in the workweek in which standby duty was incurred in accordance with the following:

     A.    Two hours per day, each weekday;

     B.     Three hours per day, each Saturday, Sunday or holiday.

     An employee who is “called back” and reports to duty while on-call will not receive standby pay, but will, instead, receive callback pay in accordance with the procedures stated in Section 2.52.615 of this article. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.615 Callback pay.
     “Callback” means and includes those occasions when a nonexempt employee reports to duty during off-duty hours responding to a city request made after the employee has completed the normal shift and left the work station.

     For purposes of callback, time spent by the employee in traveling to and from the employee’s place of residence to the work area shall not be considered hours worked.

     Whenever a nonexempt employee is called back for duty during off hours, such employee shall be credited with a minimum of two hours work time plus time actually worked in excess of two hours.

     Such employee shall be compensated by a payment at the rate of one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay in the workweek that callback duty incurred. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

VII. BENEFITS
2.52.700 Holidays.
     All regular and probationary full-time employees of the city shall receive eight or four hours pay for each holiday, as described in this section.

     All regular and probationary part-time personnel, as defined in Section 2.52.305, shall receive holiday hours pay proportionate to their scheduled hours of work on the designated holiday. “Scheduled hours” are determined by the department head; example, city hall closed for eight hours for Independence Day, employees normally scheduled to work five hours on that day would receive five hours of holiday pay. Employees on a leave of absence as defined in Section 2.52.835 are not eligible for holiday pay.

     A.    Designated Holidays. Designated holidays currently include:

*      Half-Day Holidays. Should these two days fall on a city workday, the holiday will start at twelve noon. All employees must complete a total of four hours work on such days, providing department coverage until twelve noon. Any nonexempt employee not working a complete four hours will need to show the difference from accrued leave balances (i.e. if the employee is on vacation the timecard would show four hours vacation and four hours holiday). When these two days fall on a noncity workday, employees are eligible for one additional full day floating holiday in accordance with the policies and practices currently applicable to floating holiday.

 

     B.     Floating Holiday.

     1.     Regular Employees. Regular full-time employees shall earn and be granted one floating holiday, which can be taken any time during the year with advance approval from their department manager or director. Floating holidays can accrue up to a maximum of one day, except during those years where an additional floating holiday is granted. Once this cap is reached, no additional floating holidays will be awarded until one of the days is used. There will be no retroactive grant of floating holiday compensation for the period of time the accrued holidays were at the cap.

     2.     Probationary Employees. Probationary employees may accrue floating holiday(s) as provided to all other employees but only after they have met their probationary period and are appointed to become regular employees. Probationary employees cannot use floating holidays until and after they have become regular employees. (Ord. 1319 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.705 Vacation leave.
     A.    Eligibility. All regular full-time employees and all regular part-time employees employed on a half-time basis or more may take accrued vacation with pay after satisfactorily completing the six-months probationary period.

     Vacation leave accrues only when an eligible employee is in an active employment status, or while an employee is on an approved family medical leave. Vacation leave ceases to accrue at the later of the expiration of family leave eligibility or when the employee exhausts his/her vacation and sick leave balances.

     Employees designated as Group X: Executive Contract earn and use vacation according to the terms of their particular employment agreement.

     1.     Probationary Employees. Probationary employees accrue vacation leave provided to all other employees based on their classification, but these accruals will not vest or be credited to them until and after they have completed their probationary period. Probationary employees cannot use vacation leave until and after they have become regular employees.

     Absences during the probationary period will be unpaid.

     2.     Temporary or Seasonal Employees. Temporary or seasonal employees do not accrue vacation benefits.

     B.     Rate of Vacation Accruals. Regular full-time employees accrue a maximum of ten working days during each of the first two years of continuous service, and thereafter one additional day for each year of continuous service to a maximum of twenty working days.

     1.     Employees designated as Exempt Personnel, Group A earn an additional ten days vacation each year plus the continuous service accrual.

     2.     Employees designated as Exempt Personnel, Group B earn an additional five days vacation each year plus the continuous service accrual.

     3.     Employees designated as Group X, Executive Contract, earn and use vacation according to the terms of their particular employment agreement.

     C.     Maximum Accrual of Vacation. Vacation accrues up to a maximum of three times the amount of time the employee is currently eligible to earn each year. For example, if the employee is eligible to earn ten days a year, the employee stops earning vacation once his or her accrual reaches thirty days. The same applies to exempt employees in Group A and Group B.

     Once this cap is reached, no further vacation will be earned until enough vacation is used to bring the employee below the cap. Only when the accrual falls below the cap will vacation compensation again commence to accrue until it reaches the applicable cap.

     Employees designated as Group X, Executive Contract, earn and use vacation according to the terms of their particular employment agreement.

     D.    Approval of Use of Vacation Leave. No vacation may be taken at any time without approval of the employee’s supervisor and/or department director. The times during a calendar year at which employees may take their vacations shall be determined by their department director or the city manager with due regard for the wishes of the employee and particular regard for the needs of the city.

     Two-Week Notice. Employees who request more than three consecutive days of vacation time off should do so with at least a two-week in advance notice. Depending on departmental workload and circumstances, managers may or may not grant the requested vacation time off.

     E.     Holidays or Illness During Vacation Leave. Whenever a holiday, as set forth above, falls within an employee’s vacation period, the employee shall be entitled to the holiday with pay and it shall not be charged towards vacation leave.

     Illness during a vacation period shall not be considered as sick leave unless the employee provides a physician’s certificate and receives approval from the City Manager.

     F.     Accrued Vacation Time Buy-Back. All regular full and half-time employees with one hundred twenty accrued vacation hours, may, upon written request, be compensated for up to a maximum of forty hours of accrued vacation per calendar year, instead of taking vacation time off. The same applies to exempt employees in Group A and Group B.

     G.    Payment for Accrued Vacation Time Upon Termination. Employees will be paid for unused accrued vacation time upon termination of employment, minus tax deductions as required by state and federal taxing laws. (Ord. 1315 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.710 Sick leave.
     A.    Defined. Sick leave is leave from duty which may be granted by the city to an employee because of illness, injury, exposure to contagious disease, illness or injury of a member of the employee’s immediate family requiring the employee’s attendance, and medical, dental and optical appointments to the extent that such appointments cannot be scheduled outside the work day.

     1.     An employee’s immediate family shall consist of the employee’s: spouse; registered domestic partner; children; step-children, or the mother, father, brother, sister, grandchildren or grandparents of the employee, spouse, registered domestic partner or other members of the employee’s family residing in the employee’s home; or other members of the employee’s family primarily dependent upon the employee.

     B.     Sick Leave Use.

     1.     An employee may be granted sick leave only in case of actual sickness as defined in subsection A. In the event that an employee or a member of the employee’s immediate family recovers from any such sickness after being granted sick leave, and during the regularly scheduled hours of work, then such employee shall notify the appropriate immediate supervisor and be available to return to duty.

     2.     When an employee is going to be absent due to illness or a medical condition that prevents him or her from coming to work, the employee shall notify his or her department director or manager, or designee, as soon as possible, but, unless there is an emergency circumstance, no later than one hour after the time set for beginning daily duties. Failure to do so without good reason may result in that day of absence being treated as leave of absence without pay.

     3.     If the employee is absent on sick leave for more than three days, the employee will keep the immediate supervisor informed as to the date the employee expects to return to work.

     4.     Sick leave will not be granted to any employee absent from duty as a result of any sickness, injury or disability purposely self-inflicted or caused by willful misconduct.

     5.     Sick leave will not be granted to any employee absent from duty after separation from service, or during an authorized leave of absence without pay, or any other absence from duty not authorized by the city.

     6.     Sick leave will not be granted to any employee to permit an extension of the employee’s vacation.

     7.     Sick leave will be accrued by any employee during the first three full calendar months of the employee’s employment. However, only upon the successful completion of three months of employment, will the employee be entitled to utilize accrued sick leave.

     8.     A department manager or supervisor may require a physician’s note or certificate from employees absent for more than three consecutive work days to be filed with human resources department, excusing their absence and confirming their fitness to return to duty.

     9.     Supervisors shall have the discretion to place employees on sick leave when, in the judgment of the supervisor, the presence of the employee at work would endanger the health and welfare of other employees or where the illness or injury of the employee interferes with the performance of such employee’s duties.

     C.     Sick Leave Accrual.

     1.     All employees will accrue one work day of sick leave, for each calendar month of service. Such accrual shall take place on a bi-weekly basis.

     2.     Sick leave may be accrued to without a maximum except as provided below:

     a.     Sick leave granted by the city and used by an employee shall be deducted from the employee’s accrued sick leave balance.

     3.     Employees granted a leave of absence with pay or other approved leave with pay shall accrue sick leave as provided herein.

     4.     Sick leave will not be accrued by an employee absent from duty after separation from service, or during an authorized leave of absence without pay, or any other absence from duty not authorized by the city.

     D.    Reimbursement for Accrued Sick Leave. Upon separation, an employee who has a sick leave accrual balance of one hundred ninety-two hours or greater, and has a minimum of four years of full-time city service may be paid a percentage of the employee’s total accrued sick leave according to the table below. Such reimbursement shall be at the employee’s base rate of pay at the time of separation. Under the provisions and limitations of CalPERS contract options Section 20965, the balance of unused and unpaid sick leave may be converted to additional service credit, for employees who retire within four months of their date of separation from Palm Desert.

     Assuming the above criteria are met, the percentage cash-out is based on the following schedule:

 

YEARS OF SERVICE

PERCENTAGE OF PAYOUT

Less than four

0

Over four but less than seven

25%

Over seven but less than ten

35%

Over ten but less than thirteen

45%

Over thirteen but less than sixteen

55%

Over sixteen

65%

*      All service time used for the calculation must be full-time paid city service in order to qualify.

 

     E.     Abuse of Sick Leave. An employee shall be subject to disciplinary action for abuse of sick leave which is defined as a claim of entitlement to sick leave when the employee does not meet the requirements of sick leave as defined in subsection A.

     F.     Excessive Use of Sick Leave. Excessive use of sick leave, tardiness, and failing to use the call-in procedures when absent or tardy, can negatively impact the performance of your job or affect others in the performance of their job. Factors that will be considered in determining whether use of sick leave is excessive include, but are not limited to, whether absenteeism is limited to a finite time period or whether it continues over time, the basis for the absenteeism and the significance of the impact on the performance of your job or of others.

     G.    Return to Work.

     1.     Regular employees unable to perform the essential functions of their position, with or without reasonable accommodation, as a result of a physical or psychological illness or injury for a period of one year from the first date of the absence shall:

     a.     Be terminated from employment. Employees who are separated pursuant to this section shall be accorded procedural due process (i.e., notice and an opportunity to respond to the separation) in accordance with the appeal procedures for disciplinary actions outlined in these rules and procedures; or

     b.     If disabled, be retired under the public employees’ retirement system; or

     c.     Be offered the opportunity to resign from the position and be placed on a rehire list for a period not to exceed one year. Any employee returning to work pursuant to this section shall provide to the human resources office verification from a medical practitioner of his or her ability to return to work and perform the essential functions of his or her position, with or without accommodation.

     If during the period in which the employee is on the rehire list, the employee is physically and/or psychologically able to resume the duties of his or her previous position and there is a vacant position in the employee’s classification, the employee will be entitled to return to that position with all the rights, benefits, and responsibilities of a regular employee. However, an employee on a rehire list shall not accrue seniority, nor step increase eligibility. Thus, the employee will return to work with the same amount of seniority held prior to being placed on the rehire list, including for purposes of determining vacation accrual rate.

     Placement on the rehire list does not preclude an employee from applying for a disability retirement.

     d.     Medical Leaves of Absence. Employees on family and medical care leave, pregnancy disability leave or other statutory leaves will not be terminated or offered the rehire list option in lieu of separation during such leave if separation during such leave would be precluded by law.

     2.     Whenever an employee has been given a permanent and stationary rating by the Industrial Accident Commission of the State of California, return to the job must be based on the same medical information that the employee used in order to obtain the award. Unless these medical facts are very carefully considered, subsequent injuries or aggravations of the original injury can occur. It is the policy of the city that an employee return to duties he or she can perform safely without undue risk or further injury to other employees.

     It is, likewise, the policy of the city that if the employee cannot do so or if he or she is unable or unwilling to accept some other vacant position which the employee is psychologically and/or physically and otherwise qualified to perform, his or her employment will be terminated.

     The medical criteria presented to the Industrial Accident Commission by the employee and his or her doctor shall be obtained and utilized by the city and interpreted in terms of specific job restrictions and limitations. The department director, or designee, shall then interpret and apply such job restrictions and limitations to the specific physical and/or psychological requirements of the employee’s posi-

tion and make a recommendation to the human resources department head.

     A determination shall be made by the human resources department head as to whether or not the employee shall:

     a.     Return to the job;

     b.     Transfer to some other vacant position for which he or she is qualified based upon physical or psychological ability and experience;

     c.     Separate from employment.

     H.    Conflict with Memorandum of Understanding. If a negotiated memorandum of understanding (MOU) provision is in conflict with a provision of this policy, the MOU provision shall be followed unless this provision was negotiated more recently. (Ord. 1298 § 1, 2015)

 

2.52.715 Domestic partner benefits.
     The memorandum of understanding between the city and Palm Desert employees organization provides for the enrollment of registered domestic partners of employees under the city’s health benefits plans.

     Eligible employees and certain of their family members have the right to continue health care coverage, at their own expense, under the city’s group health plans as provided in the Consolidated Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act (COBRA) and Cal-COBRA, provided that they elect to do so within a specified time period after one of several “qualifying events.”

     The city will provide eligible employees or their families notice of the right to continuation coverage after the following qualifying events: (1) the death of the covered employee; (2) the covered employee’s termination (other than by reason of the employee’s gross misconduct); (3) reduction in the covered employee’s hours; or (4) the covered employee’s eligibility for Medicare.

     A.    Service Club Reimbursement. In order to promote a spirit of cooperation and understanding with citizens, and to give key employees, as determined by the city manager, an opportunity to share in services to the community, the city’s annual budget may include provisions for reimbursement to selected employees for the cost of initiation fees, annual dues and related costs in local service clubs.

     Employees should submit requests for reimbursement under this provision to their respective supervisor to be submitted to the city manager for approval.

2.52.740 Seminars and work-related training.
     The city encourages employees to broaden their knowledge and improve their skills in their city occupational field or area to improve their on-the-job performance, and increase their overall value to the city by attending seminars, conferences, training workshops and/or certificate licensing programs.

     Under this program, the city will pay for the cost of these training or will reimburse employees who pay for them ahead of time.

     Reimbursement is available for regular full-time employees who are performing their job in a satisfactory manner, and requests for reimbursement are subject to the approval of the department director or manager, the director of human resources and the city manager.

     Seminars, conferences, training workshops and/or certificate licensing programs contemplated under this program are defined as courses of study that are specifically related to the employee’s presently assigned position. These trainings are generally completed within five days and usually require attendance during regular working hours.

     To qualify for payment, this type of training must be provided by or through an educational institution, a professional society, or an approved contracting agency.

     This type of training will not be eligible under this program if the knowledge can be obtained through in-house training, or if it is oriented solely towards personal satisfaction or enjoyment.

     Employees who attend seminars or training will be compensated for hours worked when any of the following apply: (1) it is required by the city; (2) the seminar or training is directly related to the employee’s current job; (3) the employee performs productive work during the seminar or training; or (4) the seminar or training occurs during normal work hours, regardless of the day of the week.

     Approved educational reimbursement request forms should be submitted to the human resources department to make appropriate reservations and prepay seminar costs. Reimbursable expenses include: meals, travel, mileage, hotel costs and parking costs, with a completed travel expense form submitted to the finance department.

     The procedure for seminar or conference attendance is as follows:

     A.    Employee requests approval of attendance from manager or supervisor;

     B.     If approved by manager or supervisor, employee completes education reimbursement request form, attaches seminar information and registration form and forwards to department director or manager for approval;

     C.     If approved, department director or manager will submit to human resources for approval;

     G.    After attending the seminar, the employee will provide human resources with any certificate, attendance verification and/or receipts related to the seminar;

     H.    Human resources will maintain copies of certificates, attendance verifications in the employee’s file and prepare a voucher for any reimbursements due the employee. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.745 Certificate or licensing programs.
     The city will pay the cost for employees whose job qualifications require certification or licensure to obtain recertification or licensure for the specific position held.

     Certificate and/or licensing programs are usually a series of courses that need to be completed in order to obtain a document certifying that one has fulfilled the requirements of a program.

     The certificate program or a specific license or renewal of a license must be job-related to the employees presently assigned position. “Job related” means and includes courses which maintain or improve the employee’s job performance; meets any specified education requirements of the employer or profession licensure; or meets any requirements necessary for the employee to retain his or her salary status, or employment.

     Certificates or licenses covered under this program must be provided by or through an educational institution, a professional society, or an approved contracting agency; must contain sufficient content and requirements; must be the most effective means of obtaining the knowledge; and must have a reasonable expectation of providing more effective on-the-job service by the employee.

     If the certificate or license is an ongoing requirement of the employee’s job classification, reservations and prepayment will be made by the human resources department following receipt of the approved education reimbursement request form. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.750 Education reimbursement/tuition program.
     The city subscribes to and supports an educational tuition reimbursement program for the benefit of employees who want to further their education.

     Employees who, in their sole discretion, want to broaden their knowledge by pursuing academic training and higher education on their off-duty hours may receive reimbursement for tuition as provided herein. Under this program, reimbursement is available for full-time regular employees who are performing their job in a satisfactory manner.

     The cost of tuition, under this program, will be reimbursed at the rate charged by the local community college or at the rate charged by the California State System. Requests are subject to the approval of the department manager or director, the director of human resources and the city manager.

     Continuing education under this program is defined as college level course work necessary to obtain a diploma or degree. The city, at management’s discretion, may also reimburse employees for related book and parking expenses for degree programs subject to the following criteria:

     A.    That a degree or certificate is sought;

     B.     Applicability of the degree to future positions in the organization;

 

     C.     Classes may be taken at a community college or state college.

     D.    Courses may not be taken during the employee’s regular working hours; unusual exceptions require appropriate approval;

     E.     Completion of the course must be verified with a grade of “C” or better.

     Grades and receipts must be submitted to the human resources department no later than ninety days after completing the course work in order to be processed for reimbursement.

     The procedure for requesting reimbursement for continuing education is as follows:

     A.    Employee completes education reimbursement request form and submits to department director or manager for approval;

     B.     If approved, department director or manager will submit to human resources for approval;

     C.     If approved by human resources, the request will be forwarded to the city manager for approval;

     D.    If approved by city manager the request will be returned to human resources and a copy of the approved form will be returned to the employee;

VIII. LEAVES
2.52.800 Short term leave.
     Employees who need to be absent for less than one day for personal reasons may use short-term leave with the prior approval of the employee’s supervisor. Employees who request and are granted this leave will have to use accrued vacation hours. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.805 Family care and medical leave.
     To the extent not already provided for under current leave policies and provisions, the city will grant family care and medical leave in accordance with the requirements of applicable state (California Family Rights Act) and federal law (Family and Medical Leave Act) in effect at the time the leave is granted. No greater or lesser leave benefits will be granted than those set forth in the relevant state or federal laws. In certain situations, the federal law requires that provisions of state law apply. In any case, employees will be eligible for the most generous benefits available under either law.

     A.    Definitions. “Twelve-month period” means a rolling twelve-month period measured backward from the date leave is taken and continuous with each additional leave day taken.

     “Child” means a child under the age of eighteen years of age, or eighteen years of age or older who is incapable of self care because of a mental or physical disability. An employee’s child is one for whom the employee has actual day-to-day responsibility for care and includes, a biological, adopted, foster or stepchild.

     A child is “incapable of self care” if he/she requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily self care in three or more of the activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living—such as, caring for grooming and hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating, cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills, maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, etc.

     4.     Nurse practitioners and nurse-midwives and clinical social workers who are authorized to practice under California State law and who are performing within the scope of their practice as defined under California State law;

     5.     Christian Science practitioners listed with the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts; and

     6.     Any health care provider from whom an employer or group health plan’s benefits manager will accept certification of the existence of a serious health condition to substantiate a claim for benefits.

     “Leave” means leave under this policy as provided for in the FMLA and CFRA.

     “Parent” means the biological parent of an employee or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis (in place of a parent) to an employee when the employee was a child. This term does not include parents-in-law.

     “Spouse” means a husband or wife as defined or recognized under California State law for purposes of marriage.

     “Serious health condition” means an illness, injury impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:

     1.     Any injury, illness, or impairment that involves inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility;

     2.     A period of incapacity which is permanent or long term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be under the continuing supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment by, a health care provider;

     3.     Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery there from) by a health care provider or by a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment;

     4.     Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or prenatal care;

     5.     Continuing treatment by a health care provider which includes a period of incapacity for three or more consecutive calendar days, requires two or more treatments (visits) to the health care provider, or requires at least one visit to the health care provider followed by a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider.

     A “chronic condition” is also covered by this policy, and means a condition which:

     1.     Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider;

     2.     Continues over an extended period of time;

     3.     May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).

     B.     Employee Eligibility. To be eligible for family and medical leave benefits, an employee must:

     1.     Have worked for the city for a total of at least twelve months;

     2.     Have worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty hours over the previous twelve months.

     C.     Amount of Leave Available. Eligible employees may receive up to a total of twelve workweeks of unpaid leave during a twelve-month period. The twelve-month period begins on the date of the first absence qualifying for leave, and rolls forward from that date. In other words, how much leave an employee is entitled to depends on how much time they have taken during the twelve-month period prior to their request for leave.

     For example, if an employee takes four weeks of leave beginning September 1, 2004, and then takes another four weeks beginning January 1, 2005 (total eight weeks), they would only have four weeks of leave available until September 1, 2005.

     D.    Intermittent Leave and Minimum Duration of Leave. As required by a health care provider, employees may take family and medical leave intermittently, which means taking leave in blocks of time, or by reducing their normal weekly or daily work schedule. Intermittent leave can be taken in hourly increments and will be counted toward the twelve-week allotment in the increments taken (twelve weeks equals four hundred eighty hours).

     If leave is requested for the birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child of the employee, leave must be concluded within one year of the birth or placement of the child. In addition, the basic minimum duration of such leave is two weeks. However, an employee is entitled to leave for one of these purposes (e.g., bonding with a newborn) for at least one day, but less than two weeks duration on any two occasions.

     E.     Reasons for Leave. Leave may only be used for one or more of the following reasons:

     1.     For the birth or placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care;

     2.     To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition;

     3.     To care for a newborn child (birth to twelve months of age);

     4.     To take medical leave when the employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her position because of a serious health condition.

     Pregnant employees may have the right to take a pregnancy disability leave in addition to a family and medical leave and should review the pregnancy disability leave policy below and notify their supervisor or the human resources department if they need leave due to disability caused by pregnancy.

     F.     Spouses Both Employed by the City. In any case in which a husband and wife both employed by the city are entitled to leave, the aggregate number of work weeks of leave to which both are entitled is limited to twelve work weeks during any twelve-month period if leave is taken for the birth or placement for adoption or foster care of the employees’ child (i.e., bonding leave). This limitation does not apply to any other type of leave under this policy.

     G.    Notice and Certification. An employee needing family and medical leave may be required to provide:

     1.     Thirty-day advance notice when the need for the leave is foreseeable (e.g., for childbirth or elective surgery);

     2.     Medical certification from a health care provider (both prior to the leave and prior to reinstatement);

     3.     Medical re-certification, periodically as allowed by state and federal law;

     4.     Reports during the leave verifying continued need for leave, periodically as allowed by state and federal law.

     Unforeseeable circumstances do not require thirty days advance notice. In such case, an employee must give notice as soon as practical. Failure to give timely notice may affect the ability to take leave as requested until the city can adequately cover the employee’s position with a substitute.

     When leave is needed to care for an immediate family member or the employee’s own serious health condition, and is for planned medical treatment, employees must use all good faith efforts to schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the city’s operation.

     H.    Compensation During Leave. Family and medical leave is unpaid. However, employees are required to use any accumulated sick leave and vacation leave, if the leave is for their own serious health condition.

     The paid leave time runs concurrently with the unpaid leave under this policy. If the leave is due to the serious health condition of a family member the employee must use his or her accrued vacation leave and may, but is not required to, use his or her sick pay benefits during the leave.

     Depending on individual circumstances and if available, an employee may be eligible for short-term disability, long-term disability or workers’ compensation insurance coverage while on leave.

     For example, if an employee has ten days accrued sick leave and ten days accrued vacation at the time their leave begins, and the leave is for the employee’s own serious health condition, the paid accrued leaves and leave under this policy shall run concurrently, and the first four weeks of leave will be with pay and eight weeks will be without pay for a total leave of twelve weeks.

     I.      Benefits During Leave. The city will maintain, for up to a maximum of twelve workweeks of family and medical leave, any group health insurance coverage that was provided before the leave on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work.

     If an employee is responsible for any portion of the group health insurance premium or for any other premium payment(s), the employee should, prior to the commencement of leave, make arrangements with the finance department for the submission of such payments.

     J.      Sick and Vacation Leave Accrual. Sick leave and vacation leave continue to accrue only while an employee is on paid family leave.

     K.    Job Reinstatement. Upon return from family and medical leave, an employee will be reinstated to their previous position, or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions. However, upon return from a family and medical leave, an employee has no greater right to reinstatement, benefits, and other conditions of employment than if he/she had been continuously employed rather than on leave.

     If an employee is returning from family and medical leave taken for his or her own serious health condition, but the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job because of a physical or mental disability, the city will begin an interactive process to determine whether the city can reasonably accommodate the employee without posing an undue hardship on the city.

     The city may deny reinstatement to a “key” employee (i.e., an employee who is among the highest paid ten percent of all employed by the city within seventy-five miles of the work site) if such denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the city, and the employee is notified of the city’s intent to deny reinstatement on such basis at the time the employer determines that such injury would occur.

     L.     Unlawful Acts. It is unlawful for the city to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided by state or federal family and medical leave law. it is also unlawful for the city to refuse to hire, discharge, discriminate against, or retaliate against any individual for being involved in any proceedings related to family and medical leave.

     M.    Required Forms. Employees must fill out the following applicable forms in connection with leave under this policy:

     1.     “Request for family or medical leave form” prepared by the city to be eligible for leave;

     2.     Medical certification. Either for the employee’s own serious health condition or for the serious health condition of a child, parent or spouse;

     3.     Authorization for payroll deductions for benefit plan coverage continuation; and

     4.     Fitness-for-duty to return from leave form. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.810 Bereavement leave.
     An employee is entitled to a leave of absence in the event of the death of a member of his or her immediate family, not to exceed three days per calendar year. No deduction shall be made from the salary of such employee nor shall such leave be deducted from leave granted by other provisions.

     An employee’s immediate family shall consist of the following:

     A.    Employee’s spouse, child, stepchild, parent, step-parent, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law;

     B.     Domestic partner;

     C.     Legal guardians and custodial children.

     Additionally, employees may utilize up to six days of sick leave or vacation leave if additional leave is needed due to the death of an immediate family member as defined in this section. (Ord. 1345 § 4, 2019; Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.815 Pregnancy disability leave.
     The city will grant an unpaid pregnancy disability leave for up to four months if an employee is disabled because of pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.

     A.    Notice and Certification Requirements. Requests for pregnancy disability leave must be submitted in writing and must be approved by the employee’s supervisor or department head before the leave begins.

     The request must be supported in writing by an attending physician that the employee is disabled from working by pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition, and must state the expected duration of the disability and date of return to work.

     All granted leaves must be confirmed in writing, have an agreed-upon specific date of return, and be submitted to the director of human resources prior to being taken. Requests for an extension of leave must be submitted in writing to human resources prior to the agreed date of return and must be supported in writing by the statement of the attending physician that the employee continues to be disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition. California law provides that the maximum pregnancy disability leave right is four months.

     Failure to return to work after the maximum four-month leave period causes the employee to have no reinstatement rights.

     B.     Compensation During Leave. Pregnancy disability leaves are without pay. However, an employee may utilize sick leave, vacation leave, and any other accrued paid time off during the leave.

     C.     Benefits During Leave. The city will maintain, for up to a maximum of twelve work weeks, any group health insurance coverage that was provided before the leave on the same terms as provided to other employees who become disabled off duty as if the employee had continued to work, if the employee is eligible for concurrent family medical leave, and if the employee has not already exhausted this insurance coverage benefit in the current family medical leave eligibility period. In some instances, the city may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage if an employee does not return to work following pregnancy disability leave.

     An employee on pregnancy disability leave but not receiving continued paid coverage, may continue group health insurance coverage through the city in conjunction with COBRA guidelines by making monthly payments to the city for the amount of the relevant premium. An employee should contact their supervisor for further information.

     D.    Sick and Vacation Leave Accrual. Sick leave and vacation leave cease to accrue at the later of the expiration of pregnancy disability leave/family leave eligibility or when the employee exhausts his or her vacation and sick leave balances.

     E.     Reinstatement. Upon return from an approved pregnancy leave on the original date agreed to, the employee will be immediately reinstated to her original or an equivalent position so long as it was not eliminated for a legitimate business reason. In the event the employee’s original position is no longer available, the employee will be assigned to an open position that is substantially similar in job content, status, pay, promotional opportunities, and geographic location as the employee’s original position.

     If upon return from a pregnancy disability leave an employee is unable to perform the essential functions of her job because of a physical or mental disability, the city will engage in an interactive process with the employee in order to identify a reasonable accommodation that will not cause undue hardship. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

     An employee who is subpoenaed to appear in court in a matter regarding an event or transaction, which he or she perceived or investigated in the course of his or her duty, shall be allowed to do so without loss of compensation.

     An employee subpoenaed to appear in court in a matter unrelated to his or her official capacity as an employee shall be permitted time off without pay, or if the employee chooses, to use accrued vacation for this purpose. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

     A.    Notice And Certification Requirements. Whenever possible, employees should provide advance notice of their military service obligations. This notice may be oral or in writing and may be provided by the employee or by an officer of the military branch in which the employee is serving. Additionally, an employee should submit copies of their military orders, training notices, or induction information. For further information on USERRA, an employee should consult with the human resources department.

     B.     Compensation During Leave. Compensation during military leave is determined as follows:

     2.     Training (Temporary Leave). Any employee who has been employed by the city for at least one year or has a combination of city employment and military service for at least one year is entitled to paid leave for the first thirty calendar days of temporary military leave.

     3.     Temporary and Military Leave in Same Fiscal Year. When an employee has already received thirty calendar days’ paid leave for temporary leave and is called to active duty in the same fiscal year, the employee will receive an additional thirty calendar days’ paid leave for the active duty leave.

     4.     National Guard Members. An employee who is a National Guard member and is on active duty is entitled to paid leave for the first thirty calendar days of duty, regardless of length of city employment.

     5.     Part-Time Employees. Part-time employees subject to paid leave under this section are paid on a prorated basis, depending upon the weekly number of hours they work for the city.

     C.     Status During Leave. An employee on leave under this policy retains his or her seniority and rights and benefits just as if he or she had remained continuously employed by the city. A probationary employee who reinstates with the city after military service is completed resumes his or her probationary period where it left off prior to the leave.

     D.    Benefits During Leave. The city will maintain the employee’s group health insurance coverage for at least twelve work weeks if such insurance was provided before the leave was taken and on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work.

     2.     Training (Temporary Military Leave). An employee on temporary military leave who has at least one year of city employment or at least one year of combined city employment and military service continues to accrue sick, vacation and holiday leave/privileges for up to a maximum of one hundred eighty calendar days while on leave.

     3.     National Guard Members. A National Guard member on military leave is entitled to accrue vacation and holiday leave/privileges but not sick leave for the first thirty calendar days of leave, regardless of length of city employment. A National Guard member on temporary military leave does not accrue sick, vacation or holiday leave/privileges while on leave unless the employee has at least one year of city employment or one year of a combination of city employment and military service.

     F.     Reinstatement. The city will reinstate an employee returning from leave under this policy immediately upon the employee’s request for reinstatement. If the employee’s position has been abolished or has otherwise ceased to exist, the employee shall be reinstated to a position of like seniority, status and pay if such a position exists, or to a comparable position for which he or she is qualified.

     An employee seeking reinstatement after a war or national emergency must request reinstatement within six months of completing his or her service, but no later than six months after the completion of the war or national emergency. An employee who does not request reinstatement within twelve months after the first date that he or she could terminate active service may be denied reinstatement.

     An employee seeking reinstatement after leave not related to a war or national emergency, whose leave is less than thirty-one days, must report to work no later than the beginning of the first full regularly scheduled work period on the first full calendar day following completion of military service. If the employee’s leave was more than thirty days but less than one hundred eighty-one days; the employee must submit an application for reemployment to the city no later than fourteen days after the completion of military service. If the leave is more than one hundred eighty days, such an application must be submitted within ninety days of the completion of military service.

     The city may refuse to reinstate an employee returning from leave under this policy if: (1) the city’s circumstances have so changed that reinstatement is impossible or unreasonable; (2) reinstatement would pose an undue hardship for the city; or (3) the position the employee left was nonrecurring, and there was no expectation of its continuing.

     G.    Retirement Plan Contributions. When the city reemploys an employee returning from leave under this policy, the city will contribute the same amount to the employee’s PERS retirement plan, if applicable, as it would have had the employee not left. An employee who is a PERS member is permitted to spread out any owed contributions for a period of up to three times the length of his or her military leave, but for no more than five years. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.830 Workers’ compensation disability leave.
     The city will grant a workers’ compensation disability leave to employees with occupational illnesses or injuries in accordance with state law. As an alternative, the city will try to reasonably accommodate such employees with modified work when appropriate as provided in Section 2.52.560(F) of this chapter. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.835 Leave of absence.

     A.    Time Off for Parents’ School Activities. If employee is a parent, guardian or grandparent with custody of a child in a licensed day care facility, or kindergarten or grades one through twelve, inclusive, and wishes to take unpaid time off to participate in the activities of the child’s licensed day care facility or school, the employee may take off up to eight hours each calendar month (up to a maximum of forty hours each school year), provided that employee gives reasonable notice to the city of their planned absence.

     B.     School Leave (Suspension). If a school directs an employee who is the parent or guardian of a child who has been suspended from school to attend the child’s school, the employee should alert his or her supervisor as soon as possible. Such time off is unpaid, however an employee may utilize their existing accrued vacation time or floating holiday.

     If both parents of a child work for the city, only one parent, the first to provide notice, may take the time off, unless the city approves both parents taking time off. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.845 Adult literacy leave.
     The city will make reasonable accommodations for any employee who reveals a literacy problem and requests that the city assist him or her in enrolling in an adult literacy program, unless undue hardship to the city would result.

     The city will also assist employees who wish to seek literacy education training by providing employees with the location of local literacy programs.

     While the city generally encourages employees to improve their literacy skills, the city will not reimburse employees for the costs incurred in attending a literacy program. Nonexempt employees may use vacation pay to make up for absences from work to attend literacy classes. Time off to attend classes is unpaid.

     The city will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of any employee who identifies him or herself as an individual with a literacy problem. An employee who wishes to identify him or herself as such an individual can contact the director of human resources directly. Further, individuals who are performing satisfactorily will not be subject to termination of employment or retaliation because they have disclosed literacy problems. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.850 Volunteer firefighters, emergency rescue personnel, and reserve peace officers leaves.
     The city will not discriminate or retaliate against or discharge any employee for taking time off to perform emergency duty as a volunteer firefighter, reserve officer, or other emergency rescue personnel.

     An employee anticipating the need for such leave shall alert his or her supervisor so that he or she may be aware of the fact that an employee may have to take time off for emergency duty. If advance notice is not possible, the employee must notify his or her supervisor as soon as possible. Employees may be required to submit to the city proof of the emergency duties performed. Time off for such duty is unpaid.

     If the employee provides emergency medical or safety services for the city, the city is not required to permit the employee’s leave under this section if doing so would hinder the availability of the employee’s services to the city at a time of need.

     Volunteer firefighters are permitted to take leaves of absence not to exceed an aggregate of fourteen days per calendar year, for the purpose of engaging in fire or law enforcement training. These leaves are unpaid. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.855 Time off to vote.
     The city encourages its employees to participate in the election of government leaders. Therefore, if an employee does not have sufficient time outside their regular work hours to vote, adequate time off may be allowed at the beginning or end of the workday to exercise this right.

     If possible, employees should make their requests at least forty-eight hours in advance of Election Day. The employee may wish to inquire of their registrar of voters about the possibility of voting by absentee ballot. Every effort should be made to vote either before or after the employee’s normal workday. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.860 Time off for victims of violent crimes or domestic abuse.

     Affected employees must give the city reasonable notice that they are required to be absent for a purpose stated above, except for unscheduled or emergency court appearances or other emergency circumstances. In such a case, the city will take no disciplinary action against affected employees if, within a reasonable time after the appearance, they provide the city with documentary evidence that their absence was required for any of the above reasons. To the extent allowed by law, the city will maintain the confidentiality of an employee requesting leave under this section. Leave under this section is unpaid unless employees use accrued time off. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

 

2.52.865 Unapproved leave—AWOL.
     Any absence from work without approved leave shall be grounds for disciplinary action, including, but not limited to, termination of employment.

     The fact that an employee has vacation or sick leave accrued does not preauthorize him or her for leave from work. All leaves must be approved by the employee’s supervisor, department manager or director prior to the actual leave time, except in extenuating circumstances beyond the employee’s control.

     If an employee remains absent without leave for more than three workdays, the city will consider such action a voluntary resignation and may terminate their employment, pursuant to Article IX of this chapter. (Ord. 1072, 2004)

     D.    Procedure. The city’s grievance processes and procedures consist of the following steps:

     1.     Informal Resolution. It is the responsibility of employees who believe they have a bona fide complaint or grievance concerning their terms or conditions of employment to promptly inform and discuss it with their immediate supervisor as designated by the department director or his designee in order to, in good faith, endeavor to resolve the matter expeditiously and informally at the employee-supervisor level.

     If such informal discussion does not resolve the problem to the employee’s satisfaction, and, if the complaint constitutes a grievance as herein defined, the employee may file a formal grievance in accordance with the following procedure.

     a.     Step I (Immediate Supervisor). The employee shall reduce his or her grievance to writing by signing and completing all parts of the grievance form provided by the city, and submits it to his or her immediate supervisor within ten calendar days of the initial commencement of the occurrence being grieved.

     The written grievance shall identify:

     i.      The specific rule, ordinance or regulation violated, misinterpreted, or misapplied;

     ii.     Specific act or omission which gave rise to the alleged violation, misinterpretation, misapplication;

     iii.    The date or dates on which the violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication allegedly occurred;

     iv.    The documents, witnesses or other evidence that support the grievance; and

     v.     The desired solution or remedy.

     The grievant shall provide a copy of the written grievance to his or her immediate supervisor. No grievance shall be accepted for processing until all of the information listed above is provided.

     The supervisor shall further consider and discuss the grievance with the grievant and the grievant’s designated representative as he/she deems appropriate, and shall within ten calendar days of having the written grievance, submit his or her response thereto in writing to the grievant.

     b.     Step II (Department Director). If the written response of the immediate supervisor does not result in a resolution of the grievance, the grievant may appeal the grievance by signing and completing the city form and presenting it to his or her department director within five calendar days of the grievant’s receipt of the supervisor’s response.

     Within ten calendar days of having received the Step II form, the department director shall set a meeting with the grievant, the grievant’s designated representative and such other personnel as he/she deems appropriate to investigate and consider the grievance.

     Within ten calendar days of the meeting, the second level of review shall submit his response to the grievance to the grievant and the grievant’s representative, if any.

     c.     Step III (Division Assistant City Manager). If the written response of the department director does not result in a resolution of the grievance, the grievant may appeal the grievance by signing and completing the city form and presenting it to his or her division assistant city manager within five calendar days of the grievant’s receipt of the department director’s response.

     Within ten calendar days of having received the Step II form, the assistant city manager shall set a meeting with the grievant, the grievant’s designated representative and such other personnel as he/she deems appropriate to investigate and consider the grievance.

     Within ten calendar days of the meeting, the second level of review shall submit his response to the grievance to the grievant and the grievant’s representative, if any.

     d.     Step IV (City Manager’s Office). If the response to the second level of review does not result in resolution of the grievance, the grievant may appeal the grievance by signing and completing the city form and presenting it to the third level of review (designated representative of the city manager’s office) within five calendar days of the grievant’s receipt of the Step II response.

     Within ten calendar days of having received the Step III form, the city manager or his or her designated representative shall set a meeting with the grievant, the grievant’s designated representative and such other personnel as he/she deems appropriate, to consider the grievance.

     Within ten calendar days of the meeting, the third level of review shall submit his or her response to the grievant and the grievant’s representative, if any.

     The city manager may delegate a non-involved department manager to act on behalf of the city manager to render decisions and judgment in these processes. The findings and recommendations they render will be advisory to the city manager whose ultimate decision will be final.

     e.     Step V (Advisory Arbitration). If the response of the third level of review does not result in resolution of the grievance, the grievant may appeal the grievance to the city manager within five calendar days of the grievant’s receipt of the Step III response.

     The parties, or their designated representatives, shall agree on an arbitrator, and if they are unable to agree on an arbitrator within a reasonable time, either party may request the State Conciliation Service to submit to them a list of seven arbitrators who have had experience in the municipal sector. The parties shall select the arbitrator by alternately striking names from said list until one name remains. Such person shall then become the arbitrator.

     The arbitrator so selected shall hold a hearing as expeditiously as possible at a time and at a place convenient to the parties, and shall be bound by the following:

     i.      The arbitrator shall be bound by the language of the memorandum of understanding and the city and departmental rules and regulations consistent therewith in considering any issue properly before him/her.

     ii.     The arbitrator shall expressly confine him/herself to the precise issues submitted to him/her and shall have no authority to consider any other issue not so submitted to him/her.

     iii.    The arbitrator shall be bound by applicable federal, state, and city law.

     iv.    The arbitrator may not recommend changes in established wages or benefits, nor recommend the payment of back wages or benefits to a date prior to ten days before the grievance was timely filed.

     The arbitrator shall submit findings and advisory recommendations to the grievant and the city manager.

     The city manager, within ten calendar days of the receipt of the written findings and recommendations, shall make the final determination of the grievance and submit it in writing to the grievant and his or her designated representative.

     The cost of the arbitrator and other mutually incurred costs shall be borne equally by the parties, unless the city agrees to pay the total costs.

     2.     Time Limits. If the city manager or his or her representatives fail to comply with the time limits specified in subsection D of this section the grievant shall be entitled to appeal to the next level of review.

     Also, failure of the grievant to comply with said time limits shall constitute abandonment of the grievance, except however, that the parties may extend time limits by mutual written agreement in advance.

     3.     Freedom from Retaliation or Reprisal. No employee shall be subject to coercion, disciplinary action, or retaliation for discussing a request or complaint with his or her immediate supervisor, or for filing a grievance petition pursuant to Section 5.25.525 of this chapter.

     4.     Resolution. Any grievance not appealed to the next step in the grievance procedure within the stated time limit shall be considered settled.

     5.     Withdrawal. Any grievance petition may be withdrawn by the grievant at any time, without prejudice.

     Resubmission. Upon consent of the person hearing the grievance petition and the grievant, a grievance may be resubmitted to a lower step in the grievance procedure for reconsideration.

     6.     Employee Representation. An employee may have representation in the preparation and presentation of the grievance at any step in the grievance procedure, except that no supervisor or department manager shall be represented by an employee who he or she may supervise and no employee shall be represented by a supervisor or department manager.

     At least twenty-four hours prior to any meeting convened under the grievance procedure, the employee must notify the city that he or she plans to bring a representative to the meeting, and who the representative will be.

     The grievant employee(s) and one employee representative are entitled to be released from work for a reasonable period of time in order to present the grievance.

     7.     Legitimate Orders. If an employee is given a legitimate order that he or she wishes to grieve, the employee must first comply with the order and file a grievance later unless the assignment endangers the health or safety of the employee or others, or if the requested assignment violates the employee’s constitutional rights.

     1.     An employee organization that seeks formal recognition for purposes of meeting and conferring in good faith as the majority representative of city employees in an appropriate unit shall file a petition with the administrator containing the following information and documentation:

     a.     Name and address of the employee organization;

     b.     Names and titles of its officers;

     c.     Names of employee organization representatives who are authorized to speak on behalf of its members;

     d.     A statement that the employee organization has, as one of its primary purposes, the function of representing employees in their employment relations with the city;

     e.     A statement whether the employee organization is a chapter or local of, or affiliated in any manner with, a regional, state, national or international organization and if so, the name and address of each such regional, state, national or international organization;

     f.      Certified copies of the employee organizations constitution and/or by-laws;

     g.     A designation of those persons, not exceeding two in number, and their addresses, to whom notice sent by they city internal mail system or regular United States mail will be deemed sufficient notice to the employee organization for any purpose;

     h.     A statement that the employee organization has no restriction on membership based on race, color, creed, sex, age over forty (40), national origin, disability, sexual orientation or any other category protected by state and/or federal law;

     i.      The job classifications or titles of employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate and the approximate number of member employees therein;

     j.      A statement that the employee organization has in its possession written proof, dated within six months of the date upon which the petition is filed, currently effective or a payroll dues deduction authorization to establish that city employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate have designated the employee organization to represent them in their employment relations with the city. Such written proof shall be submitted for confirmation to a mutually agreed upon disinterested third party;

     k.     A request that the city recognize the employee organization as the majority representative of the member employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate for the purpose of meeting and conferring in good faith on all matters within the scope of representation; and

     l.      The petition including all accompanying documents shall be verified, under oath, by the elected officers of the employee organization that the statements are true. All changes in such information shall be filed with the administrator forthwith in like manner.

     2.     The petition shall be accompanied by written proof that at least thirty percent (30%) of the employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate have designated the employee organization to represent them in their employment relations with the city, provided, however, the employee organization may request that such written proof be submitted to a mutually agreed upon disinterested third party. Upon receipt of the petition for recognition, the city shall determine whether:

     a.     There has been compliance with the requirements of the petition for recognition; and

     b.     The proposed unit is an appropriate unit.

     If the city affirms the foregoing two matters, the administrator shall give notice of such request for formal recognition to appropriate city employees in the unit and shall take no action on said request for twenty (20) days thereafter. If either of the foregoing matters is not determined affirmatively, the administrator shall inform the employee organization of the reasons therefore in writing.

     3.     Within twenty (20) days of the date notice to employees is given, any other employee organization (hereinafter referred to as the “challenging organization”) may seek formal recognition in an overlapping unit by filing a petition for recognition; provided, however, such challenging organization must submit written proof that it represents at least thirty percent (30%) of the employees in such unit. The administrator shall hold a hearing on such overlapping petitions, at which time all affected employee organizations shall be heard. Thereafter, the administrator shall determine the appropriate unit or units as between such proposed overlapping units in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section 2.53.100 of this chapter.

     4.     If the written proof submitted by the employee organization in the unit found to be appropriate establishes that it represents more than fifty percent (50%) of the employees in such unit, the city may, in its discretion, grant formal recognition to such employee organization without a secret ballot election. The city shall not grant such formal recognition without a secret ballot election, however, in the event written proof is submitted by another employee organization that establishes that it represents more than thirty percent (30%) of the employees in the unit found to be appropriate.

     5.     When an employee organization submits written proof that it represents at least thirty percent (30%) of the employees in the unit found to be appropriate, but it does not qualify for or has not been granted recognition pursuant to subsection (B)(4) of this section, the city shall arrange for a secret ballot election to be conducted by the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service or some agreed upon third party. All challenging organizations that have submitted written proof that they represent at least ten percent (10%) of the employees in the unit found to be appropriate and have submitted a petition for recognition as required by this section shall be included on the ballot. Employees entitled to vote in such election shall be those persons regularly employed in positions within the unit found appropriate who were employed during the last full pay period immediately preceding fifteen (15) days before the election, including those who did not work during such period because of illness, vacation or authorized leaves of absence and who are employed by the city in the same unit on the date of the election. The city representatives shall upon written request of any employee organization to be involved in such election, consult with said employee organization with respect to the procedures for conducting such election and shall allow any such employee organization to maintain an observer at the balloting site or sites upon specific request of said employee organization. An employee organization shall be granted formal recognition following an election or run-off election if it receives more than fifty percent (50%) of all valid votes cast by eligible voters When none of the choices receives a majority of the valid votes cast in an election involving three or more choices, a run-off election shall be conducted between the two choices receiving the largest number of valid votes cast. The rules governing an initial election shall also apply to a run-off election.

     6.     There shall be no more than one valid election in a twelve (12)-month period within the same unit.

     C.     Decertification of Established Unit.

     1.     A petition for decertification alleging that an employee organization granted formal recognition is no longer the majority representative of the employees in an appropriate unit may be filed with the city only during the months of October through December of each year following the first full year of formal recognition (e.g., for an employee organization granted formal recognition between December 1 , 2002 and September 30, 2003, a petition for decertification may not be filed until October 1, 2003). The petition for decertification may be filed by an employee, a group of employees or their representative, or an employee organization. The petition, including all accompanying documents, shall be verified under oath by the person signing it that its contents are true. It may be accompanied by a petition for recognition by a challenging organization. The petition for decertification shall contain the following information:

     a.     The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner and a designated representative authorized to receive notices or requests for further information;

     b.     The name of the formally recognized employee organization;

     c.     An allegation that the formally recognized employee organization no longer represents a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit, and any other relevant and material facts; and

     d.     Written proof that at least thirty percent (30%) of the employees in the unit do not desire to be represented by the formally recognized employee organization. Such written proof shall be dated within six months of the date upon which the petition is filed and shall be submitted for confirmation to the city or to a mutually agreed upon disinterested third party.

     2.     The city shall arrange for a secret ballot election to determine if the formally recognized employee organization shall retain recognition. The formally recognized employee organization shall be decertified if a numerical majority of all the employees eligible to vote in the unit in question vote for decertification.

     3.     There shall be no more than one valid decertification election in the same unit in any twelve (12) month period.

     D.    Duration of Formal Recognition. When an employee organization has been formally recognized, as provided herein, such recognition shall remain in effect for one year from the date thereof and thereafter until such time as the city shall determine on the basis of a secret ballot election conducted in accordance with the foregoing rules, that the formally recognized employee organization no longer represents a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit. While formal recognition is in effect, the city will provide to formally recognized organizations in the units that each such organization represents the names and working units of all employees hired and the names of all employees whose employment is terminated. Such lists will be supplied to the appropriate organization by the 15th of the month following the hire or termination.

     E.     Cost of Election Proceedings. The cost of any election proceeding shall be borne by the employee organization or organizations whose name(s) appear on the ballot. Prior to any such election proceeding the employee organization or organizations whose name(s) appear on the ballot shall make arrangements acceptable to the city for payment of the cost of said election proceedings. The city may permit the employee organization to use city facilities and supplies to distribute information to its members.

     F.     Impasses in Representation Proceedings. Any unresolved complaint by an affected employee organization, advanced in good faith, concerning a decision of the city made pursuant to subsections (A), (B), (C) or (D) of this section shall be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.53.130 of this chapter, provided, however, the written request for an impasse meeting, as described in Section 2.53.130, must be filed with the administrator within seven calendar days after the affected employee organization first received notice of the decision upon which its complaint is based, or its complaint will be considered closed and not subject to the impasse procedures or to any other appeal.

     G.    Informal Recognition—Having The Right to Consult in Good Faith. An employee organization that seeks recognition for purposes of consultation in good faith shall file a petition with the Administrator containing the following information and documentation:

     1.     All of the information enumerated in subsections (B)(1)(a) through (B)(1)(j) inclusive, and as required by subsection (B)(1)(l) of this section.

     2.     A statement that the employee organization has in its possession written proof, dated within six months of the date upon which the petition is filed to establish that employees have designated the employee organization to represent them in their employment relations with the city. Such written proof shall be submitted for confirmation to the administrator or to a mutually agreed upon disinterested third party.

     3.     A request that the city recognize the employee organization for the purpose of consultation in good faith.

     H.    Granting of Recognition. The city shall grant recognition, in writing, to all employee organizations that have complied with either subsection (B) or subsection (G) of this section for purposes of consultation in good faith for the organizations employee members. An employee organization seeking formal recognition as majority representative must, in addition, establish to the satisfaction of the city that it represents a majority of the employees in the manner prescribed in subsection (B)(4) or (B)(5) of this section. No employee may be represented by more than one recognized employee organization for the purpose of meeting and conferring with the city representatives. (Ord. 1042 § 9, 2003)

 

2.53.100 Appropriate unit.
     A.    The city, after reviewing the petition filed by an employee organization seeking formal recognition as majority representative, shall determine whether the proposed unit is an appropriate unit. The principal criterion in making this determination is whether there is a community of interest among such employees. The following factors, among others, shall be considered in making such determination:

     1.     Which unit will assure employees the fullest freedom in the exercise of rights set forth in this chapter;

     2.     The history of employee relations: (i) in the unit; (ii) among other employees of the city; and (iii) in similar public employment;

     3.     The effect of the unit on the efficient operation of the city and sound employer-employee relations;

     4.     The extent to which employees have common skills, working conditions, job duties or similar educational requirements; and

     5.     The effect on the existing classification structure of dividing a single classification among two or more units.

     No unit shall be established solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized.

     B.     In the establishment of appropriate units:

     1.     Professional employees shall not be denied the right to be represented separately from nonprofessional employees. (Note: there is at least one case that says each profession is entitled to its own bargaining unit if it desires.);

     2.     Management and confidential employees shall not represent any employee organization on matters within the scope of representation when such employee organization represents other employees of the city; and

     3.     Management and confidential employees shall not be included for purposes of representation in the same units as non-management and non-confidential employees. (Ord. 1042 § 10, 2003)

 

2.53.110 Designation of city representatives.
     The city manager, and/or his or her designee shall be the city's principal representatives in all matters of employer-employee relations, with authority to meet and confer in good faith on matters within the scope of representation, including wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. (Ord. 1042 § 11, 2003)

 

2.53.120 Reasonable time off to meet and confer.
     A.    The city shall allow a reasonable number of employee representatives of recognized employee organizations reasonable time off without loss of compensation or other benefits when formally meeting and conferring with representatives of the city on matters within the scope of representation. Where circumstances warrant, the city representatives may approve the attendance at such meetings of additional employee representatives with or without loss of compensation. The employee organization shall, whenever practicable, submit the names of all such employee representatives to the city representatives at least two working days in advance of such meetings, provided that:

     1.     No employee representative shall leave his or her duty or work station or assignment without specific approval of the department head or other authorized city management official; and

     2.     Any such meeting is subject to scheduling by city management and the employee organization in a manner consistent with operating requirements and work schedules.

     B.     Nothing provided herein shall limit or restrict city management and employee organizations from scheduling such meetings before or after regular duty or work hours under appropriate circumstances. (Ord. 1042 § 12, 2003)

 

2.53.130 Impasse procedures.
     A.    Impasse procedures may be invoked only after the possibility of settlement by direct discussion has been exhausted.

     B.     The impasse procedures that may be invoked to resolve the impasse include the following:

     1.     Mediation (or conciliation) as defined in Section 2.53.030. All mediation proceedings shall be conducted confidentially. The mediator shall make no public recommendations nor take any public position concerning the issues;

     2.     Determination by the city council after a hearing on the merits of the dispute; and

     3.     Any other dispute resolving procedures to which the parties mutually agree or which the city may order.

     C.     Any party may initiate the impasse procedure by filing with the other party (or parties) affected a written request for an impasse meeting together with a statement of its position on all disputed issues. An impasse meeting may then be scheduled by the city's representatives within a reasonable time after the date of filing of the written request for such meeting with written notice to all parties affected. The purpose of such impasse meeting is twofold:

     1.     To permit a review of the position of all parties in a final effort to reach agreement on the disputed issues; and

     2.     If agreement is not concluded, to mutually select the specific impasse procedure to which the dispute may be submitted.

     D.    In the event the parties select mediation, a mediator shall be selected who is mutually agreeable to the parties, provided that if the parties cannot agree upon the choice of mediator, a list of seven impartial mediators shall be obtained from the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service, and each party shall alternatively strike one name from the list until only one name remains, the first party to strike having been chosen by lot. In the absence of agreement between the parties on the impasse procedure to follow, the matter may be referred to the Public Employment Relations Board.

     E.     The fees and expenses, if any, of mediation or of any other impasse procedure, shall be payable one-half by the city and one-half by the employee organization or employee organizations. (Ord. 1042 § 13, 2003)

 

2.53.140 Memorandum of understanding.
     A.    When the meeting and conferring process is concluded between the city representatives and a formally recognized employee organization representing a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit, all agreed-upon matters shall be incorporated in a written memorandum of understanding, which shall be advisory to the city council, signed by the city manager and the majority representatives.

     B.     The memorandum of understanding shall be submitted to the city council for final determination and adoption. (Ord. 1042 § 14, 2003)

 

2.53.150 Dues check-off.
     A.    Only a formally recognized employee organization (i.e., the majority representative of employees in an appropriate unit) may be granted permission by the city to have the regular dues or other authorized employee organization charges of its members deducted from their paychecks, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the city.

     B.     Dues deduction shall be for a specified amount and shall be made only upon the voluntary written authorization of the member. Dues deduction authorization may be canceled and the dues check-off payroll discontinued at any time by the member upon voluntary written notice to the city. Dues deduction authorization or cancellation shall be made available upon forms developed by the city and the recognized employee organization and provided by the city. Dues deduction may be continued only upon voluntary written authorization of the member.

     C.     Should any employee choose not to join the majority representative employee organization and therefore not render periodic dues and charges, the employee may be required to render an agency fee as delineated in Sections 1157.7, 3502.5 and 3508.5 of the Government Code of the State of California, if required by the terms of a memorandum of understanding between the city and the majority representative. Terms requiring an agency shop may be agreed upon only when a secret ballot election held separately for each represented group confirms that a majority of the represented employees voting agrees to an agency shop. Such election will be held by a process supervised by a neutral third party such as the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service. There shall be no more than one valid agency shop election in the same unit in any twelve (12) month period. An agency shop arrangement shall not apply to managerial, confidential or supervisory employees.

     D.    The employees earnings must be regularly sufficient after other legal and required deductions are made to cover the amount of any dues check-off authorized. When a member in good standing of the formally recognized employee organization is in a non-paid status for an entire pay period, no dues withholding shall be made to cover that pay period from future earnings nor shall the member deposit the amount with the city which would have been withheld if the member had been in paid status during that period. If an employee is in a non-paid status during only a part of the pay period but the earnings are not sufficient to cover the full withholding, no deduction shall be made. All other legal and required deductions shall have priority over employee organization dues.

     E.     Dues or other charges withheld by the city shall be transmitted to the officer or organization designated in writing by the employee organization as the person or organization authorized to receive such funds, at the address specified.

     F.     All employee organizations who receive dues check-off shall indemnify, defend, and hold the city and its officers and employees harmless against any claims made and against any suit instituted against the city on account of check-off of employee organization dues, including but not limited to all costs of defending against any such claims or suits. In addition, all such employee organizations shall refund to the city any amounts paid to them in error upon presentation of supporting documentation or other evidence. (Ord. 1042 § 15, 2003)

 

2.53.160 Access to work locations.
     Reasonable access to employee work locations shall be granted officers of the recognized employee organizations and their officially designated representatives, for the purpose of processing grievances or contacting members of the organization concerning business within the scope of representation. The officers or representatives shall not enter any work locations without proper notification to the designated representative of the city access shall be restricted so as not to unduly interfere with the normal operations of the city or with established safety or security requirements. (Ord. 1042 § 16, 2003)

 

2.53.170 Use of bulletin boards.
     Recognized employee organizations may use designated portions of city bulletin boards under the same procedures applicable to the posting of other business-related items at the city of Palm Desert. (Ord. 1042 § 17, 2003)

 

2.53.180 Availability of data.
     A.    The city shall make available to employee organizations such non-confidential information pertaining to employment relations as is contained in the public records of the city subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this chapter and Government Code Sections 6250—6260.

     B.     Such information shall be made available during regular office hours in accordance with the city’s rules and procedures for making public records available and after payment of reasonable costs.

     C.     Information that shall be made available to employee organizations includes regularly published data covering subjects under discussion. Data collected on a promise to keep its source confidential may be made available in statistical summaries, but shall not be made available in such form as to disclose the source.

     D.    Nothing in this rule shall be construed to require disclosure of records that are:

     1.     Personnel, medical and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

     2.     Working papers or memoranda that are not retained in the ordinary course of business or any records when the public interest served by not making the record available clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record; or

     3.     Records pertaining to pending litigation to which the city is a party, or to claims or appeals that have not been settled.

     E.     Nothing in this rule shall be construed to require the city to do research for an inquirer or to do programming or to assemble data in a manner or to an extent other than usually done by the city. (Ord. 1042 § 18, 2003)

 

2.53.190 Peaceful performance of service.
     A.    It is the policy of the city to promote employer-employee relations, maintain full communication between the city and its employees and recognize the right of employees to join organizations of their own choice and be represented by recognized employee organizations, as provided herein.

     B.     It is also the policy of the city that all services, operation of facilities and functions of the city shall be performed in a peaceful, orderly, expeditious and lawful manner. Significant disruption of the services provided by the city could create a substantial and imminent threat to the health or safety of the public located in the city of Palm Desert.

     C.     Consistent with applicable law, any employee who encourages, causes or participates in any strike, walkout, stoppage, retarding of work, concerted failure to report for work, or any other interference with conduct of the city’s operations that creates a substantial and imminent threat to public health and safety, shall be subject to immediate disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

     D.    In addition to the above provision prohibiting actions creating a substantial and imminent threat to public health and safety, no employee or employee organization shall engage in any strike, picketing, or other concerted refusal to work without not less than ten days prior to such action, notifying the city and the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service (SMCS) in writing of that intention. The notice shall state the date and time that such action will commence. The notice, once given, may be extended by the written agreement of both parties. (Ord. 1042 § 19, 2003)

 

2.53.200 Construction.
     A.    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to deny any person or employee the rights granted by federal and State laws.

     B.     The rights, powers, duties and authority of the city in all matters, including the right to maintain any legal action, shall not be modified or restricted by this chapter.

     C.     The provisions of this chapter are not intended to conflict with, but rather to carry out, the provisions of Chapter 10, Division 4, Title I of the Government Code of the State of California (Sections 3500, et seq.). (Ord. 1042 § 20, 2003)

 

2.53.210 Amendments.
     This chapter shall be subject to amendment by ordinance passed at stated meetings of the city council, or upon previous notice of the intention to so amend said chapter, at a special meeting called for such purpose and after consultation in good faith as required by Section 3507 of the Government Code of the State of California. (Ord. 1042 § 21, 2003)

 

2.53.220 Separability.
     If any provision of this chapter, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, shall be held invalid, the remainder of this chapter, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby. (Ord. 1042 § 22, 2003)

Chapter 2.56 CONFLICT OF INTEREST CODE
2.56.010 Code adopted.
     The terms of Title 2, California Administrative Code Section 18730 and any amendments to it duly adopted by the Fair Political Practices Commission are hereby incorporated by reference and, along with Appendixes A and B attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter in which officials and employees are designated and disclosure categories are set forth, constitute the conflict of interest code of the city of Palm Desert.

     B.     To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance as codified in this chapter which incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

     C.     To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance as codified in this chapter which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the state sales and use taxes;

     D.    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance as codified in this chapter which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 7 § 3, 1973)

 

3.24.040 Contract with state.
     Prior to the operative date the city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if the city has not contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following November 26, 1973. (Ord. 7 § 4, 1973)

 

3.24.050 Sales tax.
     For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail a tax is imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in Section 3.24.020 of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in the city on and after November 26, 1973.

3.24.060 Place of sale.
     For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated, shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. (Ord. 7 § 6, 1973)

3.24.090 Limitations on adoption of state law.
     In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, wherever the state is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of the city shall be substituted therefor. The substitution, however shall not be made when the word “state” is used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or the Constitution of the state; the substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city or any agency thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter; the substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the provisions of that Code; the substitution shall not be made in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797, or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; and the substitution shall not be made for the word “state” in the phrase “retailer engaged in business in this state” in Section 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.

Chapter 3.28 TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX
3.28.010 Short title.
     The short title of this chapter is the “uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance.” (Ord. 6 § 1, 1973)

 

3.28.020 Definitions.
     Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter:

     A.    “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for use or occupancy by transients, including, but not limited to dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, time-share project or facility, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, recreational vehicle or other similar structure or portion thereof, including a “short-term rental unit” as defined in Chapter 5.10.

     B.     “Occupancy” means the use or possession of any hotel room, rooms or any portion thereof offered for rent for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes regardless of the actual purpose for which such rooms are rented or provided.

     C.     “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, time-share project or facility manager or operator, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his, her or its functions through a managing agent of any type or character, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter, and shall have jointly and severally the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

     D.    “Rent” means the consideration charged or chargeable to a transient for the occupancy of space, including, without any limitation: (1) any unrefundable rental deposits; or (2) separate charges whether received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including charges for rollaway beds, cribs and any other equipment necessary and required for ordinary lodging or sleeping purposes. Rent taxable and reportable pursuant to this chapter shall not be reduced by the actual or perceived value of any hotel amenities provided to transients without additional charge, such as complimentary continental breakfasts, cocktails and newspapers. Rent may have been payable, in whole or in part, prior to or following the occupancy to which it is attributable, and may have been paid in advance on a long-term basis. It is not the intent of this section to make the operator liable for the tax on uncollected rent. However, uncollected rent must be reported.

     E.     “Tax administrator” means the director of finance, or such other individual as may be designated by the city council.

     F.     “Time-share occupancy” means occupancy of a time-share estate, as that term is defined in Business and Professions Code Section 11212, by someone other than the owner of the time-share estate or his or her nonpaying guests.

     G.    “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy of the hotel by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or by reason of the timeshare estate under a rental agreement with its owner or due to “bonus use” for a period of thirty consecutive calendar nights or less. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty nights has expired. Unless nights of occupancy by one person are consecutive without any break, then prior or subsequent periods of such occupancy shall not be counted when determining whether a period exceeds the thirty consecutive nights.

     H.    “Exchange user” means an owner of a time period in another time-sharing program who changes occupancy periods in his or her own property for time periods in projects in other locations.

     I.      “Bonus use” means occupation of a time-share estate by one of its owners beyond that owner’s actual ownership share of time, accomplished through rental of another owner’s share of time in the same time-share unit. (Ord. 1261 § 1, 2013; Ord. 1236 § 1, 2012; Ord. 1127 § 1, 2006; Ord. 753 § 1, 1994; Ord. 725 § 1, 1993; Ord. 649 §§ 1, 2, 1991; Ord. 280 § 1, 1981; Ord. 134 §§ 1, 2, 1976; Ord. 6 § 2, 1973)

 

3.28.030 Tax imposed.
     For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of eleven percent of the rent charged by the operator or otherwise payable by the transient. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city.

     For purposes of this section, the rent deemed payable on account of occupancy of a time-share estate shall be the rent charged or otherwise payable to the time-share estate owner by a lessee of the time-share estate. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due when the transient ceases to occupy space in the hotel or time-share. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel or time-share, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. Tax on occupancies in exchange for services of any kind is due and payable to the city by the operator, the amount of tax being determined on the basis of eleven percent of the current rental value of the accommodations furnished. (Ord. 1307 § 1, 2016; Ord. 1071 § 2, 2004; Ord. 679 § 1, 1992; Ord. 649 § 3, 1991; Ord. 547 § 1, 1988; Ord. 280 § 2, 1981; Ord. 6 § 3, 1973)

 

3.28.040 Exemptions.
     A.    No tax shall be imposed upon:

     1.     Any occupancy of a time-share estate by its owner, his or her nonpaying guest, or an exchange user;

     2.     Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business, provided the room is booked and paid for directly by the federal or state government;

     3.     Any person as to whom or any occupancy as to which it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax provided in this chapter;

     4.     Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty;

     5.     Complimentary rooms provided at no charge and not in exchange for services to employees, entertainers, nonprofit charitable organizations, or to a transient for promotional purposes are exempt. This exemption will not apply if the complimentary rooms are subrented for a fee by a group or person receiving the complimentary rooms.

     B.     Any exemption claimed pursuant to subsection A of this section must be fully itemized and explained on the return or a supporting schedule.

     C.     Persons renting single family dwellings, condominiums, apartments or similar use units on a monthly term regardless of the nights contained in the month shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1261 § 2, 2013; Ord. 940 § 1, 2000; Ord. 682 §1, 1992; Ord. 649 § 4, 1991; Ord. 418 § 1, 1985; Ord. 6 § 4, 1973)

 

3.28.050 Operator’s duties.
     Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of the tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator; or that it will not be added to the rent; or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. (Ord. 6 § 5, 1973)

 

3.28.060 Registration.
     A.    Every person desiring to engage in or conduct business as operator of a hotel renting to transients within the city shall file with the tax administrator an application for a transient occupancy registration permit for each place of business. Every application for such a permit shall be made upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator and shall set forth the name under which the applicant transacts or intends to transact business, the location of his or her place of business and such other information as the tax administrator may require. The application shall be signed by the owner if a natural person, by a member or partner, if an association or partnership, by an executive officer or some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the application in the case of a corporation. The transient occupancy registration permit must be in effect at all times while the business is in operation and shall be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The permit shall, among other things, state the following:

     2.     Name of operator;

     3.     Hotel address;

     4.     The date upon which the permit was issued;

     5.     “This Transient Occupancy Registration Permit signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Chapter by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This permit does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business in an unlawful manner, nor operate a hotel without strictly complying with all applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This permit does not apply in lieu of such other permits which are otherwise required.”

     B.     At the time of making an application for a registration permit, the applicant shall pay registration fee of five dollars for each permit issued. (Ord. 6 § 6, 1973)

 

3.28.070 Returns and payment.
     A.    The tax imposed under Section 3.28.030 is due and payable to the tax administrator, on the first day of the month following the close of each calendar month and becomes delinquent on the first day of the second succeeding calendar month following the close of each calendar month.

     B.     Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar month, or shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, complete a monthly transient occupancy tax form provided by the tax administrator of the total rents charged or chargeable as provided in Section 3.28.030, whether or not received, including any rentals charged for occupancies exempt under the provisions of Sections 3.28.020 through 3.28.040, and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the tax—fixed at the rate of eleven percent of the amounts of rentals charged or chargeable which are not exempt from tax under Sections 3.28.020, 3.28.040 and 3.28.120—shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods and may require a cash deposit or bond for any permit holder, if he deems it necessary, to insure collection of the tax, and he may require further information in the return. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator.

     C.     Each operator shall notify the tax administrator, ten days prior to the sale or cessation of business for any reason and returns and payments are due immediately upon the sale or cessation of business.

3.28.080 Penalties, interests and costs.
     A.    Any operator who fails to pay any tax to the city or any amount of tax required to be collected and paid to the city including amounts based on determinations made by the tax administrator under Section 3.28.090, within the time required, shall pay a penalty of ten percent of tax plus interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the date on which the tax or the amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable to the city until the date of payments.

     B.     An operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay accumulative penalties and interest compounded on a monthly basis, until the delinquent remittance or payment is paid in full, provided the amount of such penalties shall in no event exceed fifty percent of the amount of tax due, and interest shall not exceed twelve percent of the tax due.

     C.     If the tax administrator determines that nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of one hundred percent of this amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsection A of this section.

     D.    In the event the tax administrator or the city has expended funds by the use of auditor or any other individual necessary in the review and collection, all of such costs and expenses of the city shall be added to the tax when due in addition to the interest and penalties thereon. (Ord. 375 § 2, 1984; Ord. 340 § 1, 1983; Ord. 6 § 8, 1973)

 

3.28.090 Failure to collect and report tax.
     A.    If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make within the time provided in this chapter any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he deems best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known address.

     B.     The operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed in this chapter to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this chapter of the determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be so due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.28.100. (Ord. 6 § 9, 1973)

 

3.28.100 Appeal.
     Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of any tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving of the assessment or termination of tax and penalties, if any, due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to the operator at his last known address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in Section 3.28.090 for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 6 § 10, 1973)

 

3.28.110 Records.
     It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records necessary to determine the amount of any such tax. The tax administrator or city auditors shall have the right to inspect these records at all reasonable times and may subpoena the records of any operator who refuses to make them available for examination. Such records shall be maintained at the operator’s premises or shall be available for delivery to the tax administrator within one week after request. The records shall include at least the following information:

     A.    Daily summaries of room occupancies; and

     B.     A record of each occupancy charge for which an exemption is claimed, including the name of the individual occupying the room, dates of occupancy, and reasons for exemption; and

     C.     Lists of bad debts claimed for exemptions including names and addresses of debtor and amount of room rent unpaid. (Ord. 649 § 6, 1991; Ord. 6 § 11, 1973)

 

3.28.120 Refunds.
     A.    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section; provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claims shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.

     B.     An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent, subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

     C.     A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

     D.    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records. (Ord. 6 § 12, 1973)

 

3.28.130 Actions to collect.
     The remedies set forth in Sections 3.28.140 through 3.28.210 shall be applicable to preexisting tax debts provided for in this chapter. (Ord. 6 § 13, 1973)

 

3.28.140 Revocation of permit.
     A.    Whenever any operator fails to comply with any provision of this chapter relating to occupancy tax or any rule or regulation of the tax administrator relating to occupancy tax prescribed and adopted under this chapter, the tax administrator, upon hearing, after giving the operator ten days notice in writing specifying the time and place of hearing and requiring him to show cause why his permit or permits should not be revoked, may suspend or revoke any one or more of the permits held by the operator.

     B.     The tax administrator shall give to the operator written notice of the suspension or revocation of any of his permits. The notices required in this section may be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination.

     C.     The tax administrator shall not issue a new permit after the revocation of a permit unless he is satisfied that the former holder of the permit will comply with the provisions of this chapter relating to the occupancy tax and regulation of the tax administrator. During the period of time while such a permit is suspended, revoked or otherwise not validly in effect, the tax administrator may require that the operation be closed. (Ord. 6 § 13 (A), 1973)

 

3.28.150 Recording certificate—Lien.
     A.    If any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter is not paid when due, the tax administrator may, within three years after the amount is due, file for record in the office of the Riverside County recorder a certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due, the name and address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the operator liable for the same and the fact that the tax administrator has complied with all provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount required to be paid.

     B.     From the time of the filing for record, the amount required to be paid together with penalties and interest constitutes a lien upon all real property in the county owned by the operator or afterwards and before the lien expires acquired by him. The lien has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten years from the time of filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. (Ord. 6 § 13 (B), 1973)

 

3.28.160 Priority and lien of tax.
     A.    The amounts required to be paid by any operator under this chapter with penalties and interest shall be satisfied first in any of the following cases:

     1.     Whenever the person is insolvent;

     2.     Whenever the person makes a voluntary assignment of his assets;

     3.     Whenever the estate of the person in the hands of executors, administrators, or heirs is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased;

     4.     Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent person required to pay any amount under this chapter are levied upon process law. This chapter does not give the city a preference over any recorded lien which attached prior to the date when the amounts required to be paid became a lien.

     B.     The preference given to the city by this section shall be subordinate to the preferences given to claims for personal services by Sections 1204 and 1206 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Ord. 6 § 13 (C), 1973)

 

3.28.170 Warrant for collection of tax.
     At any time within three years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount required in this chapter to be paid or within three years after the last recording of a certificate under Section 3.28.140, the tax administrator may issue a warrant for the enforcement of any liens and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter. The warrant shall be directed to any sheriff, marshal or constable and shall have the same effect as a writ of execution. The warrant shall be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same manner and with the same effect as a levy of and a sale pursuant to a writ of execution. The tax administrator may pay or advance to the sheriff, marshal or constable, the same fees, commissions and expenses for his services pursuant to a writ of execution. The tax administrator, and not the court, shall approve the fees for publication in a newspaper. (Ord. 6 § 13 (D), 1973)

 

3.28.180 Seizure and sale.
     At any time within three years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount, the tax administrator may forthwith collect the amount in the following manner: The tax administrator shall seize any property, real or personal, of the operator and sell the property, or a sufficient part of it, at public auction to pay the amount due together with any penalties and interest imposed for the delinquency and any costs incurred on account of the seizure and sale. Any seizure made to collect occupancy taxes due shall be only of property of the operator not exempt from execution under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Ord. 6 § 13 (E), 1973)

 

3.28.190 Successor’s liability—Withholding by purchaser.
     If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells out his business or quits the business, his successor or assigns shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the tax administrator showing that it has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. (Ord. 6 § 13 (F), 1973)

 

3.28.200 Liability of purchaser—Release.
     If the purchaser of a hotel fails to withhold purchase price as required, he shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within sixty days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, or within sixty days from the date the former owner’s records are made available for audit, whichever period expires the later, but in any event not later than ninety days after receiving the request, the tax administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the tax administrator to mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold purchase price as above provided. The time within which the obligation of the successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells his business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs later. (Ord. 6 § 13 (G), 1973)

 

3.28.210 Responsibility for payment.
     Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by the operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the discovery of such amount. (Ord. 6 § 13 (H), 1973)

 

3.28.220 Extension of time.
     The tax administrator, for good cause, may extend for not to exceed one month the time for making any return or paying any amount, required to be paid under this chapter. The extension may be granted at any time, provided a request therefor is filed with the tax administrator within or prior to the period for which the extension may be granted. Any person to whom an extension is granted shall pay one percent per month or fraction thereof from the date on which the tax would have been due without the extension until the date of payment. (Ord. 6 § 15, 1973)

 

3.28.230 Divulging of information forbidden.
     It is unlawful for any person having an administrative duty under this chapter to make known in any manner whatever the business affairs, operation, or information obtained by an investigation or the records of any operator or any other person visited or examined in the discharge of official duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures, or any particular thereof set forth or disclosed in any return, or to knowingly permit any return or copy thereof to be seen or examined by any person. Successors, receivers, trustees, executors, administrators, assignees and guarantors, if directly interested, may be given information as to the items included in the amounts of any unpaid tax or amounts of tax, penalties and interest required to be collected. (Ord. 6 § 16, 1973)

 

3.28.240 Joint agreement.
     The city is empowered to enter into a joint powers agreement with other cities and the county, and if such agreement or agreements can be made wherein central collection for the county is provided, then it shall be done upon approval by the city council. (Ord. 6 § 18, 1973)

     Any operator or other person who wilfully fails or refuses to register as required in this chapter, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as set out in Chapter 1.12. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who wilfully makes a false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as set out in Chapter 1.12. (Ord. 134 § 3, 1976; Ord. 6 § 14, 1973)

 

3.28.260 City attorney action—Court costs.
     The city attorney may, on behalf of the city, take all appropriate legal action in order to collect such debts owing to the city, and may commence, or defend, in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction, an action or actions relating to any amount due from operators collecting transient occupancy taxes, including penalties, interest and deficit taxes, revealed by audits.

The city will provide a written decision to the protestor in a reasonable amount of time.

     The procedure and time limits set forth are mandatory and are the sole and exclusive remedy in the event of a bid protest.

     j.      When there has been no bid shopping.

     Prior to approval of the prime contractor’s request for the substitution, the city shall give notice in writing to the listed subcontractor of the prime contractor’s request to substitute and of the reasons for the request. The notice shall be served by certified or registered mail to the last known address of the subcontractor. The listed subcontractor who has been so notified shall have five working days within which to submit written objections to the substitution to the city. Failure to file these written objections shall constitute the listed subcontractor’s consent to the substitution.

     If written objections are filed, the city shall give notice in writing of at least five working days to the listed subcontractor of a hearing by the city on the prime contractor’s request for substitution.

     2.     Permit a subcontract to be voluntarily assigned or transferred or allow it to be performed by anyone other than the original subcontractor listed in the original bid, without the consent of the city.

     Any listed subcontractor who has been notified by the prime contractor in accordance with this section as to an inadvertent clerical error shall be allowed six working days from the time of the prime bid opening within which to submit to the city and to the prime contractor written objection to the prime contractor’s claim of inadvertent clerical error. Failure of the listed subcontractor to file the written notice within the six working days shall be primary evidence of his or her agreement that an inadvertent clerical error was made.

     The city may, after a public hearing and in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, consent to the substitution of the intended subcontractor.

     F.     Subletting or Subcontracting Portion in Excess of Certain Percent of Prime Contractor’s Total Bid to Which No Subcontractor was Designated in Original Bid. Subletting or subcontracting of any portion of the work in excess of one-half of one percent of the prime contractor’s total bid as to which no subcontractor was designated in the original bid shall only be permitted in cases of public emergency or necessity, and then only after a finding reduced to writing as a public record of the city setting forth the facts constituting the emergency or necessity.

In addition, the preferences established in this section shall in no way be construed to prohibit the right of the city council or the purchasing officer from giving any other preference permitted by law or this chapter.

Chapter 3.45 CHILDCARE FACILITIES IMPACT MITIGATION FEE
3.45.010 Purpose, use and findings.
     The city council finds and determines as follows:

     A.    As recognized by both state and local law, child care has become an increasingly important community service that is difficult for many families to secure due to lack of available facilities and spaces and/or because of cost. Good quality child care services are an essential service for working parents and such child care facilities can contribute positively to a child’s emotional, cognitive and educational development. The state has acknowledged the need for quality child care facilities in both the Health and Safety Code and the Government Code. Similarly, the city’s general plan states that the city should encourage the availability of adequate, convenient, affordable child care that is accessible to all economic segments of the community.

     B.     The purpose of this chapter is to create a child care facilities impact mitigation fee that will apply to new, nonresidential development in the city. This fee will further the public health, safety and welfare by funding the construction of needed child care facilities in the city. This chapter is thus consistent with both the state’s policy of encouraging quality child care facilities and with the city’s general plan. The city has the authority to enact the ordinance codified in this chapter pursuant to Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution and in accordance with the Mitigation Fee Act, Government Code Section 66000 et seq.

     C.     Based on the findings of the city of Palm Desert, the purpose of the child care facilities impact mitigation fee enacted by this chapter is to fund required capital improvements to create new child care facilities or new spaces or improvements to existing child care facilities in the city that will be available to serve the new employees working in new, nonresidential developments in the city. The city council finds that nonresidential development results in businesses whose employees require child care. This child care facilities impact mitigation fee requires new nonresidential development to pay its reasonable share of the increased need for child care facilities generated by such development.

     D.    The city will use the child care facilities impact mitigation fee to construct or cause the construction of new child care facilities or for the expansion or improvements of existing child care facilities in the city. Without limitation due to enumeration, the city shall use the child care facilities impact mitigation fee to construct or cause the construction of new day care centers, new family day care homes and the expansion of existing day care centers and family day care homes. The city’s use of the child care facilities impact mitigation fee shall be consistent with the city’s child care facilities master plan, which may be updated from time to time. Recipients of child care impact fees shall be required to enter into agreements that secure to the city, over time, the benefits derived from those investments, ensuring that the objectives of this chapter are achieved.

     E.     There is a reasonable relationship between the need for the facilities identified in the city’s child care facilities master plan and the types of development projects upon which this fee is to be imposed. New, nonresidential development in the city generates new businesses that need new employees. Many of these new employees require child care facilities. The city anticipates that nineteen thousand five hundred new jobs will be created through build-out of the parcels with nonresidential land use designations in the city’s general plan. As more particularly stated in the city’s child care facilities impact fee nexus study, it is estimated that these new jobs generated by this new nonresidential development will create the need for a substantial number of child care spaces in the city. This need created by this new development may be satisfied by the construction of new day care centers or family day care homes or by the expansion of such facilities. Therefore, the facilities to be funded by the child care facilities impact mitigation fee bear a reasonable relationship to the type of development project on which this fee is to be imposed.

     F.     The use of the child care facilities impact mitigation fee bears a reasonable relationship to the type of development project on which this fee is to be imposed. The city will use the fee to construct or cause the construction of new, expanded or improved child care facilities. As documented in the child care facilities impact fee nexus study, these new, expanded or improved facilities are needed to address the needs of new employees working at the new, nonresidential developments to which the fee applies. Therefore, the fee’s use bears a reasonable relationship to the type of development project on which this fee is to be imposed.

     G.    In any action imposing this child care facilities impact mitigation fee as a condition of approval of a development project, the city shall determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cast of the facility or portions of the facility attributable to the development on which this fee is to be imposed. (Ord. 1101 § 1, 2005)

Pursuant to the fee resolution adopted by the city council, the director of community development shall calculate the fee applicable to any nonresidential development project and determine the facility to be constructed with the fee. The decision of the director of community development is subject to the appeal process set forth in Section 3.45.080.

     B.     All required fees enacted by this chapter must be paid to the city prior to issuance of the building permit for the development. (Ord. 1101 § 1, 2005)

 

3.45.060 Exemptions and credits.
     A.    Development of a child care facility shall be exempt from payment of the fee.

     B.     Nonresidential development that does not add building area or that changes the use of the building such that fewer workers will be employed shall be exempt from payment of the fee.

     C.     A developer may request an offset against any required fee for the construction of a child care facility, land dedication for a new child care facility, or other approved improvements or facilities. A developer must apply to the city council with a specific proposal regarding obtaining such a credit.

     D.    Developers or developments that have constructed a child care facility pursuant to a development agreement or other agreement with the city may receive a credit against the required fee but shall not be entitled to be reimbursed for the cost of the facility that exceeds the fee obligation.

     E.     Recipients of fee offsets shall enter into agreements with the city, ensuring that the mitigation alternatives continue to implement the objectives of this chapter over the useful life of the subject commercial development. (Ord. 1294 § 5, 2015; Ord. 1101 § 1, 2005)

 

3.45.070 Mixed use projects.
     A.    For mixed use projects, the fee shall be charged according to the mix of uses within the development to which the fee applies. For example, if a development contained ten thousand square feet of retail and twenty thousand square feet of office, the total fee would be the sum of the fees applicable to a ten thousand square feet retail project and a twenty thousand square feet commercial project, using the fee amount applicable to each such project type.

     B.     The director of community development shall calculate the fee for a mixed use project pursuant to the provision of subsection A of this section, and such determination shall be subject to the appeal procedures of Section 3.45.080. (Ord. 1101 § 1, 2005)

     B.     An appeal shall only be heard if filed with the city within ninety days after imposition of the development impact fees.

     C.     The city council shall have the authority to:

     1.     Change the amount of the fee when it finds that the amount so established is incorrect or inequitable in the specific case; and/or

     2.     Change the size and/or location of a facility or portion thereof.

     D.    Any such changes shall be in conformity with the spirit and intent of this chapter.

     E.     The appellant shall have the burden of establishing the basis for the appeal and facts to support the appellant’s appeal. The director of community development shall then make a recommendation to city council. Any decision by the city council shall be final. (Ord. 1101 § 1, 2005)

Chapter 3.46 MULTIPLE SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN LOCAL DEVELOPMENT MITIGATION FEE
3.46.010 Short title.
     This chapter shall be known as the “Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Community Conservation Plan Mitigation Fee Ordinance.” (Ord. 1226 § 1, 2011)

 

3.46.020 Findings.
     The city council finds and determines as follows:

     A.    In order to realize the goals and objectives of the Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Community Conservation Plan (“MSHCP”) and to mitigate the impacts caused by new development in the city, lands supporting species covered by the MSHCP must be acquired, monitored and managed in order to achieve habitat conservation in perpetuity.

     B.     The local development mitigation fee (the “fee”) is necessary in order to supplement the financing of the acquisition of lands supporting species covered by the MSHCP and related public services, and to pay for new development’s fair share of the cost of acquisition and perpetual conservation.

     C.     The appropriate source of funding for the costs associated with mitigating the impacts of new development to the natural ecosystems and covered species within the city, as identified in the MSHCP, is a fee paid for by residential, commercial and industrial development. The amount of the fee is determined by the nature and extent of the impacts from the development to the identified natural ecosystems and the relative cost of mitigating such impacts.

     D.    The fee does not reflect the entire cost of the lands which need to be acquired and perpetually conserved in order to implement the MSHCP and mitigate the impact caused by new development. Additional revenues will be required from other sources. The city finds that the benefit to each development project is greater than the amount of the fee to be paid by that project.

     E.     The use of the fee is apportioned relative to the type and extent of impacts caused by the development.

     F.     The costs of funding the proper mitigation for natural ecosystems and covered species identified in the MSHCP which are impacted by new development are apportioned relative to the type and extent of impacts caused by the development.

     G.    The facts and evidence provided to and considered by the city council establish that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for acquiring and conserving in perpetuity the natural ecosystems and covered species identified in the MSHCP, and the impacts to such natural ecosystems and species created by the types of development on which the fee will be imposed; and that there is a reasonable relationship between the fee’s use and the types of development for which the fee is charged. This reasonable relationship is described in more detail in the mitigation fee nexus report.

     H.    The fees collected pursuant to this chapter are reasonable and will not exceed the estimated total cost of the acquisition and perpetual conservation of the lands necessary to protect natural ecosystems and covered species, the plan and schedules for which are set forth in the MSHCP. Conservation of the land shall require monitoring and management beyond the life of the MSHCHP permit.

     I.      The fee shall be used to finance the acquisition and perpetual conservation of lands and certain improvements necessary to implement the goals and objectives of the MSHCP. (Ord. 1226 § 1, 2011)

 

3.46.030 Administrative responsibility.

(Ord. 1226 § 1, 2011)

 

3.46.050 Local development mitigation fee.
     To assist in providing revenue for the conservation of lands necessary to implement the MSHCP, the fee shall be paid for each project, or portion thereof, to be constructed within the city. Five categories of the fee are defined and include: (1) residential units, density less than 8.0 dwelling units per acre; (2) residential units, density between 8.1 and 14.0 dwelling units per acre; (3) residential units, density greater than 14.1 dwelling units per acre; (4) commercial acreage; and (5) industrial acreage. Because there can be mixed traditional commercial, industrial and residential uses within the same project, for fee assessment purposes only, the fee which is applicable to commercial or industrial projects shall be calculated by reference to the project area of each parcel upon which the commercial or industrial portions shall be sited. If the mixed use includes residential units, the fee applicable to the parcels upon which residential units are to be sited shall be calculated by reference to the appropriate residential fee category. If the mixed use occurs on the same parcel, the fee which is applicable to commercial or industrial projects shall be calculated by reference to the project area of the parcel. A fee schedule which contains the fee which is applicable to each of the five fee categories shall be adopted and may, from time to time, be amended by resolution.

     The amount of the fee required to be paid for a commercial or industrial project shall be based on the project area, as calculated by city staff based on the subdivision map, plot plan, and/or other information submitted to or required by the city. (Ord. 1226 § 1, 2011)

 

3.46.060 Imposition of the local development mitigation fee.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of the city’s Municipal Code, no permit shall be issued for any project except upon the condition that the fee applicable to such project has been paid in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1226 § 1, 2011)

 

3.46.070 Payment of local development mitigation fee.
     A.    The fee shall be paid in full at the time of the issuance of a building permit for the project; provided, however, that if the city’s Municipal Code provides for all fees assessed pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act to be collected at a later time, then the fee collected pursuant to this chapter shall be collected at the same time as that mandated by the city’s Municipal Code for the payment of all such other fees.

     B.     In no event shall a final inspection be made or a certificate of occupancy be issued prior to full payment of the fee.

     C.     The fee shall be assessed one time per lot or parcel, except in cases of the construction of additional residential units, subsequent development of portions of a commercial or industrial parcel for which the fee was not originally collected, or changes in land use. The additional fee required to be paid in the case of such exceptions shall not include the amount of any previously paid fee for that parcel. No refunds shall be provided for changes in land use to a lower fee category. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide documentation of any previously paid fee.

     D.    The fee required to be paid under this chapter shall be the fee in effect at the time of payment.

     E.     Notwithstanding anything in the city’s Municipal Code, or any other written documentation to the contrary, the fee shall be paid whether or not the project is subject to conditions of approval by the city.

     F.     If all or part of the project is sold prior to payment of the fee, the project shall continue to be subject to the requirement to pay the fee as provided herein.

     G.    For projects which the city does not require a permit, final inspection or issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the fee shall be paid prior to any use or occupancy.

     H.    For purposes of this chapter, congregate care residential facilities and recreational vehicle parks shall pay the commercial acreage fee. (Ord. 1226 § 1, 2011)

 

3.46.080 Refunds.
     A.    Except as provided in subsection B, there shall be no refund of all or part of any fee paid under this chapter, except in cases of overpayment or miscalculation of the applicable fee.

     B.     Collection of the fee associated with the Fringe-toed Lizard Habitat Conservation Plan (FTL HCP) ceased upon issuance of the MSHCP permit. Projects that paid the FTL HCP fee are required to pay the local development mitigation fee but may obtain a refund of the FTL HCP fee from the CVCC. Refunds shall be granted subject to the rules and regulations established by the Coachella Valley Conservation Commission. (Ord. 1226 § 1, 2011)

 

3.46.090 Collection, accounting and disbursement of local development mitigation fees.
     A.    Subject to the provisions of this section, all fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be collected, administered and remitted for deposit into the account established therefor, to the Commission in compliance with all applicable policies and procedures of the Commission monthly. The fees will be expended solely for the purpose of conservation of the vegetation communities and natural areas within the city and the region which support species covered in the MSHCP in accordance with the plan and schedules set out in the MSHCP and the policies that have or may be adopted pursuant thereto.

     3.     City registration of the project and proposed lots to be exempted, in accordance with CVCC procedures, by September 1, 2011.

     Projects not meeting the standard exemption criteria above, that made verifiable payments, as part of a legal settlement, to specifically fund acquisition of habitat for a species listed as “endangered” under the Federal Endangered Species Act are required to pay the LDMF but are eligible to receive a refund, on a pro rata per acre basis based on the actual acreage being assessed the LDMF. Any such projects and proposed lots to be exempted must be registered in accordance with CVCC procedures by September 1, 2011. (Ord. 1226 § 1, 2011)

 

3.46.120 Fee credits.
     The city may grant to owners or developers of real property, a credit against the fee that would otherwise be charged pursuant to this chapter, for the dedication of land within a MSHCP conservation area; provided, however, that no credit shall be given unless: (A) the dedication is secured by a conservation easement acceptable to a grantee legally authorized to accept and hold such easements pursuant to Civil Code Section 815.3 or pursuant to other legal instrument that ensures the area will be conserved in perpetuity; (B) the land to be dedicated is appropriate for conservation and dedication thereof is consistent with and furthers the goals of the MSHCP; and (C) the dedication and credit complies with all procedures and policies of the Commission. The amount of the credit granted shall be determined by an estimate of the fair market value of the land dedicated. Any credit granted by the city shall be given in stated dollar amounts only.

     An applicant for a proposed project may apply for credit to reduce the amount of the fee required to be paid prior to approval of the project. Any credit granted and the amount of the fee to be paid shall be included as a condition of approval of the project. However, if an applicant has already received approval from the city and has not previously applied for a credit to reduce the amount of the fee required to be paid, an applicant may apply for such credit at any time prior to issuance of a grading permit for the project and any credit granted shall in that case be included as a condition of approval of the grading permit issued for the project. (Ord. 1226 § 1, 2011)

 

3.46.130 Severability.
     This chapter and the various parts, sections, and clauses thereof, are hereby declared to be severable.

     The city council may impose the tax authorized by this chapter at a lower rate and may otherwise repeal or amend this chapter without a vote of the people. However, as required by California Constitution Article XIIC (Proposition 218), voter approval is required for any amendment that would increase the maximum rate or methodology of any tax levied pursuant to this chapter. The people of the city of Palm Desert affirm that the following actions shall not constitute an increase of the maximum rate or methodology of the tax requiring subsequent voter approval:

     A.    The restoration of the rate of the tax to a rate that is no higher than the maximum set by this voter-approved chapter, if the city council has previously acted to reduce the rate of the tax;

     B.     An action that interprets or clarifies the methodology of the tax, or any definition applicable to the tax, so long as interpretation or clarification (even if contrary to some prior interpretation or clarification) is not inconsistent with the language of this chapter;

     C.     The establishment of a class of person or service that is exempt or excepted from the tax or discontinuation of such exemption or exception; and

     D.    Resuming collection of the tax imposed by this chapter, even if the city had, for some period of time, either suspended collection of the tax or otherwise failed to collect the tax, in whole or in part. (Ord. 1339 § 1, 2018)

 

3.50.060 Payment of tax does not authorize illegal activity.
     The payment of the tax required pursuant to this chapter shall not be construed as authorizing the conduct or continuance of any illegal business or of a legal business in an illegal manner. Nothing in this chapter implies or authorizes that any activity connected with the distribution or possession of cannabis is legal unless otherwise authorized and allowed in strict and full conformance to the provisions of this code, including, without limitation, the provisions of Chapter 5.101, 25.16, 25.18 or 25.34. (Ord. 1339 § 1, 2018)

 

3.50.070 Cannabis cultivation/manufacturing tax is not a sales tax.
     The tax provided for under the provisions of this chapter is not a sales, transactions or use tax and shall not be calculated or assessed as such.

3.50.080 Amendments and administration.
     A.    This chapter was submitted to the voters for approval.

     B.     The tax administrator or the tax administrator’s designee may promulgate rules, regulations and procedures to implement and administer this chapter to ensure the efficient and timely collection of the tax imposed by this chapter, including, without limitation, formulation and implementation of penalties and interest to be assessed for failure to pay the tax as provided.

     C.     The tax administrator or the tax administrator’s designee may annually audit the taxes imposed by this chapter to verify that tax revenues have been properly expended in accordance with the law.

     D.    Pursuant to California Constitution Article XIIIB, the appropriation limit for the city is increased to the maximum extent over the maximum period of time allowed under law consistent with the revenues generated by the tax established by this chapter. (Ord. 1339 § 1, 2018)

 

3.50.090 Returns and remittances.
     The tax shall be due and payable as follows:

     A.    The tax established by this chapter shall be collected monthly. Each person owing tax shall prepare and file a tax return to the tax administrator setting out the total amount of tax owed for the preceding calendar month during which the tax was effective. The return shall be filed not later than the close of business on the day that is thirty calendar days following the last day of the preceding calendar month. At the time the tax return is filed, the full amount of the tax owed for the preceding calendar month shall be remitted to the tax administrator.

Whenever any payment, statement, report, request, or other communication received by the tax administrator is received after the time prescribed by this section for the receipt thereof, but is in an envelope bearing a postmark showing that it was mailed on or prior to the date prescribed in this section for the receipt thereof, or whenever the tax administrator is furnished substantial proof that the payment, statement, report, request, or other communication was in fact deposited in the United States mail on or prior to the date prescribed for receipt thereof, the tax administrator may regard such payment, statement, report, request, or other communication as having been timely received by the close of business. If the due date falls on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday, the due date shall be by the close of the next regular business day on which City Hall is open to the public.

     E.     Unless otherwise specifically provided under other provisions of this chapter, the taxes required to be paid pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed delinquent if not paid on or before the due date specified in subsection A or D of this section.

     F.     The tax administrator is not required to send a delinquency or other notice or bill to any person subject to the provisions of this chapter and failure to send such notice or bill shall not affect the validity of any tax or penalty due under the provisions of this chapter.

     G.    The tax administrator may waive the first and second penalties of twenty-five percent each imposed upon any person if:

     1.     The person provides evidence satisfactory to the tax administrator that failure to pay timely was due to circumstances beyond the control of the person and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care and absence of willful neglect, and the person paid the delinquent tax and accrued interest owed the city prior to applying to the tax administrator for a waiver.

     2.     The waiver provisions specified in this subsection shall not apply to interest accrued on the delinquent tax and a waiver shall be granted only once during any twenty-four-month period. (Ord. 1339 § 1, 2018)

     2.     An additional penalty equal to twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax if the tax remains unpaid for a period exceeding thirty calendar days beyond the due date, plus interest on the unpaid tax and interest on the unpaid penalties calculated at the rate established by resolution of the city council; and

     3.     Interest shall be calculated at the rate of one percent per month, or a  fraction thereof, on the total amount due, from the date on which the amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable to the city until the date of payment and shall not exceed twelve percent of the amount of tax due.

     B.     Whenever a check is submitted in payment of a tax and the check is subsequently returned unpaid by the bank upon which the check is drawn, and the check is not redeemed prior to the due date, the taxpayer will be liable for the tax amount plus any penalties and interest due as provided for in this section plus any amount allowed under state law.

     C.     The tax due shall be that amount due and payable from January 1, 2019 or the first date on which the cannabis business first operated in the city, whichever date occurred last, together with applicable penalties and interest calculated in accordance with subsection A of this section.

     B.     No refund of any tax collected pursuant to this chapter shall be made because of the discontinuation, dissolution, or other termination of a cannabis business.

     C.     Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty, or interest has been overpaid, paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, such amount may be refunded to the person who paid the tax provided that a written claim for refund if timely filed with the tax administrator, pursuant to this code. The period for filing a claim for refund shall be one year from the time the tax was paid or erroneously or illegally collected; provided however, that in no event shall the period to file such claim expire prior to the shortest period allowable for filing a tax refund claim under Government Code Section 911.2. Such a claim must clearly establish claimant’s right to the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto, and must clearly set forth the facts and legal theories under which the claimant believes he or she has a right to a refund. Where the amount of any individual refund claim is in excess of the amount set by ordinance or resolution of the city council relating to the settlement of general liability claims against the city by the tax administrator, city council approval shall be required.

     D.    The filing of a written claim pursuant to Government Code Section 935 is a prerequisite to any suit thereon.

     E.     The tax administrator shall have the right to examine and audit all of the books and business records of the claimant in order to determine the eligibility of the claimant to the claimed refund. No claim for refund shall be allowed if the claimant refuses to allow such examination of claimant’s books and business records after request by the tax administrator to do so.

     F.     Any person entitled to a refund of taxes paid pursuant to this chapter may elect in writing to have such refund applied as a credit against a cannabis business’s taxes for the next calendar month.

     G.    If the tax administrator determines that nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of one hundred percent of this amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in this section.

     H.    In the event the tax administrator or the city has expended funds by the use of auditor or any other individual necessary in the review and collection for such refund, all of such costs and expenses of the city shall be deducted from the amount to be refunded.

     I.      In the event that the tax was erroneously paid and the error is attributable to the city, the amount of tax erroneously paid shall be refunded to the claimant. If the error is attributable to the claimant, the city shall retain the amount set forth in this chapter to cover expenses from the amount to be refunded.

     J.      The tax administrator shall initiate a refund of any tax which has been overpaid or erroneously collected whenever the overpayment or erroneous collection is uncovered by the city audit of tax revenues. (Ord. 1339 § 1, 2018)

3.50.120 Enforcement.
     A.    It shall be the duty of the tax administrator to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter.

     B.     For purposes of administration and enforcement of this chapter generally, the tax administrator, with the concurrence of the city attorney, may from time to time promulgate administrative rules and regulations.

     C.     The tax administrator shall have the power to audit and examine all books and records of cannabis businesses as well as persons engaged in the operation of cannabis businesses, including both state and federal income tax returns, California sales tax returns, or other evidence documenting the gross receipts of or the transaction prices charged by a cannabis business or persons engaged in the operation of a cannabis business, for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of tax, if any, required to be paid by the provisions of this chapter, and for the purpose of verifying any statements or any item thereof when filed by any person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. If such cannabis business or person, after written demand by the tax administrator, refuses to make available for audit examination or verification such books, records, or equipment at the tax administrator’s request, the tax administrator may, after full consideration of all information within the tax administrator’s knowledge concerning the cannabis business and its business and activities of the person so refusing, make an assessment in the manner provided in Section 3.50.130.

     D.    The conviction and punishment of any person for failure to pay the required tax shall not excuse or exempt such person from any civil action for the tax debt unpaid at the time of such conviction. No civil action shall prevent a criminal prosecution for any violation of the provisions of this chapter or of any state law requiring the payment of all taxes.

     E.     Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter or any regulation or rule passed in accordance herewith, or knowingly or intentionally misrepresenting to any officer or employee of the city any material fact in procuring the certificate or permit from the city as provided for in this chapter or Chapter 5.101, 25.16, 25.18 or 25.34 of this code shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. (Ord. 1339 § 1, 2018)

 

3.50.130 Debts—Deficiencies—Assessments and appeals.
     A.    The amount of any tax, penalties, and interest imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt to the city and any person operating a cannabis business without having paid any applicable tax, penalties, and interest shall be liable in an action in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction for the amount of the tax, and penalties and interest imposed on such cannabis business.

     B.     If the tax administrator is not satisfied that any statement filed as required under the provisions of this chapter is correct, or that the amount of tax is correctly computed, the tax administrator may compute and determine the amount to be paid and make a deficiency determination upon the basis of the facts contained in the statement or upon the basis of any information in his or her possession or that may come into his or her possession. One or more deficiency determinations of the amount of tax due for a period or periods may be made. When a person discontinues engaging in a cannabis business, a deficiency determination may be made at any time within three years thereafter as to any liability arising from engaging in such business whether or not a deficiency determination is issued prior to the date the tax would otherwise be due. Whenever a deficiency determination is made, notice shall be given to the person concerned in the same manner as notices of assessment are given under subsections C, D, and E of this section.

     C.     Under any of the following circumstances, the tax administrator may make and give notice of an assessment of the amount of tax owed by a person under this chapter.

     1.     If the person has not filed any statement or return required under the provisions of this chapter;

     2.     If the person has not paid any tax due under the provisions of this chapter;

     3.     If the person has not, after demand by the tax administrator, filed a corrected statement or return, or furnished to the tax administrator adequate substantiation of the information contained in a statement or return already filed, or paid any additional amount of tax due under the provisions of this chapter;

     4.     If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any tax due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to penalties and interest otherwise stated in this chapter.

     5.     The notice of assessment shall separately set forth the amount of any tax known by the tax administrator to be due or estimated by the tax administrator, after consideration of all information within the tax administrator’s knowledge concerning the business and activities of the person assessed, to be due under each applicable section of this chapter, and shall include the amount of any penalties or interest accrued on each amount to the date of the notice of assessment.

     D.    The notice of assessment shall be served upon the person either by handing it to him or her personally, or by a deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the person at the address of the location of the cannabis business appearing on the face of the business license issued under Chapter 5.04 of this code, or to such other address as he or she shall register with the tax administrator for the purpose of receiving notices provided under this chapter or Chapter 5.04; or, should the person have no business license issued and should the person have no address registered with the tax administrator for such purpose then to such person’s last known address. For the purposes of this section, a service by mail is complete at the time of deposit in the United States mail.

     E.     Within ten days after the date of service the person may apply in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the assessment. If application for a hearing before the city is not made within the time herein prescribed, the tax assessment by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive. Upon receipt of any such application for hearing, the tax administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing before a hearing officer. At such hearing said applicant may appear and offer evidence why the assessment as made by the tax administrator should not be confirmed and fixed as the tax due. Based upon the submission of such evidence and the review of the city’s files, the hearing officer shall issue a written notice and order upholding, modifying or reversing the determination from which the appeal is taken. The notice shall be given within fourteen calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The notice shall specify that the decision is final and that any petition for judicial review shall be filed within ninety calendar days from the date of the decision in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6. If the hearing officer fails or refuses to act on an appeal within the fourteen-calendar-day period, the appeal shall be deemed to have been denied by the hearing officer on the fifteenth calendar day. (Ord. 1339 § 1, 2018)

 

3.50.140 No injunction/writ of mandate.
     No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in any suit, action, or proceeding in any court against this city or against any officer of the city to prevent or enjoin the collection under this chapter of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected and/or remitted. (Ord. 1339 § 1, 2018)

 

3.50.150 Future amendment to cited statute.
     Unless specifically provided otherwise, any reference to a state or federal statute in this chapter shall mean such statute as it may be amended from time to time; provided, that such reference to a statute herein shall not include any subsequent amendment thereto, or to any subsequent change of interpretation thereto by a state or federal agency or court of law, to the extent that such amendment or change of interpretation would require voter approval under California law, or to the extent that such change would result in a tax decrease. Only to the extent voter statute (or interpretation) shall remain applicable. For any application or situation that would not require voter approval or would not result in a decrease of a tax, provisions of the amended statute (or new interpretation) shall be applicable to the maximum possible extent. To the extent that the city’s authorization to collect or impose any tax imposed under this chapter is expanded or limited as a result of changes in state or federal law, no amendment or modification of this chapter shall be required to conform the tax to those changes, and the tax shall be imposed and collected to the full extent of the authorization up to the full amount of the tax imposed under this chapter.

Title 4 ART
Chapter 4.10 ART IN PUBLIC PLACES

Chapter 4.10 ART IN PUBLIC PLACES
4.10.010 Purpose.
     The city council finds and declares as follows:

     A.    Cultural and artistic resources enhance the quality of life for individuals living in, working in and visiting the city.

     B.     Balanced development of cultural and artistic resources preserves and improves the quality of the urban environment and increases real property values.

     C.     As development and revitalization of the real property within the city continues, the opportunity for creation of cultural and artistic resources is diminished.

     D.    As this development and revitalization continues as a result of market forces, urbanization of the community results.

     E.     As these opportunities are diminished and this urbanization occurs, the need to develop alternative sources for cultural and artistic outlets to improve the environment, image and character of the community is increased.

     F.     Development of cultural and artistic assets should be financed by those whose development and revitalization diminishes the availability of the community’s resources for those opportunities and contributes to community urbanization.

     G.    Establishment of this art in public places program will promote the general welfare through balancing the community’s physical growth and revitalization and its cultural and artistic resources.

     H.    In promotion of the foregoing objectives, the city council through Ordinance No. 473 previously established an art in public places program and fund.

4.10.030 Art in public places fund.

With respect to all other residential development (that is, developments designed to be used as homes for human habitation), the total building permit valuation shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.

     B.     All commercial development (that is, developments other than residential development and public facilities) within the city shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.

     C.     All public facilities (that is, projects designed for use by the general public) constructed by the city and its redevelopment agency or by any other government entity within the city’s jurisdiction shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter, except for street and drainage projects.

This topic has been modified. View the section for details. 5.10.075 Termination and amortization of short-term rentals in R-1 and R-2 zones—Hardship Extensions.
     A.    This section shall apply to short-term rental permits in R-1 and R-2 zones that are to be terminated by December 31, 2019 (“terminating short-term rentals”) under Section 5.10.070. The purpose of this section is to prevent an unconstitutional taking of private property without compensation under the federal or state constitutions by providing for an extension of the amortization period past December 31, 2019 as necessary to avoid a taking (“hardship extension”). Hardship extensions are intended to provide terminating short-term rental owners the additional time necessary within which to recover costs that they reasonably invested primarily for short-term rental use to the extent that such costs could not already have been recovered during the allowed period of short-term rental use of the property and cannot be recovered once the short-term rental use is terminated. The provisions of this section supersede any other provision of this code relating to the continuation or amortization of a non-conforming use and shall at all times be interpreted to prevent an unconstitutional taking of private property under the federal or state constitutions.

     B.     The city council shall adopt by resolution a policy detailing the process for applying for and deciding applications for hardship extensions. Application for hardship extensions shall initially be considered by the department of community development. The city manager is authorized to finally decide such applications and there shall be no appeals to the city council. The city council may also establish fees by resolution for the processing and consideration of hardship extension applications and appeals.

     Upon the conclusion of the amortization period, including any hardship extension, the terminating short-term rental use shall cease. Thereafter, the owner’s property may be used as a long-term residence, a long-term residential rental, or for any other lawfully permitted or conditionally permitted use in the zone.

Failure of the operator to respond to calls or complaints regarding the condition, operation, or conduct of occupants and/or guests of the short-term rental unit within thirty minutes and in an appropriate manner shall render the operator subject to all administrative, legal and equitable remedies available to the city, up to and including short-term rental permit revocation.

     C.     The operator shall post the current short-term rental permit number on, or in, any advertisement appearing in any newspaper, magazine, brochure, television trade paper, Internet website, etc., that promotes the availability or existence of a short-term rental unit in a place or location deemed acceptable by the city manager.

     D.    The operator shall use reasonably prudent business practices to ensure that the occupants and/or guests of the short-term rental unit do not create unreasonable noise in violation of Palm Desert Municipal Code (PDMC) Chapter 9.24, Noise Control or disturbances, engage in disorderly conduct, or violate any applicable law, rule or regulation pertaining to the use and occupancy of the subject short-term rental unit.

Chapter 5.91 ABANDONED SHOPPING CARTS
5.91.010 Findings and purpose.
     The city of Palm Desert finds that abandoned shopping carts in the city create potential hazard to the health and safety of the public, and interfere with pedestrian and vehicular traffic and create a public nuisance. The accumulation of abandoned carts on public and private property tends to create conditions that reduce property values, and promote blight and deterioration that result in a public nuisance. This chapter is intended to ensure that measures are taken by the owners of shopping carts to prevent the removal of the shopping carts from the owner’s premises, to make removal of the cart a violation of this code, and to facilitate the retrieval of abandoned shopping carts in a manner consistent with state law. (Ord. 1187, 2009)

 

5.91.020 Definitions.
     “Abandoned shopping carts” means any cart that is located outside the premises or parking lot of a retail establishment which owns the cart, except a cart that is in the physical possession of a person who has the written consent of the cart’s owner.

     “Cart owner” means every person who, in connection with the conduct of a retail establishment owns, rightfully possesses, or makes any cart available to patrons and/or the public. This shall include the owner’s agent or authorized representative.

     “City” means the city of Palm Desert or its designated representatives.

     “Identified cart” means a shopping cart that has a permanently affixed sign that identifies, in accordance with California Business and Professions Code Section 22435.1, the owner of the cart or the retailer, or both; notifies the public of the procedure to be utilized for authorized removal of the cart from the owner’s premises; notifies the public that the unauthorized removal of the cart from the cart owner’s premises or cart owner’s parking area or the unauthorized possession of the cart, is a violation of state law; and lists a valid telephone number or address for returning the cart to the owner or retailer. If the cart owner operates more than one store, the sign shall identify the location of the store where the cart is used.

     “Parking area” means a parking lot or other property provided by a retail establishment for use by a customer for parking an automobile or other vehicle. In a multistore complex or shopping center, “parking area” includes the entire parking area used by or controlled by the complex or center.

Shopping cart also includes a cart used in a coin-operated laundry or dry-cleaning retail establishment for purposes of transporting clothes and necessary cleaning materials.

5.91.030 Declaration of a public nuisance.
     Any abandoned shopping cart is declared to constitute a public nuisance that could impede emergency services, interfere with pedestrian and vehicular traffic, reduce property values, promote blight and deterioration, comprise an attractive nuisance and create other hazards to the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. (Ord. 1187, 2009)

 

 

5.91.040 Mandatory effective shopping cart nuisance abatement program.
     It is unlawful for any person owning a retail establishment located in the city where shopping carts are available for customer use not to implement and maintain an effective shopping cart nuisance abatement program. Effectiveness is defined by the performance of the retail establishment’s program. The retail establishment may use any reasonable means in any combination to: (1) prevent the removal or theft of their shopping carts from their premises and parking area and subsequent abandonment of their shopping carts within the city limits; and (2) if their prevention program is not one hundred percent effective, to retrieve any and all their abandoned shopping carts from within the city boundaries within forty-eight hours. The effective program must also have the following minimum requirements:

     A.    The retail establishment must register that they own shopping carts for the use of their customers on their premises with the city finance department within sixty days of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter or at the time of business license application or renewal, whichever is first, and must have an effective shopping cart nuisance abatement program within six months of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter or commencing with the issuance of a business license or the renewal of the business license, whichever is first. This registration must include a contact phone number at the retail establishment in Palm Desert for the person or persons, or job title of the person who will be responsible for accepting all shopping carts retrieved by the city and returned to the retail establishment during its normal hours of business.

     B.     The owner shall provide signage on their premises in a conspicuous location notifying shopping cart users that removal of shopping carts from the premises or parking area is prohibited without the written consent of the business owner.

     C.     The owner of a retail establishment shall mark all shopping carts used in its business by its customers as required by California Business and Professions Code Section 22435.1. The owner shall permanently affix a sign to each cart that identifies the owner of the cart or the retailer, or both; notifies the public of the procedure to be utilized for authorized removal of the cart from the cart owner’s premises; notifies the public that the unauthorized removal of the cart from the cart owner’s premises or cart owner’s parking area or the unauthorized possession of the cart is a violation of state law; lists a valid telephone number, or address for returning the cart to the cart owner.

     Each day during which the retail establishment owning more than five shopping carts has not registered with the city and each day all of the carts of a retail establishment are not marked as required by this section shall constitute a separate violation.

     D.    Customer Outreach. A customer outreach process under which the owner shall cause additional notice to be provided to customers in addition to the standard signage and marking of the shopping cart as per subsections B and C that the removal of carts from the premises is prohibited and is a violation of state and local law. This customer outreach notification may include, but is not limited to, flyers distributed at the premises, warnings on shopping bags, direct mail, announcements using intercom systems at the premises, web site. It may also include marketing to customers their own personal cart for use in lieu of the retail establishment’s shopping cart. The exact means and frequency of this outreach is to be determined by the retail establishment.

     E.     Either an effective containment program for physically preventing the shopping carts from being removed from the retail establishment parking area, or an effective program to retrieve abandoned carts within forty-eight hours, or both.

     For purposes of this section, “effective containment system” means a system selected by the retail establishment that results in no more than five shopping carts being removed without the owner’s consent from the business premises or parking area within the twelve-month period commencing with the issuance of a business license or the renewal of the business license.

     An “effective retrieval program” shall mean no more than five abandoned shopping carts are collected by the city or its contractor within the city limits and returned to the retail establishment within the twelve-month period commencing with the issuance of a business license or the renewal of the business license. There is a rebuttable presumption that a cart found abandoned somewhere off the premises of the cart’s owner was removed from the premises without the owner’s consent and that if the city or its contractor removes it and returns it to the retail establishment, the cart was abandoned for more than forty-eight hours.

     If a retail establishment has a valid and operational contract with a contractor recognized by the city to retrieve abandoned shopping carts and return them to the retail establishment on an ongoing and regular basis of at least three times per week, the owner automatically is deemed to have an effective shopping cart nuisance abatement program and exempt from any nuisance abatement and administrative fees per Section 5.91.070. (Ord. 1187, 2009)

 

5.91.050 Removal of shopping carts from retail establishments prohibited.
     It is unlawful for any person other than a cart owner or its authorized representative to remove a cart from the premises of the owner’s retail establishment, unless the cart owner expressly authorizes its removal in writing. (Ord. 1187, 2009)

 

5.91.060 Retrieval of abandoned carts from within the city.
     The city, or its contractor, may retrieve any abandoned shopping cart and return the cart to its owner if it has been abandoned outside the parking area of the retail establishment and not retrieved by the owner or their contractor after forty-eight hours. The owner of the shopping cart must make a store employee available to be present during normal store hours to receive the returned carts and document that they were returned. The city shall recover its cost for this activity through a nuisance abatement and administrative fee. (Ord. 1187, 2009)

 

5.91.070 Nuisance abatement and administrative fees.
     A.    Nuisance Abatement Fee. Retail establishments that have ineffective abatement programs are subject to an annual nuisance abatement fee at the time of renewal of their business license equal to the cumulative cost to the city for retrieval and return of the retail establishment’s abandoned shopping carts over a twelve-month period commencing with the issuance of a business license or the renewal of the business license.

     B.     Administrative Fee. An administrative fee to cover the city’s administrative cost for the activities performed in Section 5.91.060 by the city may also be imposed upon the owners of abandoned carts at the time of business license renewal. Such fee shall not exceed the city’s reasonable estimate of actual cost for such services. (Ord. 1187, 2009)

 

5.91.080 Penalty for violation.
     Violation of any provision of this section is a violation of this article and the city may pursue any available remedy provided under this code for a code violation, including the issuance of an administrative citation under Section 1.12.010 of the Palm Desert code.

     Notwithstanding any other enforcement action allowed under this code, the city council may prescribe the civil fine for any person owning a retail establishment who is given a civil citation for not having established an effective shopping cart nuisance abatement program pursuant to Section 5.91.040. (Ord. 1187, 2009)

     The owner shall be entitled to an administrative hearing upon request, within five days, before the city manager or his representative to determine whether said dog is vicious or dangerous, and, if so, the nature and extent of orders to be made. If, after said requested hearing, it is determined that the dog is vicious or dangerous, the city may, as provided in this section make such other and further orders as are reasonable under the circumstances. If restraint or confinement is impracticable, the animal shall be impounded until the owner or harborer is able to comply with the city manager’s orders.

It is unlawful for any person to act as a tobacco retailer without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco retailer’s license pursuant to this chapter for each location at which that activity is to occur.

     C.     Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer’s license any status or right other than the right to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the city identified on the face of the permit. For example, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to render inapplicable, supercede, or apply in lieu of any other provision of applicable law, including, without limitation, any condition or limitation on smoking in enclosed places of employment made applicable to business establishments by California Labor Code Section 6404.5. (Ord. 1049 § 3, 2003)

 

8.34.030 Application procedure.
     Application for a tobacco retailer’s license shall be submitted in the name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be signed by each proprietor or an authorized agent thereof.

A license that is issued in error or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor may be revoked pursuant to Section 8.34.090 of this chapter. All applications shall be submitted on a form supplied by the department and shall contain the following information:

     A.    The name, address, and telephone number of each proprietor;

     B.     The business name, address, and telephone number of the single fixed location for which a tobacco retailer’s license is sought;

     C.     The name and mailing address authorized by each proprietor to receive all license-related communications and notices (the “authorized address”). If an authorized address is not supplied, each proprietor shall be understood to consent to the provision of notice at the business address specified in subsection (B) of this section;

     D.    Whether or not any proprietor has previously been issued a license pursuant to this chapter that is, or was at any time, suspended or revoked and, if so, the dates of the suspension period or the date of revocation; and

     Upon the receipt of an application for a tobacco retailer’s license and the license fee, the department shall issue a license unless substantial record evidence demonstrates one of the following bases for denial:

     A.    The application is incomplete or inaccurate; or

     B.     The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing by a proprietor for which or whom a suspension is in effect pursuant to Section 8.34.080 of this chapter; or by a proprietor which or who has had a license revoked pursuant to Section 8.34.090 of this chapter; or

     C.     The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing that is prohibited pursuant to Section 8.34.020 of this chapter (e.g., mobile vending), that is unlawful pursuant to this Palm Desert code (e.g., the zoning code), or that is unlawful pursuant to any other local, state or federal law. (Ord. 1049 § 3, 2003)

 

8.34.050 Display of license.
     Each license shall be prominently displayed in a publicly visible location at the licensed premises. (Ord. 1049 § 3, 2003)

 

8.34.060 Fees for license.
     The fee to issue or to renew a tobacco retailer’s license shall be established by resolution of the city council of Palm Desert, California. The fee shall be calculated so as to recover no more than the total cost of license administration and enforcement, including, for example, but not limited to, issuing the license, administering the license program, retailer education, retailer inspection and compliance checks, documentation of violations, and prosecution of violators. Fees are nonrefundable except as may be required by law. (Ord. 1049 § 3, 2003)

 

8.34.070 Licenses nontransferable.
     A tobacco retailer’s license is nontransferable. If the information required in the license application pursuant to Section 8.34.030, subsections (A) through (C), changes a new tobacco retailer’s license is required before the business may continue to act as a tobacco retailer. For example, if a proprietor to whom a license has been issued changes business location, that proprietor must apply for a new license prior to acting as a tobacco retailer at the new location. Or if the business is sold, the new owner must apply for a license for that location before acting as a tobacco retailer. (Ord. 1049 § 3, 2003)

 

8.34.080 License violation.
     A.    Violation of Tobacco-Related Laws. It is a violation of a tobacco retailer’s license for a licensee or his or her agent or employee to violate any local, state, or federal tobacco-related law.

8.34.090 Suspension or revocation of license.
     A.    Suspension or Revocation of License for Violation. In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, a tobacco retailer’s license shall be suspended or revoked if the department finds, after notice to the licensee and opportunity to be heard, that the licensee or his or her agents or employees has or have violated the requirements of this chapter or other conditions of the license imposed pursuant to Section 8.34.080.

     1.     Upon a finding by the department of a first license violation within any sixty-month period, the license shall be suspended for thirty days.

     B.     Suspension of License for Failure to Pay Renewal Fee. A tobacco retailer’s license that is not timely renewed pursuant to Section 8.34.020(B) shall automatically be suspended by operation of law. If not renewed, a license shall be automatically revoked two years after the renewal date.

     C.     Revocation of License Issued in Error. A tobacco retailer’s license shall be revoked if the department finds, after notice and opportunity to be heard, that one or more of the bases for denial of a license under Section 8.34.040 existed at the time application was made or at any time before the license issued. The revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new application for a license.

 

     D.    Appeal of Suspension or Revocation. A decision of the department to revoke or suspend a license is appealable to the city council and must be filed with the city clerk within ten days of mailing of the department’s decision. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the appealed action. A suspension or revocation pursuant to subsection B is not subject to appeal. (Ord. 1049 § 3, 2003)

 

8.34.100 Administrative fine.
     A.    Grounds for Fine. If the department finds, based on substantial evidence, that any unlicensed person, including a person named on a revoked or suspended license, has engaged in tobacco retailing in violation of Section 8.34.020 of this chapter, the department shall fine that person as follows:

     1.     A fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for a first violation in any twelve-month period;

In the event that a judicial action is necessary to compel payment of the fine and accumulated interest, the person or persons subject to the fine shall also be liable for the costs of the suit and attorney’s fees incurred by the city in collecting the fine.

     D.    Notice of Hearing. If a hearing is requested pursuant to subsection B of this section, the department shall provide written notice, within forty-five calendar days of its receipt of the hearing request, to the person or persons subject to a fine of the date, time, and place of the hearing in the manner specified above for a notice of violation.

     E.     Hearing Decision. The hearing officer shall render a written decision and findings within twenty working days of the hearing. Copies of the decision and findings shall be provided to the person or persons subject to a fine in the manner specified above for a notice of violation.

Chapter 8.40 RECREATIONAL VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY

Chapter 8.70 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE
8.70.010 Purpose and intent—Violation of chapter.
     The city council has determined that the quality of life in Palm Desert is tied to the character and condition of real property within the city, and that inadequate property maintenance tends to cause a diminution in the enjoyment, use, aesthetics, and value of surrounding properties. It is the purpose of this chapter to restate, cross-reference, and amend the city’s property maintenance standards, in an effort to promote public awareness of those standards, visual unity and order, as well as enhance the value of land and development within the city, and protect the appearance, integrity and character of the community. Restatements and cross-references of existing code provisions and laws are not intended to supersede or conflict with those laws.

     Inspection of property for compliance with these standards may be accomplished in any constitutionally permissible fashion including inspection from public rights-of-way, inspection with a property owner or occupier’s consent, and inspection through a court-issued warrant. Violations of the property management standards of this chapter are declared a public nuisance, which may be abated by the city in accordance with Chapter 8.20 of this code. In addition to or in lieu of such administrative abatement, the city may pursue any other legal or equitable remedies available to it under this code or state law, including but not limited to the procedures contained in the California Health and Safety Code.

8.70.040 Substandard buildings and housing.
     Buildings and structures on property shall not be left abandoned, partially destroyed, in an “unreasonable state of partial construction,” or in a condition that violates an applicable provision of the California Health and Safety Code or of the California Codes previously adopted by the city, as the same currently exist or may hereafter be amended. See California Health and Safety Code Sections 17920.3 and 17922.2; see also Chapter 15 of this code.

     For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

     “Abandoned” means forsaken and devoid of any apparent owner or other person claiming title, or unoccupied and unmaintained for such an extended period of time and in such a manner as to give an outward appearance that all claims to possession or control have been relinquished.

Chapter 9.25 MULTIPLE RESPONSES TO LOUD OR UNRULY PARTIES, GATHERINGS OR OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS
9.25.010 Declaration of findings and policy.
     It is hereby found and declared that:

     A.    Due to inadequate supervision, some large gatherings of people, such as parties, frequently become loud and unruly to the point that they constitute a threat to the peace, health, safety, or general welfare of the public as a result of conduct such as one or more of the following: excessive noise, excessive traffic, obstruction of public streets or crowds who have spilled over into public streets, public drunkenness, the service of alcohol to minors, fights, disturbances of the peace and litter.

     B.     The city of Palm Desert is required to make multiple responses to such unruly gatherings in order to restore and maintain the peace and protect public safety. Such gatherings are a burden on scarce city resources and can result in police responses to regular and emergency calls being delayed and police protection to the rest of the city being reduced.

     C.     In order to discourage the occurrence of repeated loud and unruly gatherings, the persons responsible for the public nuisance created by these gatherings should be fined. (Ord. 1172 § 1, 2008; Ord. 1171 § 2, 2008)

 

9.25.020 Loud or unruly gathering—Public nuisance.
     It is unlawful and a public nuisance to conduct a gathering of one or more persons on any private property in a manner which constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property in a significant segment of a neighborhood, as a result of conduct constituting a violation of law. Illustrative of such unlawful conduct is excessive noise or traffic, obstruction or public streets by crowds or vehicles, public drunkenness, the service of alcohol to minors, fights, disturbances of the peace, litter. A gathering constituting a public nuisance may be abated by the city by all reasonable means including, but not limited to, an order requiring the gathering to be disbanded and citation and/or arrest of any law violators under any applicable local laws and state statutes. (Ord. 1243 § 4, 2012; Ord. 1172 § 1, 2008; Ord. 1171 § 2, 2008)

 

9.25.030 Notice of unruly gatherings—Posting, mail.
     A.    When the city intervenes at a gathering which constitutes a public nuisance under this chapter, the premises at which such nuisance occurred shall be posted with a notice substantially in the form in subsection C of this section stating that a public nuisance under this chapter was caused by a gathering at the premises, the date and time of the police intervention, and that any subsequent or second police intervention with respect to a nuisance under this chapter at said premises, including a second intervention that same day or night, within sixty days of the first intervention, shall result in the joint and several liability of any guests causing the public nuisance, persons who are residents or in control of the property at which the public nuisance occurred, persons who sponsored the gathering constituting the public nuisance, and owners of the premises as more fully set forth in Sections 9.25.040 through 9.25.060 of this chapter. The residents and persons in control of such property, and the sponsors of the event, shall be responsible for ensuring that such notice is not removed or defaced and shall be liable for a civil penalty of one hundred dollars in addition to any other penalties which may be due under this chapter, if such notice is removed or defaced; provided, however, that the residents of the premises or sponsor of the event, if present, shall be consulted as to the location in which such notice is posted in order to achieve both the security of the notice and its prominent display. The notice shall remain posted for the entire sixty-day period.

     B.     Notice of the police intervention shall also be mailed to any property owner at the address shown on the city’s property tax assessment records and shall advise the property owner that any subsequent gathering resulting in a public nuisance within sixty days on the same premises necessitating city intervention shall result in liability of the property owner for all penalties associated with such intervention as more particularly set forth below.

9.25.040 Persons liable for subsequent response to a gathering constituting a public nuisance.
     If the city is required to intervene as to a gathering constituting a public nuisance on the same premises more than once in any sixty-day period, including a second intervention during the same day or night as the first intervention, the following persons shall be jointly and severally liable for civil penalties as set forth in Section 9.25.050 of this chapter, in addition to liability for any injuries to city personnel or damage to city property.

     A.    The person or persons who own the premises where the gathering constituting a public nuisance took place if any of the following are the case: (1) said owner resides on or adjacent to the premises; (2) said owner was present when the notice described in Section 9.25.030(C) was first posted; or (3) the notice described in Section 9.25.030(C) was mailed to said owner and fourteen days have elapsed since the date of said mailing. For purposes of this subsection, where a gathering takes place within the confines of a single unit in a building owned by a housing cooperative, the owner of the property shall be deemed to be the owner of the single unit and not the members of the housing cooperative in general. Where the gathering took place in the common area of a building owned by a housing cooperative, only the members of the cooperative owning units in the building where the gathering took place shall be deemed the owners of the property for purposes of this subsection. Other members of the housing cooperative may still be liable if they fall within the categories of person made liable by subsection B, C, or D of this section.

     B.     The person or persons residing on or otherwise in control of the property where such gathering took place.

     C.     The person or persons who organized or sponsored such gathering.

     D.    All persons attending such gathering who engaged in any activity resulting in the public nuisance.

     E.     Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose liability on the resident or owners of the premises or sponsor of the gathering, for the conduct of persons who are present without the express or implied consent of the resident or sponsor, as long as the resident and sponsor have taken all steps reasonably necessary to exclude such uninvited participants from the premises. Where an invited guest engages in conduct which the sponsor or resident could not reasonably foresee and the conduct is an isolated instance of a guest at the event violating the law which the sponsor is unable to reasonably control without the intervention of the police, the unlawful conduct of the individual guest shall not be attributable to the sponsor, owner, or resident for the purposes of determining whether the event constitutes a public nuisance under this section.

     F.     There shall be no liability for civil penalties under this chapter for a subsequent intervention during the same day or night as the prior intervention, unless a reasonable time has been provided to abate the public nuisance, taking into account the size of the gathering, the time of day, and other relevant factors.

     G.    There shall be no liability for civil penalties under this chapter for a second response during the same day or night as the first response when a person who would otherwise be liable under subsection A seeks assistance from the police department to abate a public nuisance under this chapter, and the person cooperates fully with the police while taking reasonable action to abate the public nuisance.

     H.    If the city is required to intervene at a gathering constituting a public nuisance on the same premises more than once in any sixty-day period, excluding a second intervention during the same day or night as the first intervention, the sixty-day period shall be extended by another sixty days from the date of the second intervention. (Ord. 1172 § 1, 2008; Ord. 1171 § 2, 2008)

 

9.25.050 Recovery of subsequent response fee.
     A.    After given proper notice pursuant to Section 9.25.030 and a reasonable opportunity to abate a gathering constituting a public nuisance, a subsequent response fee shall be assessed against all persons liable for the city’s intervention. The subsequent response fee shall include:

     1.     The actual cost to the city of law enforcement services incurred as a result of a subsequent response;

     2.     The actual cost of any medical treatment required by a police officer for injuries sustained during a subsequent response;

     3.     The cost of repairing or replacing any city equipment or property damaged or destroyed during a subsequent response.

     B.     Except as provided in subsection A of this section, the subsequent response fee shall not exceed one thousand dollars for any subsequent response.

     C.     The remedies set forth in this chapter shall be in addition to any other penalties imposed by law for particular violations of law committed during the course of an event which is a public nuisance under this chapter; provided, however, that if the only violation of law which constituted the public nuisance under this chapter is excessive noise, the remedies provided under this chapter shall be exclusive of any other remedies provided by law to the city for such excessive noise.

     D.    The city shall bill all persons liable for subsequent response fees by mail by sending a letter in substantially the form in subsection E of this section. Payment of the fees shall be due within thirty days of the date the bill is deposited in the mail. If full payment is not received within the required time for payment, the bill will be delinquent, and all persons liable for the fees shall be charged interest at the maximum legal rate from the date the payment period expires and a further civil penalty in the amount of one hundred dollars.

To: 

 

Dear:      

 

The City of Palm Desert was required to abate the public nuisance caused by a gathering of 10 or more persons at (location of property), which substantially disrupted the quiet enjoyment of property in a significant segment of the adjacent neighborhood. This is the (second/third/fourth, etc.) such public nuisance at this property within the last 60 days, and thus, a fee of ___________ is imposed on you. If you fail to remit this fine to the city of Palm Desert by (30 days from the date of this notification) you will be liable for an additional $100 penalty, plus interest. The payment should be remitted to the address listed below. Your liability is based on the fact that you were:

 

[ ]    An owner of the property to whom was sent prior notice of a public nuisance at the property within the previous 60 days; and/or

 

[ ]    An owner of the property who resided on or adjacent to the property when the public nuisance took place; and/or

 

[ ]    An owner of the property who was present when a notice of a public nuisance was first posted at the property; and/or

 

[ ]    A person who resided on or was otherwise in control of the property when the public nuisance took place there; and/or

 

[ ]    A person who organized or sponsored the event that created the public nuisance at such property; and/or

 

[ ]    A person who attended the event constituting the public nuisance at such property and engaged in the conduct which resulted in the public nuisance.

 

If you believe that you are not liable you may defend this claim in the civil action which the City of Palm Desert will file against you upon your failure to remit the fee. You should be aware, however, that if you fail to prevail in that action you will be liable for the additional penalty of $100 and interest on the total fee.

 

Sincerely yours,

Chapter 9.40 GRAFFITI
9.40.005 Intent and purpose.
     A.    Graffiti on public and private property is a blighting factor which not only depreciates the value of the property which has been the target of such malicious vandalism, but also depreciates the value of the adjacent and surrounding properties, and, in doing so, negatively impacts upon the entire community. The city has in the past undertaken to remove graffiti from public and privately owned property but has been unable to mount a successful program for encouraging property owners to undertake to remove graffiti from walls, building, structures and other surfaces. Section 53069.3 of the Government Code authorizes the city under certain conditions to provide for the removal of graffiti.

     B.     The city council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance, and, unless promptly removed from public and privately owned properties, tends to remain and to attract more graffiti; other properties are then the target of graffiti, with the results that entire neighborhoods, and, indeed, the community is depreciated in value and becomes a less desirable place to live, shop and visit. The city council therefore determines that it is appropriate that the city develop new procedures to implement the provisions of Section 53069.3 of the Government Code and provide for the expedient removal of graffiti from both public and privately owned property under the circumstances set forth hereinafter. The city council further determines that it is appropriate to provide regulations relating to the display for sale of aerosol paint containers and marking pens and to provide penalties relating to possession of graffiti implements for the purpose of engaging in graffiti vandalism.

     C.     Government Code Sections 38772, 38773.2, and 38773.6 authorize cities to adopt ordinances making the expense of abating graffiti caused by certain minors (1) a personal obligation of the minor and of the parents or guardians having custody and control of the minor, and (2) a lien or special assessment against property of the minor and property of the parents or guardians having custody and control of the minor. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 742.14 authorizes cities to adopt ordinances electing to have the probation officer of the county recoup for it, through juvenile court proceedings in accordance with Section 742.16, its costs associated with graffiti damage caused by certain minors. Among other things, this chapter is intended to implement such statutory provisions. (Ord. 789 § 1, 1996; Ord. 719 § 4, 1993)

 

9.40.010 Definitions.
     As used in this chapter:

     “Abatement and related administrative costs” means all city costs associated with damage caused by graffiti, including but not limited to court costs, attorney’s fees, cost of removal of graffiti or other inscribed material, cost of repair and replacement of property defaced by graffiti that cannot be removed cost effectively, and law enforcement time incurred by or charged to the city for identifying and apprehending the person(s) who caused the graffiti.

     “Aerosol paint containers” means any container, regardless of the material from which it is made, which is adapted or made for the purpose of spraying paint or other similar substances capable of defacing property.

     “Felt-tip marker or marking pen” means any indelible marker or similar implement with a tip which, at its broadest width, is greater than one-eighth inch, containing an ink or similar substance.

     “Graffiti” means any inscription, word, figure or design marked, etched, scratched, drawn or painted on any surface without the express permission of the owner (or owner’s representative) of such surface, regardless of the material of which the surface is composed.

     C.     Any person who owns, manages, or operates a place of business wherein aerosol containers of paint and wide-tip markers are sold shall post in a conspicuous place a sign in letters at least three-eighths of an inch high stating: “Any person who maliciously defaces real or personal property with paint or any other liquid is guilty of vandalism which is punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both.” (Ord. 658 § 1, 1991)

 

9.40.025 Storage and display of aerosol paint containers and marking pens.
     Every person who owns, conduct, operates or manages a retail commercial establishment selling aerosol paint containers, or felt-tip marker or marker pens and paint sticks, or similar implements shall store or cause such containers or pens to be stored in an area viewable by, but not accessible to, the public in the regular course of business without an employee assistance, pending legal sale or disposition of such containers or pens. It is the intent of this section to permit, but not to require, the viewing of aerosol paint containers and felt-tip marker or marker pens and paint sticks or similar implements while they are stored or displayed pending retail sale.

9.40.060 Graffiti—Removal.
     A.    Whenever the city manager or his or her designated representative determines that graffiti is so located on public or privately owned property within the city so as to be a public nuisance, the city manager or his or her designated representative is authorized to use city funds to provide, by any means necessary, for the removal of graffiti without reimbursement from the property owner upon whose property the graffiti has been applied. The property owner shall either remove the graffiti within twenty-four hours of verbal or written notification, or provide written consent and release of liability authorizing the city to remove the graffiti at any time it appears. Graffiti on fences and walls immediately adjacent to public rights-of-way will be removed without consent. The city’s removal of graffiti by painting or repair shall not involve the painting or repair of a more extensive area than that area where the graffiti is located or exact matching of the existing paint color.

     B.     In addition to the procedures established by this section, the city is authorized to remove graffiti as a public nuisance and assess for the cost of abatement pursuant to the abatement procedures of Chapter 8.20 of the municipal code whenever the property owner (or owner’s representative) fails to remove the graffiti within forty-eight hours of notification or the city is unable to obtain a written consent and release of liability.

     C.     Whenever the city incurs abatement or related administrative costs to remove graffiti from personal or real property, or to repair or replace property defaced by graffiti that cannot be removed cost effectively, the city may invoice the person(s) who caused the graffiti for such costs, which shall be a personal obligation and debt owed to the city by such person(s). In case of a minor who causes graffiti, an invoice may also be sent to the parents or guardians having custody and control of the minor, who shall be jointly and severally liable with the minor for the city’s abatement and related administrative costs. Invoices shall be due and payable no later than thirty days following their receipt, except to the extent that period is tolled due to a timely request for an administrative hearing. After that, interest on the amount owing shall accrue at the maximum legal rate and the city may proceed to collect the debt through any lawful means, including the procedures established by this chapter and by applicable state law. (Ord. 789 § 4, 1996; Ord. 719 § 2, 1993; Ord. 658 § 1, 1991)

 

9.40.061 Invoice—Contents and service.
     A.    An invoice for abatement and related administrative costs sent pursuant to Section 9.40.060(C) of this code shall include all of the following information:

     1.     A statement notifying the recipient that he/she has been determined by the city to be responsible under Section 38772 of the Government Code and Chapter 9.40 of the city’s municipal code for the city’s expenses of removing certain graffiti in the city and/or repairing or replacing property damaged by such graffiti;

     2.     The location and description of the graffiti for which abatement cost recovery is sought;

     3.     The date by which the invoice must be paid and the fact that interest on the amount owing will accrue at the maximum legal rate if it is not timely paid;

     4.     A statement notifying the recipient of his or her right to request an administrative hearing within ten days of receipt of the invoice regarding liability and/or the amount of costs sought, and the fact that the time period to pay the invoice will be tolled pending the outcome of the hearing;

     5.     A statement notifying the recipient that if he/she does not pay the invoice or request a hearing within the time allowed, then the city’s determinations regarding liability and costs will become final and nonappealable to any other city authority and the city will proceed with lawful collection methods, which in the case of a minor and his or her parents or guardians may include recording a lien or special assessment for the full amount of the invoice plus interest against property of the minor and against property of the parents or guardians.

     B.     The city shall serve the invoice in one of the following ways: (1) by personal service; (2) by both regular first class mail and certified mail with return receipt requested; or, if neither of the previous two methods is available or successful in a given case, (3) by some other method reasonably calculated to provide actual notice to the recipient. If mail service is used, then the return receipt shall constitute evidence of the date the invoice was received. If the certified mail is not accepted, then the invoice will be deemed to have been received by regular mail three days after its mailing.

     C.     Failure to comply with any of the foregoing requirements shall not render the invoice or other cost recovery proceedings defective if they meet minimum constitutional standards for due process. (Ord. 789 § 5, 1996)

 

9.40.062 Hearing—Notice and procedure.
     A.    Any person sent an invoice for abatement or related administrative costs pursuant to Section 9.40.060(C) of this code is entitled to an administrative hearing regarding liability and/or the amount of costs sought to be recovered, if timely requested. A request for a hearing shall be timely if it is received by the city no later than the close of business on the tenth day following receipt of the invoice. A timely request for a hearing tolls the time for payment of the invoice until the recipient has been notified of the hearing officer’s decision.

     B.     If a hearing is timely requested, the city shall send the party requesting the hearing written notice of the time, date and location of the hearing. The notice shall be served in the same manner as the invoice and shall be reasonably calculated so as to give the recipient at least three days’ advance notice of the hearing. Notice of the hearing officer’s final decision after the hearing shall be similarly served.

     C.     The scope of an administrative hearing shall be limited to either or both of the following issues: (1) liability for costs; and (2) the amount of costs sought to be recovered. The party requesting the hearing shall be entitled to submit evidence on either or both issues, which shall be duly considered by the hearing officer provided it is either presented during the hearing or received by the city manager or his or her designee no later than the close of business on the day before the hearing. No formal rules of evidence shall apply. The party requesting the hearing shall be entitled to attend the hearing but such attendance shall not be mandatory.

     D.    The hearing officer shall be the city manager or his or her designee. The hearing officer’s decision shall be final and nonappealable to any other city authority. Failure to timely request a hearing waives any right to the hearing and renders the determinations reflected in the invoice similarly final and nonappealable. (Ord. 789 § 6, 1996)

 

9.40.063 Delinquent invoice—Collection procedure.
     If an invoice is not paid in a timely manner and the city’s determinations regarding the invoice have become final and nonappealable, then the city may proceed to collect the debt through any lawful means including, in the case of a minor and the parents or guardians having custody and control of the minor, imposition of a “graffiti nuisance abatement lien” following the procedures of Government Code Section 38773.2 or, as an alternative to such a lien, a special assessment following the procedures of Government Code Section 38773.6. To the extent the aforementioned state law and this chapter of the municipal code do not specify a particular aspect of the graffiti nuisance abatement lien or special assessment imposition procedure, the procedures outlined in Sections 8.20.145 and 8.20.150 of this code regarding conventional nuisance abatement liens and special assessments may be followed, provided they do not conflict with applicable state law. (Ord. 789 § 7, 1996)

Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 741.14, the city does elect to have the probation officer of Riverside County recoup for it, through juvenile court proceedings in accordance with Section 742.16 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, its costs associated with defacement by minors of its property and the property of others by graffiti or other inscribed material.

     B.     For purposes of this section only, the city council makes the following cost findings, the specific dollar amounts of which shall be set by council resolution:

     1.     The city’s average costs per unit of measure of identifying and apprehending a person subsequently convicted or otherwise found by a court proceeding to have committed an act prohibited by Section 594, 594.3, 594.4, 640.5, 640.6 or 640.7 of the Penal Code are as follows:

     a.     County Sheriff services rendered to the city under contract, based on the estimated value of hours spent by Sheriff’s personnel and miles driven by patrol vehicles (including fractions thereof),

     b.     Cost per hour of city staff time,

     c.     Cost per mile of city vehicle usage;

     2.     The city’s average costs per unit of measure of removing graffiti or other inscribed material, or of repairing or replacing property defaced with graffiti or other inscribed material that cannot be removed cost effectively, may include any of the following:

     a.     Graffiti removal services rendered to the city under contract with Sunline Transit Agency, based on the estimated value of hours spent by Sunline personnel and miles driven by Sunline vehicles (including fractions thereof),

     b.     Cost per hour (including fractions thereof) of city staff time,

     c.     Cost per mile (including fractions thereof) of city vehicle usage,

     e.     Per square inch cost (including fractions thereof) of paint and material. (Ord. 789 § 8, 1996)

 

9.40.070 Graffiti—Reward.
     A.    A reward in an amount established by resolution of the city council is authorized, offered and may be paid by the city to any person who provides information leading to the determination of the identify of, and the apprehension of, any person who wilfully or maliciously paints, mars or defaces any public or private structure located on private or public property within the city.

     B.     The exact amount of the reward to be paid by the city shall be determined by the city council after receipt of a report from the city manager indicating that information was received leading to the determination of the identity of, and the apprehension of, a person who wilfully or maliciously painted, marred or defaced a structure located on public or private property located within the city, and indicating the final disposition of such matter. No law enforcement officer, municipal officer, official or employee of the city shall be eligible for such reward. (Ord. 658 § 1, 1991)

 

9.40.080 Violation—Penalty.
     It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter.

9.50.040 Rent review board.
     A.    There is established within the city a mobile home park rent review board consisting of three regular members and two alternate members appointed by the city council and serving at the pleasure of the city council. Alternates shall serve only to the extent necessary to form a quorum of two members. The secretary of the board shall determine whether the attendance of one or more alternates at a given meeting is necessary to ensure a quorum and notify them accordingly. Regular and alternate board members shall serve a term of four years, at the end of which he/she may be considered for reappointment. All regular and alternate board members shall be residents of the city during their terms.

     B.     Any member who is absent from three regular meetings of the board during any calendar year shall be deemed to have vacated his or her office.

     C.     Except as expressly provided in this chapter, the board shall establish the time and place of its meetings. All meetings of the board shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Ralph M. Brown Act.

     D.    Disclosure. All candidates for appointment to the board shall disclose in a verified statement all present holdings and interests in real property, including interests in corporations, trusts or other entities owning real property within this jurisdiction as defined by California Government Code Section 82035. Such disclosure statement shall be made available to the city council prior to appointment of members of the board, and shall be filed with the city clerk not less than ten days after appointment. Disclosure of holdings required herein shall be in addition to any other disclosure required by state or local law for holders of public office.

     E.     The board shall make and adopt its own rules and regulations for conducting its business consistent with this chapter and laws of the state, subject to the approval of the city council. Such rules and regulations shall be reduced to writing and shall be on file with the city clerk at all times. The board shall appoint such officers as may be necessary.

     F.     The board shall keep a record of its proceedings, which shall be open for inspection by any member of the public.

     G.    Each member of the board shall be entitled to such compensation as may be set by the city council by ordinance, to be paid entirely from filing fees paid to the city.

     H.    The city manager shall designate an employee who shall serve as the secretary of the board. The city clerk shall be responsible for the maintenance of all its permanent records.

     I.      Two members of the board shall constitute a quorum. Two affirmative votes are required for a decision including all motions, orders and rulings of the board. (Ord. 1305A § 1, 2016; Ord. 800 § 1, 1996; Ord. 560 § 1, 1988; Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.050 Power of the rent review board.
     Within the limitations provided by law, the rent review board shall have the following powers:

     A.    To meet at such times as may regularly be scheduled by the board, or from time to time at the call of the chairman, to herein determine the petitions filed hereunder at the request of the city manager, or otherwise to conduct the business of the board. All meetings shall be conducted at City Hall;

     B.     To appoint and designate hearing officers for the conduct of evidentiary hearings to be conducted hereunder;

     C.     To receive, investigate, hear and determine petitions of landlords for hardship adjustment of rent pursuant to Section 9.50.070;

     D.    To make or conduct such independent hearings or investigations as may be appropriate to obtain such information as is necessary to carry out their duties;

     E.     To authorize an increase in the maximum amount of rent otherwise permitted to be charged by a mobile home park owner pursuant to this chapter. Such authorizations shall be given where the board finds that the application of the chapter, apart from such authorized increase, results or would result in undue hardship to the mobile home park owner’s property. In determining whether a hardship rent increase should be authorized, the board may consider, among other relevant factors, increased cost to the mobile home park owner attributable to increases or decreases in master land and/or facilities lease rent, utility rates, property taxes, insurance, advertising, government assessment and fees, incidental service, normal repair and maintenance, capital improvements, upgrading and addition of amenities or services, and net operating income, as well as just and reasonable return on the mobile home park owner’s property. In examining repair and maintenance costs submitted in a given case, the board shall consider whether those costs could have been minimized or avoided by the park owner through prudent and ongoing maintenance activities; to the extent such costs were exacerbated through unnecessarily deferred, negligent, or otherwise improper repair and maintenance, they shall be disregarded;

     F.     To adopt, promulgate, amend or rescind administrative rules to effectuate the purposes and policies of this chapter, subject to the approval of the city council;

     G.    To maintain and keep at the City Hall rent review hearing files and dockets listing the time, date and place of hearings, the parties involved, the address involved and the final disposition of the hearing;

     H.    To recommend to the city council the adoption of a fee schedule setting such fees and charges as appear necessary or desirable to defray in whole or in part the costs of administration of the board and conduct of its assigned duties;

     I.      To recommend to the city council the imposition of a registration program for implementation of this section, including any registration fees in connection therewith. (Ord. 800 § 2, 1996; Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.060 Maximum rent.
     A.    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter (e.g., a fixed-term rental agreement or a hardship rent adjustment), the maximum rent that a mobile home park owner may request, demand or receive for a mobile home space shall not exceed the monthly rent that was charged for that space on base date (as defined below) adjusted up or down for the change in the cost of living since the base date. In other words, the maximum rent chargeable will increase or decrease over time based on fluctuations (up or down) in the cost of living. As the cost of living goes up relative to the base date, the maximum chargeable rent will also go up; as the cost of living goes down, the maximum chargeable rent will also go down. If the cost of living remains constant, then the maximum chargeable rent also remains constant. In implementing this section, a mobile home park owner shall not increase — nor be obligated to decrease — the rent charged for any space more than once during any twelve-month period, unless an additional increase or decrease is expressly authorized or ordered by the rent review board.

     B.     Notwithstanding the foregoing, no rent increase in a given twelve-month period shall cause the previous rent charged for the space to increase more than six percent unless expressly permitted by the rent review board. If an increase of more than six percent would occur, then the excess increase may be carried forward for a period of up to eight years, until utilized to allow an automatic, annual increase up to six percent unless expressly permitted by the rent review board. If an increase of more than six percent would occur, then excess increase may be carried forward for a period of up to eight years, until utilized to allow an automatic, annual increase up to six percent in any future years in which the permitted increase in the rent would be less than six percent.

     C.     The “base date” shall be April 28, 1983, for any space that was rented on that date and not governed by a fixed-term rental agreement permitted by this chapter. For all other spaces, the base date shall be the first date after April 28, 1983, that the space was rented and not governed by a fixed-term rental agreement permitted by this chapter.

     D.    Changes in the cost of living shall always measure from the base date. For purposes of this section, the change in the cost of living shall be measured by three-quarters (seventy-five percent) of the net change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the base date until any subsequent date in the present. The CPI used for the subsequent date shall be the most recent CPI published before that date.

     E.     Raising rent during a twelve-month period in accordance with this section shall not prevent a park owner from subsequently filing a hardship rent petition during that same period. Nor shall the filing of a hardship rent petition preclude the subsequent imposition of an otherwise allowable rent increase while the petition is pending, provided any such increase is brought to the attention of the city official or board considering the petition. At all times during the hardship petition process, the most recent CPI date shall be used.

     F.     Nonimposition of a rent increase permitted by this section during a twelve-month period shall not affect the maximum rent that a park owner may charge in a later twelve-month period. But a park owner may never retroactively collect rent from tenants that could have been charged but was not. That is, rent increases allowed by this section shall only apply prospectively. (Ord. 800 § 3, 1996; Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.070 Initiation of review and hearing process.
     A.    A mobile home park owner, or any representative of the mobile home park owner, operator or manager of a mobile home park space affected by this chapter, upon payment of such filing fee as shall be duly established, may petition the board for a hardship increase of the maximum rent permitted to be charged pursuant to this chapter. If the board shall designate a form for the filing of such petition, such petition shall be filed upon such form. If no such form shall be designated, such petition shall be in writing, verified by the applicant, and shall contain the name, address and telephone number of the applicant; the name and address of the resident of each mobile home space which would be affected if the petition were granted; a statement of the facts giving rise to the petition for hardship increase, in sufficient detail that if established, such facts would demonstrate the existence of a hardship upon the mobile home park owner warranting such hardship increase; a statement that each resident of a space to be affected by the hardship increase, if granted, has been served a notice of the filing of the petition; such notice shall inform each such resident of the location where the petition may be obtained or reviewed.

     B.     Any resident of a mobile home park, or mobile home park owner, affected by this chapter, upon payment of such filing fee as shall be duly established, may petition the board for an interpretation of this chapter, for a determination of whether a particular course of action, either proposed or actual, is legal, valid and within the terms of this chapter. If the board shall establish forms for such petitions, the petition shall be prepared and submitted upon such form. In the absence thereof, the petition shall contain the name, address and telephone number of the person requesting the interpretation or opinion; the name, address and telephone number of the mobile home park owner, manager or other person authorized to represent the mobile home park owner; the names, addresses and telephone numbers of any other residents of mobile home space of individuals requesting such determination; and a brief statement of the facts giving rise to the request for interpretation or determination.

     The procedural rules with respect to petitions for interpretation shall be those applicable to petitions for hardship rent increases, except that, should the city manager determine to do so, petitions for interpretation which raise issues of a legal nature may be referred to the city attorney for final response, or; in the alternative, for preparation of an opinion and recommendation to the rent review board. Under the first alternative, the city attorney’s opinion shall be final. Under the second alternative, the city attorney’s opinion and recommendation shall become final within fifteen days after the filing of the same with the city clerk, and without further action of the rent review board unless a petition to review the city attorney’s opinion and recommendation is filed by the requesting party with the city clerk.

     C.     In the event that a petition is filed, the petitioner shall serve a notice of the filing of same. If said petition is by management, service shall be on each tenant within the mobile home park on a form provided by the city; if said petition is by a tenant or tenants, service of a notice of the filing of the same shall be on management.

     D.    Within twenty days after the filing of the proof of service of the notice under the preceding subsections, the opposing party may file opposition.

     E.     The hearing officer shall establish a date for hearing, giving notice to all parties thereof, and shall promptly consider and decide all petitions filed pursuant to this chapter. The matters shall be considered and decided in the order filed. The party filing any petition shall deposit with the city the estimated cost, as estimated by the city manager, of all costs to the city, including without limitation the cost of the meeting of the rent review board, the full cost of conducting the hearings as herein provided, the cost of the hearing officer, and the cost of preparation of any record. In the event the funds so deposited exceed the city’s costs, any excess shall be refunded to the parties so depositing the same, and any deficiency must be agreed to be paid by such party. Additional deposits may be required to cover costs when it is determined that the initial deposit is not sufficient to satisfy the same. In the event such deposits, when required, are not made in a timely manner, the petition shall be deemed withdrawn and the proceeding terminated. The hearing officer shall consider all relevant facts presented at the hearing, and may require additional information to be presented by the manager or others to determine what adjustments, if any, should be made.

 

     F.     For any contested hearing, if there is more than one party on a side, the hearing officer may require the parties on one side to designate a representative to receive service of notice and papers and documents with respect to the same; and after such designation, the service on the representative so designated shall be deemed to be giving service to all such parties on that side.

     G.    In the event of any contested hearing, each tenant in the affected mobile home park, (or the tenants’ representative if one has been designated), shall be mailed a notice of the time and place of the commencement of the hearing and the possible effect upon his or her rent. Said mobile home park tenants shall be given a chance and an opportunity to be heard at the contested hearing. No further notice shall be required to be given under this chapter for any continuances of the hearing.

     H.    All meeting and hearings shall be open to the public and notice thereof given as required by law. Meetings shall be held as necessary to hear and decide petitioners.

     I.      The city manager shall notify the petitioning party upon receipt of opposition to the petition, and as soon as possible thereafter shall notify both parties of the time, date and place of hearing.

     J.      Upon receipt of a valid petition pursuant to this chapter, the rent review board, unless it conducts the hearing itself under the provisions of this section, shall refer the petition to the opposition and to a hearing officer who shall conduct an evidentiary hearing upon the petition. At the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer shall take all evidence, and may require any party to the proceedings to provide him or her with pertinent books, records, papers, etc. In furtherance of this power, the hearing officer may request the city council to issue a subpoena for the same if they are not voluntarily produced, or he or she may take a refusal to produce the same as evidence that such evidence, if produced, would be adverse to the party refusing to produce the same.

     K.    The management may substitute for any books, records and papers a certified audit by an independent certified public accountant, using generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, or a verified statement under oath by an independent certified public accountant of what the information sought from such books, records and papers consists of. Notwithstanding this subsection, the hearing officer may require production of the books, records and papers.

     L.     The hearing officer shall rule upon the admissibility of all evidence at the evidentiary hearing, and shall have the power and authority to conduct the evidentiary hearing in all respects.

     M.    The hearing officer shall keep detailed notes of the evidence produced and provide for recording of all of the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing.

     N.    The evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing shall constitute the exclusive record for the decision of the issues involved.

     O.    At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a summary of all testimony and evidence admitted at the evidentiary hearing and a statement of all materials officially noticed, and prepare proposed findings of fact and a recommended decision to the rent review board, and shall promptly submit the same to the rent review board, along with copies of all documentary evidence received. Copies of the hearing officer’s summary, matters officially noticed, and proposed findings and recommendation for decision shall be mailed to all parties participating in the hearing. The hearing officer’s proposed findings and recommended decision shall become the final findings and decision of the rent review board within fifteen days after the filing of the same with the clerk of the rent review board (i.e., the city clerk) without further action of the board, unless any party participating in the hearing shall file a petition to review the hearing officer’s proposed findings and determination with the clerk of the rent review board.

     P.     Upon receipt of the hearing officer’s summary, proposed findings, official noticed material and recommendations, the documentary evidence admitted in the proceedings, and a petition to review filed pursuant to subsection O of this section, the rent review board shall hear arguments by the parties based upon the material submitted to it by its hearing officer. Any party at a proceeding may also have prepared, at his or her expense, a transcript of the hearing to be presented to the rent review board. No further evidence shall be permitted nor allowed at the hearing before the rent review board, but it shall be based solely upon the materials presented to the hearing officer at the evidentiary hearing.

     Q.    1. At the conclusion of the hearing on the proposed findings and recommended decision of its hearing officer before the rent review board pursuant to subsection P of this section, the board shall, within thirty days after the date of the hearing:

     a.     Accept and confirm the recommendations of the hearing officer and adopt his or her findings and recommendations; or

     b.     Amend the findings and recommendations of the hearing officer; or

     c.     Send the matter back to the hearing officer for further hearings on the issue pursuant to any instructions provided by the rent review board.

 

     2.     Upon issuing the findings of fact, pursuant to subdivisions (a) or (b) of this subsection, the rent review board shall render its final decision. The final decision shall be final and conclusive upon all parties. The final decision by the board may include a provision equalizing the rents among all of the tenants of the mobile home park, based upon the location, size and improvements supplied by management of each mobile home site, notwithstanding any previous disparity between rents charged on equivalent mobile home sites. Any tenant whose rents will be so equalized upwards shall be given special notice of the same and chance to be heard.

     R.     Any order of the rent review board shall, unless otherwise specified in its final decision, be effective as of the date thirty days after the filing of the petition for adjustment.

     S.     Any party to a hearing may be assisted by attorneys of the party’s choice.

     T.     No member of the rent review board may participate in the hearing or decision concerning a mobile home park in which he or she resides or has a financial or management interest.

     U.    The rent review board shall keep minutes of its meetings and make an official record of a hearing.

     V.    Decisions of a rent review board shall be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

     W.   The evidentiary hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence may be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions.

     X.    The rent review board may in its final decision direct that the prevailing parties’ cost in these proceedings, including any funds paid to the city pursuant to the provisions of this section, shall be reimbursed by the losing party. Such an order for costs may be enforced by a court of law of appropriate jurisdiction. In the event that the rent review board determines that any petition or opposition is frivolous, it may award reasonable attorney’s fees to the other party or parties.

     Y.    The rent review board or its hearing officer may spread any retroactive rent adjustment under subsection R of this section over several months of future rent. (Ord. 773 § 1, 1995; Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.075 Forced exemption from chapter prohibited.
     A.    It shall be unlawful for any mobile home park owner or manager to require anyone, as a condition of tenancy, to accept a rental agreement that upon execution would be exempt from any provision of this chapter, including, but not limited to, a rental agreement in excess of twelve months’ duration.

     B.     Nothing in this section shall prevent anyone from knowingly and voluntarily accepting a rental agreement that upon execution would be exempt from this chapter, including, but not limited to, a rental agreement in excess of twelve months’ duration. However, any such rental agreement shall bear the following notice in all capital letters and no less than 10-point bold type and shall be initialed by the tenant or prospective tenant:

 

     IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THIS RENTAL AGREEMENT. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THIS RENTAL AGREEMENT, IF SIGNED, CREATES A TENANCY THAT WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE PALM DESERT MOBILE HOME PARK RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE WHICH, ALONG WITH THE STATE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LAW (CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SEC. 798 et seq.), GIVES YOU CERTAIN LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY WISH TO CONSULT A LAWYER BEFORE SIGNING. UNDER STATE AND/OR LOCAL LAW, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE OFFERED A RENTAL AGREEMENT THAT IS NOT EXEMPT FROM THE PALM DESERT MOBILE HOME PARK RENT REVIEW LAW. BY PLACEMENT OF YOUR INITIALS BELOW, YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU RECEIVED THIS NOTICE AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

     _____________________________

     Initials — Tenant/Prospective Tenant

 

     The foregoing notice shall be provided in addition to, and not instead of, any other notices required by state law.

     C.     Unless otherwise dictated by state law, anyone who is required to sign a rental agreement that does not comply with this section on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section may rescind the agreement without penalty and instead insist upon a rental agreement that complies with this section. (Ord. 731 § 1, 1993; Ord. 730 § 1, 1993; Ord. 728 § 1, 1993)

 

9.50.080 Agreements.
     Nothing in this chapter shall operate to restrict the right of tenants and management to enter into agreements providing for a fixed term and/or a fixed rent for mobile home tenancies. Such an agreement may be entered into by an individual tenant and management. Such agreement shall apply to all the spaces in a mobile home park provided that four-fifths of the occupied spaces consent to such agreement. The parties to the agreement shall provide the city with satisfactory proof of consent.

     If the tenants are represented by an association, then if otherwise permitted by law, a majority of the association’s board of directors, or similar governing body, may enter into such agreement with the consent of four-fifths of the occupied spaces. (Ord. 560 § 2, 1988; Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.085 Vacancy increase.
     When a mobile home space becomes vacant or the ownership of a mobile home is changed or transferred, the park owner may not raise the monthly rent, and such rent shall be at the rate previously approved and set by the board for the space occupied. A mobile home owner who has entered into an agreement which violates the terms of this section has the right to rescind the rental provisions of such agreement to bring the rent into compliance. Such right of rescission shall exist for twelve months from the date of the agreement, and is thereafter waived. (Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.090 Enforceability.
     In the event of a violation by the management of a mobile home park of any maximum rents, an effective rent schedule, or a final decision and order of the rent review board, relief for such a violation shall be enforceable by the individual tenants of that park in a court of the appropriate jurisdiction in which injunctive relief may be granted, and damages shall be allowed for any rent paid in excess of the effective rent schedule or any final determination of the rent review board. In any such court proceeding, the prevailing party shall be awarded his or her reasonable attorney’s fees, and the court, where applicable, shall be empowered to order treble damages for any rents charged in excess of any effective rent schedule or maximum rent, or in violation of the final decision of the board (i.e., three times any excessive rent or over charge). (Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.100 Limitation of action to attack a final decision—Order of the rent review board.
     A.    Any action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, annul or void a final decision and order of the rent review board, or the reasonableness, legality or validity of any provision or condition attached thereto, shall not be maintained by any person unless such action or proceeding is commenced, and service of the summons is effected, within ninety days of the filing with the city clerk of the final determination and order, and notice of the same has been given to the city clerk.

     B.     Any request to the rent review board for reconsideration of any decision made by the board must be made:

     1.     Within thirty days of the rendition of the decision; and

     2.     Only upon one or more of the following grounds:

     a.     There is newly discovered evidence which the requesting party was reasonably unable to present at the hearing, or

     b.     There was fraud or other impropriety material to the outcome of the board’s decision committed by either party, or

     c.     There was fraud or other impropriety material to the outcome of the board’s decision committed by a member of the board or the hearing officer.

     Said thirty-day limit may be waived upon showing proper circumstances. (Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.110 Negative declaration.
     A negative declaration of environmental impact is hereby approved. (Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.120 Discrimination and retaliation prohibited.
     It is unlawful for a mobile home park owner, or any agent or representative of the owner, to discriminate or retaliate against any person because of their exercise of any rights provided by this chapter. Such discrimination or retaliation shall be subject to suit for actual and punitive damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. Such discrimination or retaliation shall also be an available defense in an unlawful detainer action. In any action in which such discrimination or retaliation is an issue, the burden shall be on the mobile home park owner to prove that the dominant motive for the act alleged to be discriminatory or retaliatory was in fact other than discriminatory or retaliatory. (Ord. 728 § 2, 1993; Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.130 Termination of service.
     No mobile home park owner shall reduce or eliminate any service to any mobile home space so long as this chapter is in effect, unless and until a proportionate share of the cost savings resulting from such reduction or elimination is passed on to the resident in the form of a decrease in space rent. If a mobile home park owner who provides services to a mobile home space in the nature of utility services, shall reduce or eliminate such service by separate metering or other lawful means of transferring from the mobile home park owner to the resident the obligation for payment for such services, the cost savings, if any, resulting from such reductions or elimination to be passed on to the resident in the form of a decrease of rent, shall be deemed to be the cost of such transferred utility service for the month of April, 1983. If for any reason the utility bill for such service for the month of April, 1983, is not representative of the normal or usual cost of such utility service at the time, or if either mobile home park owner or resident shall protest the use of the April, 1983 billing as the measure of such cost savings, then the computation of such cost savings shall be based upon the average monthly charge for such service for the period of March, 1982, through April, 1983, inclusive, or such other period as the parties shall mutually agree is representative of such cost savings.

     For the purposes of this section, in determining cost savings to be passed on to the resident in the form of decreased rent, the cost of installation of separate utility meters, or similar or analogous costs to the mobile home park owner to shift the obligation for payment of utility costs to the resident, shall not be considered. Nothing stated herein shall be construed to prohibit or prevent the consideration or inclusion of such costs, together with other operational costs of a mobile home park owner, in any proceedings before a duly appointed board, commission or other appointed body authorized to hear and determine requests for hardship adjustments. (Ord. 456 § 2, 1986)

 

9.50.140 Actions brought against city.
     If any action at law or in equity is brought to enforce or interpret any provision of this chapter, the city attorney may defend, in the name of the city, in any court of competent jurisdiction, any such action. In case of recovery by the city, the city shall be entitled to court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees in defending such action. Said fees may be set by the court in the same action or in a separate action brought for that purpose. (Ord. 474 § 1, 1986)

     All RIRs required by this chapter, Civil Code Section 798.56 or Government Code Section 65863.7 shall contain the following information, unless the director determines that any of the following is unduly burdensome to produce when weighed against its informative value:

     A.    A detailed description of the proposed change of use or change without new use;

     C.     A legal description of the park;

     D.    The number of spaces in the park, length of occupancy by the current tenant of each space and current rental rate for each space;

     F.     Appraisals Addressing Relevant Issues Identified by the Director. A qualified appraiser shall be selected by the city and the cost of the appraisals shall be borne by the applicant. The appraisals shall identify those mobile homes which cannot be moved due to type, age or other considerations. Appraisal information shall be provided on the effect upon the mobile home owner’s investment in the mobile home, such as the change in value of affected mobile homes that would result from the proposed change in use;

     G.    The results of questionnaires to the household of all eligible residents, and to all mobile home owners that do not reside in the park, regarding the following: whether the resident owns or rents the mobile home; whether this is the only residence; the ages of other members of the resident’s household; the purchase date and price paid for the mobile home; the costs incurred by the mobile home owner in improving the mobile home; the amount and relevant terms of any remaining mortgage and the source and range of income of resident.

     J.      Estimates from at least two moving companies as to the minimum and per mile cost of moving each mobile home, including tear-down and set-up of mobile homes and moving of improvements such as porches, carports, patios and other moveable amenities installed by the residents.

     K.    Proposed measures to mitigate the adverse impacts of the conversion upon those affected. (Ord. 886 § 1, 1998)

 

9.52.040 Filing of relocation impact report.
     An RIR shall not be considered filed, within the meaning of Government Code Section 65863.7, until the applicant has caused to be submitted to the director both an RIR which the applicant believes meets the requirements of this chapter, and a written statement that such RIR is being filed pursuant to Government Code Section 65863.7. (Ord. 886 § 1, 1998)

 

9.52.050 Notice to new occupants.
     Once an RIR has been filed with the director, the applicant shall thereafter, in addition to the notice requirements of Civil Code Section 798.56(g), give notice to all known prospective mobile home purchasers and prospective mobile home residents within the park, and in all cases prior to execution of any new rental agreement, that the application has been filed. (Ord. 886 § 1, 1998)

 

9.52.060 Request for exemption from relocation mitigation.
     A.    An applicant may file a request for total or partial exemption from the obligation to provide relocation assistance, based upon the following grounds:

     1.     That imposition of any, or of a particular, relocation obligation would eliminate substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the property for alternate uses. The request shall include, at a minimum, an estimate of the value of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser as to its value if the park were permitted to be developed for the use proposed in the application, its value if developed for alternative uses consistent with applicable zoning, and an estimate of the value of such park if use of the property as a mobile home park is continued;

     2.     That the park is exempt from the requirements of relocation assistance under state law governing changes of use of mobile home parks. The request shall specify the provisions of state law pursuant to which the exemption is claimed and documentation demonstrating entitlement to such exemption;

     3.     That relocation assistance would exceed the limitations imposed by Government Code Section 65863.7(e). The request shall specify the particular relocation obligations which would cause this result.

     B.     If a request for exemption is filed, notice thereof, including the grounds for the request, shall be given to mobile home owners, legal owners, and eligible residents in the same manner as provided in this chapter for notice of public hearing. (Ord. 886 § 1, 1998)

 

9.52.070 Public hearing.
     A.    Upon the filing of an RIR, the director shall examine the same and advise the applicant in writing within thirty days after receipt thereof whether it is complete. When an application and RIR have been accepted as complete, the director shall set a time, date and place for a hearing before the planning commission not later than sixty days after the date of acceptance. For purposes of this section, the director may, upon the applicant’s request, deem an RIR complete and proceed to set the time and date of hearing, even though all of the appraisals have not yet been completed, or the applicant has not yet received a response to all questionnaires, provided that all appraisals shall thereafter be completed and submitted at least thirty days prior to the hearing, along with any additional questionnaire responses the applicant has received.

     B.

     The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, where the vehicle or vehicles can be viewed from or parked on the public street or highway, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute a nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare of the public.

     If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land but does not appear, or if an interested party makes a written presentation to the city council but does not appear, he shall be notified in writing of the decision.

     “Golf cart lanes” is synonymous with “golf cart routes” and means all publicly owned facilities that provide for golf cart travel including roadways designated by signs or permanent markings which are shared with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other motorists in the plan area. There shall be three categories of golf cart lanes:

     1.     Class I golf cart lanes provide a right-of-way completely separated from any highway, with cross traffic by other motorists minimized, and designated for the exclusive use of golf carts, or, where feasibly safe and when no parallel improvements for pedestrians and bicyclists are available, designated for the shared use of golf carts, bicyclists and pedestrians.

     2.     Class II golf cart lanes provide a restricted right-of-way on a highway designated by striping and signage for the exclusive or semi-exclusive use of golf carts, with through travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians prohibited, but with vehicle parking and cross traffic by pedestrians and other motorists permitted.

     3.     Class III golf cart lanes are lanes on local streets with speed limits of forty-five miles per hour or less and are shared with pedestrians, bicyclists and other motorists. (Ord. 1334 § 9, 2018; Ord. 1174 § 1, 2008; Ord. 895 § 2, 1998; Ord. 703 § 1, 1993)

     3.     The golf cart must present an unobstructed view to the rear from the driver’s seat.

     4.     The golf cart must be equipped and safely operated with:

     a.     Brake lights;

     b.     Front and rear turn signal indicator lights;

     c.     Either left side and right side mirrors, left side and rear view mirrors, or a multidirectional cross bar rear mirror;

10.76.110 Golf cart operator safety criteria.
     A.    The city council finds that minimum golf cart operator safety criteria for golf cart use on golf cart lanes have been established by the city engineer, police captain and golf cart transportation committee.

     B.     The following safety criteria for operators are the minimum criteria set and adopted by the city council:

     1.     A golf cart operator must have a valid driver’s license issued by the state of California or an acceptable foreign jurisdiction or be physically disabled and determined to be able to operate an electric golf cart by their physician in writing and the city and to possess knowledge of traffic signals, signs, rules, laws, and safety sufficient to have obtained a driver’s license in the absence of the disability.

     2.     Golf cart operators must comply with the financial responsibility requirements of Vehicle Code Section 16020 et seq.

     3.     Golf cart operators must maintain golf cart in a safe condition and ensure that an unobstructed view to the rear is maintained at all times the cart is in operation on public streets.

     4.     Golf cart operators may only operate golf carts on public streets only during the time period between one hour prior to sunrise and one hour after sunset.

     5.     A maximum of four persons may ride in the golf cart and may only ride in the main passenger compartment equipped with safety belts. The driver and all passengers must wear safety belts at all times that the golf cart is being operated on public streets.

     d.     May not travel on, along or across state highways, except to cross at controlled intersections as designated in the golf cart transportation plan and indicated on the golf cart route map.

     7.     Golf cart permits issued by the city are valid only within, and designated golf cart routes do not extend beyond, the geographic boundaries of the city. Possession of a valid city golf cart permit does not authorize travel on or along public streets outside the geographic boundaries of the city. (Ord. 1334 § 10, 2018; Ord. 1174 § 3, 2008; Ord. 895 § 4, 1998; Ord. 703 § 1, 1993)

 

10.76.120 City permit process.
     A golf cart permit process has been established by the city council. Permitted golf carts must meet the minimum golf cart design criteria. Permitted golf cart operators must meet the minimum golf cart operator safety criteria. In addition, the city shall establish the following process for permitting golf carts:

     A.    An inspection process completed by the city;

     B.     A permit decal showing proof of compliance. The decal shall be visibly posted on the right rear fender of the permitted golf cart;

10.78.010 Purpose and intent.
     The purpose of this chapter is to protect public health, safety and welfare by prohibiting the use and operation of electronic personal assistive mobility devices (“EPAMD”), as defined in California Vehicle Code § 313 (as the same may be amended from time to time) within the El Paseo business district of the city of Palm Desert. The city council finds that the use and operation of EPAMDs on all sidewalks, walkways, and pathways in the El Paseo business district jeopardizes public health and safety because such use and operation puts pedestrians at risk of being injured or being forced off public sidewalks, walkways and pathways to avoid injury. (Ord. 1041A § 1, 2004)

     H.    EPAMD operators may not travel on or across state highways, except to cross at controlled intersections; and

10.78.050 City permit process.

10.92.020 Purpose.
     The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for terminal designation and truck route designated to terminals for interstate trucks operating on a federally designated highway system and to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the public. (Ord. 403 § 1, 1984)

 

10.92.030 Application.
     A.    Any interested person requiring terminal access for interstate trucks from the federally designated highway system shall submit an application, on a form as provided by the city, together with such information as may be required by the transportation engineer and appropriate fees to the city of Palm Desert.

     B.     Upon receipt of the application, the transportation engineer will cause an investigation to be made to ascertain whether or not the proposed terminal facility meets the requirements for an interstate truck terminal. Upon his approval of that designation, he will then determine the capability of the route requested and alternate routes, whether requested or not. Determination of route capability will include, without limitation, a review of adequate turning radius and lane widths of ramps, intersections and highways and general traffic conditions such as sight distance, speed and traffic volumes. No access off a federally designated highway system will be approved without the approval of Caltrans.

     C.     Should the requested route pass through the city of Palm Desert to a terminal located in another jurisdiction, the applicant shall comply with that jurisdictions’ application process. Coordination of the approval of the route through the city will be the responsibility of the entity which controls the terminal’s land use. Costs for trailblazer signs shall be as provided in Section 10.92.040. (Ord. 403 § 1, 1984)

 

10.92.040 Fees and costs.

Trailblazer signs will be required at every decision point in the city on route to the terminal. Upon completion of the installation of the signs, the actual cost shall be computed and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant, whichever the case may be. No terminal or route may be used until such signs as may be required are in place. Costs for trailblazer signs may be proportioned in accordance with the procedures in Section 10.92.040. (Ord. 403 § 1, 1984)

 

10.92.050 Retrofitting.
     A.    If all feasible routes to a requested terminal are found unsatisfactory by the transportation engineer, the applicant may request retrofitting the deficiencies. All costs of engineering, construction and inspection will be the responsibility by the applicant.

Adjustments between the estimated and actual cost shall be made after completion of the work and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant as the case may be. When the work is done by the applicant, the applicant may file with the transportation engineer, on a form satisfactory to the transportation engineer, a statement detailing the actual costs of the retrofitting.

     C.     If at any time within five years from the date of completion of the retrofitting by the applicant, should any applicant seek terminal approval which would use the route upon which such retrofitting was accomplished, any such applicants’ fee may include that applicant’s proportionate share of the retrofitting, as determined by the transportation engineer, which fee shall be disbursed by the city of Palm Desert to the applicant who paid for the retrofitting as well as to any applicant who contributed to the cost of retrofitting under this subsection. Nothing herein shall require the payment of a proportionate fee if the applicant doing the work failed to file the report with the transportation engineer required by subsection B above. (Ord. 403 § 1, 1984)

 

10.92.060 Revocation of route.
     The transportation engineer may revoke any approved terminal or route if the terminal or route becomes a traffic hazard for vehicular traffic. A safety hazard includes the inability of interstate trucks to negotiate the route or if such vehicles cause unsafe driving conditions for other vehicular traffic or pedestrians. (Ord. 403 § 1, 1984)

 

10.92.070 Appeal process.
     A.    If the transportation engineer denies terminal designation, route feasibility or revokes a previously approved terminal or route, the applicant/terminal owner, within ten days following the date of receipt of the decision of the transportation engineer may appeal the decision to the city council in writing. An appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the department of public works and shall be filed with the city clerk.

     The appeal shall state specifically wherein there was an error or abuse of discretion by the transportation engineer or wherein its decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. Within five days of the filing of an appeal, the transportation engineer shall transmit to the city clerk the terminal application, the sketches of the revoked route and all other data filed therewith, the report of the transportation engineer, the finding of the transportation engineer, and his decision on the application.

     B.     The city clerk shall make copies of the data provided by the transportation engineer available to the applicant and to the appellant (if the applicant is not the appellant) for inspection and may give notice to any other interested party who requested notice of the time when the appeal will be considered by the city council.

     C.     If Caltrans and not the transportation engineer denies or revokes terminal access from federally designated highways, no appeal may be made to the city council, but must be made to Caltrans as may be permitted by Caltrans. (Ord. 403 § 1, 1984)

 

10.92.080 Constitutionality.
     If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter is for any reason held to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter and each section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared invalid.

     2.     Any actual conflict with other scheduled park uses or events;

     3.     The necessity for careful and safe provision of electricity and the safety of individuals near such electrical sources.

     B.     The maximum sound level in the park shall be set at a seventy decibel average for any fifteen minute period. Sound levels shall be measured at specified points as determined by the city engineer to protect the health, safety and welfare of park users and adjacent residents.

Chapter 14.01 CABLE, VIDEO AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS

Chapter 14.01 CABLE, VIDEO AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS
Article 1. General Provisions
14.01.010 Title.
     This chapter is known and may be cited as the “cable, video and telecommunications service providers ordinance” of the city of Palm Desert. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2000)

 

14.01.020 Purpose and intent.
     A.    The city council finds and determines as follows:

     1.     The development of cable, video and telecommunications services and systems may provide significant benefits for, and have substantial impacts upon, the residents of the city.

     2.     Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable, video and telecommunications services and systems, the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers to be exercised by the city.

     3.     This chapter adopts provisions that authorize the city to regulate cable, video and telecommunications service providers to the extent authorized by federal and state law, including but not limited to the federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, the federal Cable Television Consumer and Competition Act of 1992, the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, and applicable California statutes and regulations.

     3.     To obtain fair and reasonable compensation for the city and its residents for authorizing the private use of the public rights-of-way and public property.

     4.     To promote competition in cable, video and telecommunications services, minimize unnecessary local regulation of cable, video and telecommunications service providers, and encourage the delivery of advanced and competitive cable, video and telecommunications services on the broadest possible basis to local government and to the businesses, institutions, and residents of the city.

     5.     To establish clear local guidelines, standards, and time frames for the exercise of local authority with respect to the regulation of cable, video and telecommunications service providers.

14.01.030 Defined terms and phrases.
     Various terms and phrases used in this chapter are defined in Section 14.01.170 of this chapter. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2000)

 

Article 2. Cable Television Systems
14.01.040 Authority and findings.
     A.    In accordance with applicable federal and state law, the city is authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, reconstruct, operate and maintain cable television systems within the city limits.

     B.     The city council finds that the development of cable television and related telecommunications services may provide significant benefits for, and substantial impacts upon, the residents of the city. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the city council further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers to be exercised by the city. This article is intended to specify the means for providing to the public the best possible cable television and related telecommunications services, and every franchise issued in accordance with this article is intended to achieve this primary objective. It is the further intent of this article to adopt regulatory provisions that will enable the city to regulate cable television and related telecommunications services to the maximum extent authorized by federal and state law. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2000)

 

14.01.050 Franchise terms and conditions.
     A.    Franchise Purposes. A franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this article may authorize the grantee to do the following:

     1.     To engage in the business of providing cable service and such other telecommunications services as may be authorized by law and which grantee elects to provide to its subscribers within the designated franchise service area.

     2.     To erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct, replace, maintain and retain, cable lines, related electronic equipment, supporting structures, appurtenances, and other property in connection with the operation of the cable system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across streets or other public places within the designated franchise service area.

     3.     To maintain and operate the franchise properties for the origination, reception, transmission, amplification and distribution of television and radio signals, and for the delivery of cable services and such other services as may be authorized by law.

     B.     Franchise Required.

     1.     It is unlawful for any person to construct, install, or operate a cable television system within any street or public way in the city without first obtaining a franchise under the provisions of this article.

     2.     The city council finds and determines that certain multichannel video programming distributors and video providers, as those terms are defined in Section 14.01.170 of this article, provide cable service, including video programming, to subscribers within limited geographic areas where multi-family dwelling complexes and congregate-living complexes are located. That cable service, including video programming, is sometimes provided, in whole or in part, by the transmission of signals over wires or lines that are owned or controlled by telecommunications service providers or other public utilities and that are within or cross streets or public ways within the boundaries of a local franchising authority. The multichannel video programming distributor or video provider may obtain from the telecommunications service provider or other public utility, by lease, license, or similar contractual arrangement, the right to use those wires or lines in order to provide cable service, including video programming, to subscribers or customers within the multi-family dwelling complexes and congregate-living complexes referenced above. The city council further finds and determines that these contractual arrangements for signal transmission facilitate the provision of cable service, including video programming, and create a nexus between that cable service and the use of the streets and public ways of the city. Consequently, to the maximum extent authorized under California law, it is the intent of the city council to subject multi-channel video programming distributors and video providers that intend to use this signal-transmission methodology to the franchise requirements set forth in this article, subject to such waivers and modifications of those requirements as may, in the discretion of the city council or its designee, be warranted in view of the limited geographic area that is proposed to be served.

     C.     Term of the Franchise.

     1.     A franchise granted under this article will be for the term specified in the franchise agreement, commencing upon the effective date of the ordinance or resolution adopted by the city council that authorizes the franchise.

     2.     A franchise granted under this article may be renewed upon application by the grantee in accordance with the then-applicable provisions of state and federal law and of this article.

     D.    Franchise Territory. A franchise is effective within the territorial limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the ordinance or resolution granting the franchise or in the franchise agreement.

     E.     Federal or State Jurisdiction. This article will be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and it applies to all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this chapter, to the extent authorized by applicable law.

     F.     Franchise Non-Transferable.

     1.     Grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation, or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the city council and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the city council, which consent may not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign, or otherwise dispose of the franchise without the consent of the city council is null and void. The granting of a security interest in any assets of the grantee, or any mortgage or other hypothecation, will not be deemed a transfer for the purposes of this subsection.

     2.     The requirements of subsection (F)(1) of this section apply to any change in control of grantee. The word “control” as used herein is not limited to the ownership of major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. If grantee or its ultimate parent corporation is a publicly-owned corporation, prior authorization of the city council is required where ownership or control of more than twenty percent of the voting stock of grantee or its ultimate parent corporation is acquired by a person or a group of persons acting in concert, none of whom, singularly or collectively, owns or controls the voting stock of the grantee or its ultimate parent corporation as of the effective date of the franchise.

     3.     Grantee must notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the grantee’s franchise property. That notification will be considered by the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place, and the provisions of this paragraph that require the prior consent of the city council to that change in control of ownership will apply.

     4.     For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to an acquisition, transfer, or change in control, the city may inquire as to the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee must assist the city in that inquiry. In seeking the city’s consent to any change of ownership or control, grantee or the proposed transferee, or both, must complete Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or its equivalent. This application must be submitted to the city not less than one hundred twenty days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee must establish that it possesses the legal, financial and technical capability to operate and maintain the cable system and to comply with all franchise requirements during the remaining term of the franchise. If the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the city will consent to the transfer of the franchise. The consent of the city to that transfer will not be unreasonably denied or delayed.

     5.     Any financial institution holding a pledge of the grantee’s assets to secure the advance of money for the construction or operation of the franchise property has the right to notify the city that it, or a designee satisfactory to the city, will take control of and operate the cable television system upon grantee’s default in its financial obligations. Further, that financial institution must also submit a plan for such operation within ninety days after assuming control. The plan must ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the period that the financial institution will exercise control over the system. The financial institution may not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless authorized by the city, in its sole discretion, and during that period of time it will have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another grantee.

     6.     Grantee must reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable review and processing expenses incurred in connection with any transfer or change in control of the franchise. These expenses include, without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by these experts), notice and publication costs, and document preparation expenses. No reimbursement may be offset against any franchise fee payable to the city during the term of the franchise.

     G.    Geographical Coverage.

     1.     Unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, grantee must design, construct and maintain the cable television system so as to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit and commercial building in the city, subject to any service-area line extension requirements of the franchise agreement.

     2.     After service has been established by activating trunk or distribution cables for any service area, grantee must provide service to any requesting subscriber in that service area within seven days from the date of request, provided that the grantee is able to secure on reasonable terms and conditions all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to that subscriber within that seven-day period.

     H.    Nonexclusive Franchise. Every franchise granted is nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable television system, or any component thereof, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law. If an additional franchise is proposed to be granted to a subsequent grantee, a noticed public hearing must first be held if it is required under the provisions of Government Code Section 53066.3.

     I.      Multiple Franchises.

     1.     The city may grant any number of franchises, subject to applicable state and federal law. The city may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as:

     a.     The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits, and pipes of the existing utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage.

     b.     The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service.

     c.     The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents’ property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations within the public rights-of-way.

     2.     The city may require that any new grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the associated costs if, in the city’s opinion, the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot reasonably accommodate additional cables. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2000)

 

14.01.060 Franchise applications and renewal.
     A.    Filing of Applications. Any person desiring an initial franchise for a cable television system must file an application with the city. A reasonable nonrefundable application fee in an amount established by resolution of the city council must accompany the application. That application fee will cover all costs associated with reviewing and processing the application, including without limitation costs of administrative review financial, legal and technical evaluation of the applicant, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by those experts), notice and publication requirements, and document preparation expenses. If those costs exceed the application fee, the applicant must pay the difference to the city within thirty days following receipt of an itemized statement of those costs.

     B.     Applications—Contents. An application for an initial franchise for a cable television system must contain, as applicable:

After relevant evidence and testimony is received, and staff reports are submitted, the city council will vote to either uphold or vacate the monetary penalty. The city council’s decision on the imposition of a monetary penalty shall be final.

     D.    City Response to State Video Franchise Applications.

     1.

     2.     The city will provide any appropriate comments to the California Public Utilities Commission regarding an application or an amendment to an application for a state video franchise.

     E.     PEG Channel Capacity. A state video franchise holder that uses the public rights-of-way shall designate sufficient capacity on its network to enable the carriage of at least three public, educational, or governmental (PEG) access channels.

     1.     PEG access channels shall be for the exclusive use of the city or its designees to provide public, educational, or governmental programming.

     2.     Advertising, underwriting, or sponsorship recognition may be carried on the PEG access channels for the purpose of funding PEG-related activities.

     3.     The PEG access channels shall be carried on the basic service tier.

     4.     To the extent feasible, the PEG access channels shall not be separated numerically from other channels carried on the basic service tier, and the channel numbers for the PEG access channels shall be the same channel numbers used by the incumbent cable operator unless prohibited by federal law.

     5.     After the initial designation of PEG access channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be changed without the prior written consent of the city, unless the change is required by federal law.

     6.     Each PEG access channel shall be capable of carrying a National Television System Committee (NTSC) television signal.

     F.     Interconnection. Where technically feasible, a state video franchise holder and incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their networks for the purpose of providing PEG access channel programming. Interconnection may be accomplished by direct cable, microwave link, satellite, or other reasonable method of connection. State video franchise holders and incumbent cable operators shall provide interconnection of the PEG access channels on reasonable terms and conditions and may not withhold the interconnection. If a state video franchise holder and an incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection agreement, the city may require the incumbent cable operator to allow the state video franchise holder to interconnect its network with the incumbent’s network at a technically feasible point on the holder’s network as identified by the holder. If no technically-feasible point for interconnection is available, the state video franchise holder shall make an interconnection available to the channel originator and shall provide the facilities necessary for the interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by the state video franchise holder requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.

     G.    Emergency Alert System And Emergency Overrides. A state video franchise holder must comply with the Emergency Alert System requirements of the Federal Communications Commission in order that emergency messages may be distributed over the holder’s network. Provisions in city-issued franchises authorizing the city to provide local emergency notifications shall remain in effect, and shall apply to all state video franchise holders in the city for the duration of the city-issued franchise, or until the term of the franchise would have expired had it not been terminated pursuant to subdivision (m) of Section 5840 of the California Public Utilities Code, or until January 1, 2009, whichever is later.

     Within thirty days after receipt of an application filed under Section 14.01.100 that is deemed to be complete, the city manager will give written notice to the applicant of the city’s intent to negotiate an agreement setting forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open video system will be authorized by the city. The commencement of those negotiations will be on a date that is mutually acceptable to the city and to the applicant. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2000)

 

 

14.01.120 Agreement required.
     A.    No video programming services may be provided in the city by an open video system operator unless the operator and the city have executed a written agreement, which may be designated as a franchise, setting forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open video system will be authorized by the city.

     B.     The agreement between the city and the open video system operator may contain terms and conditions that relate to the following subject matters, to the extent that such terms, conditions, and subject matters are not preempted by federal statute or regulations:

     1.     The nature, scope and duration of the agreement, including provisions for its renewal or extension.

     2.     The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the city, at specified times, fees on the gross revenue received by the operator, as authorized by 47 CFR Section 76.1511, in accordance with the following standards and procedures:

     a.     The amount of the fees on the gross revenue will be five percent, and will be paid in lieu of the franchise fees authorized under Section 622 of the Communications Act.

     b.     The term “gross revenue” means (i) all gross revenue received by an open video system operator or its affiliates, including all revenue received from subscribers and all carriage revenue received from unaffiliated video programming providers; and (ii) all advertising revenue received by the operator or its affiliates in connection with the provision of video programming, where such revenue is included in the, calculation of the cable franchise fee paid to the city by the franchised cable operator. The term “gross revenue” does not include revenue, such as subscriber or advertising revenue, collected by unaffiliated video programming providers.

     3.     The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with requirements relating to information collection and recordkeeping, accounting procedures, reporting, periodic audits and inspection of records in order to ensure the accuracy of the fees on the gross revenue that are required to be paid as specified in subsection (B)(2) of this section.

     4.     The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the city’s requirements with respect to public, educational and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities and equipment, as provided for in 47 CFR Section 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and procedures apply:

     a.     The open video system operator is subject to the same public, educational and governmental access requirements that apply within the cable television franchise service area with which its system overlaps.

     b.     The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers receive all public, educational and governmental access channels within the franchise service area in which the city’s subscribers are located.

     c.     The open video system operator may negotiate with the city to establish the operator’s obligations with respect to public, educational and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities and equipment. These negotiations may include the city’s franchised cable operator if the city, the open video system operator and the franchised cable operator so desire.

     d.     If the open video system operator and the city are unable to reach an agreement regarding the operator’s obligations with respect to public, educational and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities and equipment within the city’s jurisdiction, then the following obligations will be imposed:

     i.      The open video system operator must satisfy the same public, educational and governmental access obligations as the city’s franchised cable operator by providing the same amount of channel capacity for public, educational and governmental access and by matching the city’s franchised cable operator’s annual financial contributions in support of public, educational and governmental access services, facilities and equipment that are actually used by the city. For in-kind contributions, such as cameras or production studios, the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory obligation by negotiating mutually agreeable terms with the city’s franchised cable operator, so that public, educational and governmental access services to the city are improved or increased. If such terms cannot be agreed upon, the open video system operator must pay to the city the monetary equivalent of the franchised cable operator’s depreciated in-kind contribution, or, in the case of facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions provided by the open video system operator must be used to fund activities arising under Section 611 of the Communications Act.

     ii.     The city will impose upon the open video system operator the same rules and procedures that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator with regard to the open video system operator’s use of channel capacity designated for public, educational and governmental access use when that capacity is not being used for such purposes.

     e.     The city’s franchised cable operator is required under federal law to permit the open video system operator to connect with its public, educational and governmental access channel feeds. The open video system operator and the franchised cable operator may decide how to accomplish this connection, taking into consideration the physical and technical characteristics of the cable and the open video systems involved. If the franchised cable operator and the open video system operator cannot agree on how to accomplish the connection, the city has the right to decide. The city may require that the connection occur on city-owned property or on public rights-of-way.

     f.      All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator’s public, educational and governmental access channel feed must be borne by the open video system operator. These costs will be counted towards the open video system operator’s matching financial contributions set forth above in subsection (d)(i) of this section.

     g.     The city will not impose upon the open video system operator any public, educational or governmental access obligations that are greater than those imposed upon the franchised cable operator.

     h.     If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the provisions of 47 CFR Section 76.1505(d) (6) will be applicable in determining the obligations of the open video system operator.

     i.      The open video system operator must adjust its system to comply with new public, educational and access obligations imposed on the city’s franchised cable operator following a renewal of the cable television franchise; provided, however, that the open video system operator will not be required to displace other programmers using its open video system to accommodate public, educational and governmental access channels. The open video system operator must comply with those new public, educational and governmental access obligations whenever additional capacity is or becomes available, whether it is due to increased channel capacity or to decreased demand for channel capacity.

     5.     If the city and the open video system operator cannot agree on the application of the FCC’s rules regarding the open video system operator’s obligations to provide public, educational and governmental access under the provisions of subsection (B)(4) of this section, then either party may file a complaint with the FCC in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in 47 CFR Section 76.1514. No agreement will be executed by the city until the dispute has been finally resolved.

     6.     If the open video system operator intends to maintain an institutional network, as defined in Section 611(f) of the Communications Act, the city will require that educational and governmental access channels be designated on that institutional network to the same extent that those channels are designated on the institutional network of the city’s franchised cable operator. In addition, to the extent authorized by federal law, the open video system operator may be required by the city to satisfy the same financial obligations and other requirements that are imposed upon the franchised cable operator to support data-transmission and related services that are provided by the institutional network.

     7.     The authority of an open video system provider to exercise editorial control over any public, educational or governmental use of channel capacity will be restricted in accordance with the provisions of 47 CFR Section 76.1505(f).

     8.     The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with all applicable federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations relating to customer service standards, including the Cable Television and Video Customer Service and Information Act (Government Code Sections 53054, et seq.), the Video Customer Service Act (Government Code Sections 53088, et seq.) and Section 14.01.080 of this chapter.

     9.     If new physical plant is proposed to be constructed within the city, the obligation of the open video system operator to comply with the following rights-of-way use and management responsibilities that are also imposed by the city upon other video and telecommunications service providers in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner:

     a.     Compliance with all applicable city codes, including applications for excavation, encroachment and construction permits and the payment of all required permit and inspection fees.

     b.     The coordination of construction activities.

     c.     Compliance with established standards and procedures for constructing lines across private property.

     d.     Compliance with all applicable insurance and indemnification requirements.

     e.     The repair and resurfacing of construction-damaged streets.

     f.      Compliance with all public safety requirements that are applicable to video and telecommunications service providers using public property or public rights-of-way.

     10.   Acts or omissions constituting breaches or defaults of the agreement and the applicable penalties, liquidated damages and other remedies, including fines or the suspension, revocation or termination of the agreement.

     11.   Requirements relating to the sale, assignment or transfer of control of the open video system.

     12.   Requirements relating to the open video system operator’s compliance with and implementation of state and federal laws, rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of the open video system.

     13.   Such additional requirements, conditions, terms, policies and procedures as may be mutually agreed upon by the city and the open video system operator and that will, in the judgment of the city council, best serve the public interest and protect the public health, welfare and safety. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2000)

 

Article 4. Other Video and Telecommunications Services and Systems
14.01.130 Other multichannel video programming distributors.
     The term “cable system,” as defined in federal law and as set forth in Section 14.01.170 of this chapter, does not include a facility that serves subscribers without using any public rights-of-way. Consequently, the categories of multichannel video programming distributors identified below are not deemed to be “cable systems” and are therefore exempt from the city’s franchise, lease and license requirements and from certain other local regulatory provisions authorized by federal law, provided that their distribution or transmission facilities do not involve the use of the city’s public rights-of-way.

     A.    Multichannel multipoint distribution service (“MMDS”), also known as “wireless cable,” which typically involves the transmission by an FCC-licensed operator of numerous broadcast stations from a central location using line-of-sight technology.

     B.     Local multipoint distribution service (“LMDS”), another form of over-the-air wireless video service for which licenses are auctioned by the FCC and which offers video programming, telephony and data networking services.

     C.     Direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”), also referred to as “direct-to-home satellite services,” which involves the distribution or broadcasting of programming or services by satellite directly to the subscriber’s premises without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment, except at the subscriber’s premises or in the uplink process to the satellite. Local regulation of direct-to-home satellite services is further proscribed by the following federal statutory provisions:

     1.     47 U.S.C. Section 303(v) confers upon the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the provision of direct-to- home satellite services.

     2.     Section 602 of the Communications Act states that a provider of direct-to-home satellite service is exempt from the collection or remittance, or both, of any tax or fee imposed by any local taxing jurisdiction on direct-to-home satellite service. The terms “tax” and “fee” are defined by federal statute to mean any local sales tax, local use tax, local intangible tax, local income tax, business license tax, utility tax, privilege tax, gross receipts tax, excise tax, franchise fees, local telecommunications tax or any other tax, license or fee that is imposed for the privilege of doing business, regulating or raising revenue for a local taxing jurisdiction. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2000)

 

14.01.140 Video providers—Registration— Customer service standards.
     A.    Unless the customer protection and service obligations of a video provider, as that term is defined in Section 14.01.170 of this chapter, are specified in a franchise, license, lease or similar written agreement with the city, a video provider must comply with all applicable provisions of the following state statutes:

     iii. A description of the rights and remedies that the video provider may make available to its customers if the video provider does not materially meet its customer service standards;

     2.     All video provider personnel contacting subscribers or potential subscribers outside the office of the provider must be clearly identified as associated with the video provider.

     3.     At the time of installation, and annually thereafter, all video providers must provide to all customers a written notice of the programming offered, the prices for that programming, the provider’s installation and customer service policies, and the name, address and telephone number of the city’s office that is designated for receiving complaints.

     4.     All video providers must have knowledgeable, qualified company representatives available to respond to customer telephone inquiries Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, during normal business hours.

     6.     All video providers must render bills that are accurate and understandable.

     7.     All video providers must respond promptly to a complete outage in a customer’s service. The response must occur within twenty-four hours of the reporting of that outage to the provider, except in those situations beyond the reasonable control of the video provider. A video provider will be deemed to respond to a complete outage when a company representative arrives at the outage location within twenty-four hours and begins to resolve the problem.

     8.     All video providers must provide a minimum of thirty days’ written notice before increasing rates or deleting channels. All video providers must make every reasonable effort to submit the notice to the city in advance of its distribution to customers. The thirty-day notice is waived if the increases in rates or deletion of channels are outside the control of the video provider. In those cases, the video provider must make reasonable efforts to provide customers with as much notice as possible.

     9.     All video providers must allow every residential customer who pays his or her bill directly to the video provider at least fifteen days from the date the bill for services is mailed to the customer, to pay the listed charges unless otherwise agreed to pursuant to a residential rental agreement establishing tenancy. Customer payments must be posted promptly. No video provider may terminate residential service for nonpayment of a delinquent account unless the video provider furnishes notice of the delinquency and impending termination at least fifteen days prior to the proposed termination. The notice must be mailed, postage prepaid, to the customer to whom the service is billed. Notice must not be mailed until the sixteenth day after the date the bill for services was mailed to the customer. The notice of delinquency and impending termination may be part of a billing statement. No video provider may assess a late fee any earlier than the twenty-second day after the bill for service has been mailed.

     10.   Every notice of termination of service pursuant to subsection (C)(9) of this section must include all of the following information:

     a.     The name and address of the customer whose account is delinquent;

     d.     The telephone number of a representative of the video provider who can provide additional information and handle complaints or initiate an investigation concerning the service and charges in question.

     11.   Any service terminated without good cause must be restored without charge for the service restoration. Good cause includes, but is not limited to, failure to pay, payment by check for which there are insufficient funds, theft of service, abuse of equipment or system personnel, or other similar subscriber actions.

     12.   All video providers must issue requested refund checks promptly, but no later than forty-five days following the resolution of any dispute, and following the return of the equipment supplied by the video provider, if service is terminated.

     14.   Video providers must not disclose the name and address of a subscriber for commercial gain to be used in mailing lists or for other commercial purposes not reasonably related to the conduct of the businesses of the video providers or their affiliates, unless the video providers have provided to the subscriber a notice, separate or included in any other customer notice, that clearly and conspicuously describes the subscriber’s ability to prohibit that disclosure. Video providers must provide an address and telephone number for a local subscriber to use without toll charge to prevent disclosure of the subscriber’s name and address.

     D.    As authorized by Government Code Section 53088(q), the following schedule of penalties is adopted. These penalties may be imposed for the material breach by a video provider of the consumer protection and service standards that are set forth in subsection C of this section, provided that the breach is within the reasonable control of the video provider. These penalties are in addition to any other remedies authorized by this chapter or by any other law and the city has discretion to elect the remedy that it will apply. The imposition of penalties authorized by this subsection will not prevent the city or any other affected party from exercising any other remedy to the extent permitted by law, including but not limited to any judicial remedy as provided in subsection (D)(2) of this section.

     1.     Schedule of Penalties.

     a.     For a first material breach: the maximum penalty is two hundred dollars for each day of material breach, but not to exceed a cumulative total of six hundred dollars for each occurrence of material breach, irrespective of the number of customers affected.

     b.     For a second material breach of the same nature for which a monetary penalty was previously assessed within the preceding twelve-month period: the maximum penalty is four hundred dollars per day, not to exceed a cumulative total of one thousand two hundred dollars for each occurrence of the material breach, irrespective of the number of customers affected.

     c.     For a third or further material breach of the same nature for which a monetary penalty was previously assessed within the preceding twelve-month period: the maximum penalty is one thousand dollars per day, not to exceed a cumulative total of three thousand dollars for each occurrence of the material breach, irrespective of the number of customers affected.

     d.     For the failure of a video provider to distribute the annual notice required by Government Code 53055.1: the maximum penalty is five hundred dollars for each year in which the notice is not distributed as required by state statute.

     e.     The maximum penalties referenced above may be increased by any additional amount authorized by state law.

     2.     Judicial Remedies Not Affected. The imposition of penalties in accordance with the provisions of subsection (D)(1) of this section does not preclude any affected party from pursuing any judicial remedy that is available to that party.

     3.     Administration, Notice and Appeal.

     a.     The city manager or the city manager’s designee is authorized to administer this subsection. Decisions by the city manager to assess penalties against a video provider must be in writing and must contain findings supporting the decisions. Decisions by the city manager are final, unless appealed to the city council.

     b.     If the video provider or any interested person is aggrieved by a decision of the city manager, the aggrieved party may, within ten days of the written decision, appeal that decision in writing to the city council. The appeal letter must be accompanied by the fee established by the city council for processing the appeal. The city council may affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the city manager.

     c.     The imposition of monetary penalties under subsection (D)(1) of this section is subject to the following requirements and limitations:

     i.      The city must give the video provider written notice of any alleged material breach and must allow the video provider at least thirty days from receipt of that notice to remedy the breach.

     ii.     For the purpose of assessing monetary penalties, a material breach will be deemed to have occurred for each day, following the expiration of the period for cure specified in subsection (D)(3)(c)(i) of this section, that the material breach has not been remedied by the video provider, irrespective of the number of customers affected. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2000)

 

14.01.150 Antennas for video and telecommunications services.
     Chapter 25.104 of this code sets forth the city’s regulatory requirements relating to the siting and construction of commercial communication towers and antennas that are commonly used in providing or receiving video and telecommunications services. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2000)

 

14.01.160 Telecommunications service provided by telephone corporations.
     A.    The city council finds and determines as follows:

     1.     The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempts and declares invalid all state rules that restrict entry or limit competition in both local and long-distance telephone service.

     2.     The California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) is primarily responsible for the implementation of local telephone competition, and it issues certificates of public convenience and necessity to new entrants that are qualified to provide competitive local telephone exchange services and related telecommunications service, whether using their own facilities or the facilities or services provided by other authorized telephone corporations.

     3.     Section 234(a) of the California Public Utilities Code defines a “telephone corporation” as “every corporation or person owning, controlling, operating or managing any telephone line for compensation within this state.”

     4.     Section 616 of the California Public Utilities Code provides that a telephone corporation “may condemn any property necessary for the construction and maintenance of its telephone line.”

     5.     Section 2902 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes municipal corporations to retain their powers of control to supervise and regulate the relationships between a public utility and the general public in matters affecting the health, convenience and safety of the general public, including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public utility and the location of the poles, wires, mains or conduits of any public utility on, under or above any public streets.

     6.     Section 7901 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes telephone and telegraph corporations to construct telephone or telegraph lines along and upon any public road or highway, along or across any of the waters or lands within this state and to erect poles, posts, piers or abutments for supporting the insulators, wires and other necessary fixtures of their lines, in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.

     7.     Section 7901.1 of the California Public Utilities Code confirms the right of municipalities to exercise reasonable control as to the time, place and manner in which roads, highways and waterways are accessed, which control must be applied to all entities in an equivalent manner and may involve the imposition of fees.

     8.     Section 50030 of the California Government Code provides that any permit fee imposed by a city for the placement, installation, repair or upgrading of telecommunications facilities, such as lines, poles or antennas, by a telephone corporation that has obtained all required authorizations from the CPUC and the FCC to provide telecommunications services, must not exceed the reasonable costs of providing the service for which the fee is charged, and must not be levied for general revenue purposes.

     B.     In recognition of and in compliance with the statutory authorizations and requirements set forth in subsection A of this section, the following regulatory provisions are applicable to a telephone corporation that desires to provide telecommunications service by means of facilities that are proposed to be constructed within the city’s public rights-of-way:

     1.     The telephone corporation must apply for and obtain, as may be applicable, an excavation permit, an encroachment permit or a building permit (“ministerial permit”).

     2.     In addition to the information required by this code in connection with an application for a ministerial permit, a telephone corporation must submit to the city the following supplemental information:

     a.     A copy of the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the CPUC to the applicant and a copy of the CPUC decision that authorizes the applicant to provide the telecommunications service for which the facilities are proposed to be constructed in the city’s public rights-of-way.

     b.     If the applicant has obtained from the CPUC a certificate of public convenience to operate as a “competitive local carrier,” the following additional requirements are applicable:

     i.      As required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC, the applicant must establish that it has filed with the city in a timely manner a quarterly report that describes the type of construction and the location of each construction project proposed to be undertaken in the city during the calendar quarter in which the application is filed, which information is sufficient to enable the city to coordinate multiple projects, as may be necessary.

     ii.     If the applicant’s proposed construction project will extend beyond the utility rights-of-way into undisturbed areas or other rights-of-way, the applicant must establish that it has filed a petition with the CPUC to amend its certificate of public convenience and necessity and that the proposed construction project has been subjected to a full-scale environmental analysis by the CPUC, as required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC.

     iii. The applicant must inform the city whether its proposed construction project will be subject to any of the mitigation measures specified in the negative declaration (“competitive local carriers (CLCs) projects for local exchange communication service throughout California”) or to the mitigation monitoring plan adopted in connection with Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC. The city’s issuance of a ministerial permit will be conditioned upon the applicant’s compliance with all applicable mitigation measures and monitoring requirements imposed by the CPUC upon telephone corporations that are designated as “competitive local carriers.”

     C.     In recognition of the fact that numerous excavations in the public rights-of-way diminish the useful life of the surface pavement and for the purpose of mitigating the adverse impacts of numerous excavations on the quality and longevity of public street maintenance within the city, the following policies and procedures are adopted:

     1.     The city manager is directed to ensure that all public utilities, including telephone corporations, comply with all local design, construction, maintenance and safety standards that are contained within, or are related to, a ministerial permit that authorizes the construction of facilities within the public rights-of-way.

     2.     The city manager is directed to coordinate the construction and installation of facilities by public utilities, including telephone corporations, in order to minimize the number of excavations in the public rights-of-way. In this regard, based upon projected plans for street construction or renovation projects, the city manager is authorized to establish on a quarterly basis one or more construction time periods or “windows” for the installation of facilities within the public rights-of-way. Telephone corporations and other public utilities that submit applications for ministerial permits to construct facilities after a predetermined date may be required to delay such construction until the next quarterly “window” that is established by the city. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2000)

     Section 65850.5 of the California Government Code provides that in developing an expedited permitting process, the city, county, or city and county shall adopt a checklist of all requirements with which small rooftop solar energy systems shall comply to be eligible for expedited review. The building official is hereby authorized and directed to develop and adopt such checklist. As required by Section 65850.5, the small residential rooftop solar energy system permit process to be adopted by the building official, including the standard plan(s), and checklist(s), shall substantially conform to recommendations for expedited permitting contained in the most current version of the California Solar Permitting Guidebook adopted by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research.

     The checklist shall be published on the city’s Internet website. The applicant may submit the permit application and associated documentation to the city’s building division by personal, mailed, or electronic submittal together with any required permit processing and inspection fees. In the case of electronic submittal, the electronic signature of the applicant on all forms, applications and other documentation may be used in lieu of a wet signature.

     Prior to submitting an application, the applicant shall:

     A.    Verify to the applicant’s reasonable satisfaction through the use of standard engineering evaluation techniques that the support structure for the small residential rooftop solar energy system is stable and adequate to transfer all wind, seismic, and dead and live loads associated with the system to the building foundation; and

     B.     At the applicant’s cost, verify to the applicant’s reasonable satisfaction using standard electrical inspection techniques that the existing electrical system including ex-

isting line, load, ground and bonding wiring as well as main panel and subpanel sizes are adequately sized, based on the existing electrical system’s current use, to carry all new photovoltaic electrical loads.

     For a small residential rooftop solar energy system eligible for expedited review, only one inspection shall be required, which shall be done in a timely manner and may include a consolidated inspection by the building official and fire chief.

Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the building official shall issue a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance.

     Upon confirmation by the building official of the application and supporting documentation being complete and meeting the requirements of the checklist, the building official shall, in a timely manner, administratively approve the application and issue all required permits or authorizations. Such approval does not authorize an applicant to connect the small residential rooftop energy system to the local utility provider’s electricity grid. The applicant is responsible for obtaining such approval or permission from the local utility provider.

     A city, county, or city and county shall not condition approval for any solar energy system permit on the approval of a solar energy system by an association, as that term is defined in Section 4080 of the Civil Code. (Ord. 1288 § 1, 2015)

     4.     Riverside County has an arid climate with annual rainfall varying from three inches in Blythe to over thirty-three  inches in Pine Cove. The County also experiences annual hot, dry Santa Ana Winds, which contribute to fires spreading quickly throughout the County.

     5.     A variety of regions exist within Riverside County including deserts, mountains, brush covered wild lands, the Salton Sea and agricultural lands. Additionally, elevations within Riverside County range from three hundred feet below sea level to mountains over ten thousand feet. This variety in regions contributes to an increased emergency response time, which necessitates cooperation between local agencies.

     6.     Riverside County contains a large number of sensitive habitats for various species and vegetation, consists of large open space areas between major urban centers and includes landscapes varying from mountains and hills to valleys and deserts. These conditions impact building and structure location, which impedes emergency access and response.

     7.     Riverside County extends from Orange County to the state of Arizona and is mixed with congested urban areas, rural lands and wild lands, which increase Riverside County Fire Department response times to emergencies.

     8.     Two major earthquake faults, the San Andreas Fault and the San Jacinto Fault, bisect Riverside County and numerous minor faults exist throughout it. As a result, a substantial amount of property and persons located in Riverside County are likely to be impacted by earthquakes and will require emergency response and rescue.

     9.     The topography within Riverside County extends from flat to twenty-five percent slope for habitable land, which causes buildings and structures to be located in unique areas that impact emergency response and access.

     10.   In addition to earthquakes, a substantial amount of property and persons located in Riverside County are likely to be impacted by landslides, wind erosion, blown sand, flooding and wildfires because of the County’s unique climatic, geological and topographical conditions.

     11.   The additional requirements included herein are necessary to properly protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents and workers of Riverside County.

     12.   Revenue shortages make it difficult to locate additional fire stations and provide staffing sufficient to control fires in single and multi-story retail, commercial and industrial buildings, making enhanced built-in protection necessary.

     13.   The sections of the California Fire Code may be referred to by the same number used in said published compilation preceded by the words “Riverside County Fire Code Section” or “Fire Code Section.”

     If the city council determines that in its judgment there will be a shortage in the redemption fund, it shall direct the treasurer to pay to the holders of all outstanding and unpaid bonds such proportion thereof as the amount of funds on hand bears to the total amount of the unpaid principal of the bonds and the interest which has accrued or will accrue thereon. Similar proportionate payments shall thereafter be made periodically as moneys come into the redemption fund. (Ord. 1175 §1, 2008)

Thereupon the treasurer shall by warrant pay to each holder the proportionate amount of principal and accrued interest due on his or her bonds as may be available from time to time out of the money in the redemption fund. Interest shall cease on payments made on account of principal from the date of payment, but interest shall continue to run on the unpaid principal at the rate specified in the bonds until payment thereof be made. No premiums shall be paid on payments made in advance of the due date. If bonds are not surrendered for registration and payment the treasurer shall give notice to the holder thereof by registered mail, at the holder’s address as last known to the treasurer, of the amount available for payment. Thereupon interest shall cease as to the amount so available for payment ten days from the date of mailing of the notice. (Ord. 1175 §1, 2008)

     If a deficiency occurs in the redemption fund with which to pay past due bonds, past due interest, or bonds or interest which will become due during the current tax collecting year, but it does not appear to the treasurer that there will be an ultimate loss to the bondholders, the treasurer shall pay matured bonds as presented and make interest payments when due as long as there are available funds in the redemption fund, in accordance with the provisions of the trust indenture. (Ord. 1175 §1, 2008)

 

17.09.060 Notice to holders of registered bonds—Failure to present for payment.
     When funds become available for the payment of any bond which was not paid upon presentment, the treasurer shall notify the holder thereof by registered mail to present the bond for payment. If the bond is not presented for payment within ten days after the mailing of the notice, interest shall cease to run on the bond. (Ord. 1175 §1, 2008)

Chapter 17.10 SPECIAL RESERVE FUND
17.10.010 Creation—Amount.

17.10.040 Availability of fund for transfer to redemption fund—Reimbursement from proceeds of redemption or sale.
     The money in the special reserve fund shall be available for transfer into the redemption fund for the bonds. The amount so advanced shall be reimbursed from the proceeds of redemption or sale of the parcel for which payment of delinquent installments was made from the special reserve fund. (Ord. 1175 §1, 2008)

 

17.10.050 Payment of assessment—Transfer to redemption fund of amount equal to assessment reduction.
     Whenever a contractual assessment is paid off following the issuance of bonds, there shall be transferred, from the special reserve fund to the redemption fund, an amount equal to the reduction in the contractual assessment determined pursuant to Section 17.10.020. (Ord. 1175 §1, 2008)

 

17.10.060 Adequacy of fund to retire bonds—Discontinuance of principal and interest collection—Liquidation—Disposition of excess.
     Provided that the amount to create the special reserve fund was included in the contractual assessment, whenever the balance in the special reserve fund is sufficient to retire all remaining outstanding bonds in the issue, whether by advance retirement or otherwise, collection of the principal and interest on the contractual assessments shall be discontinued and the special reserve fund shall be liquidated in retirement of the bonds.

     In the event that the balance in the fund at the time of liquidation exceeds the amount required to retire all outstanding bonds in the issue or series, the excess shall be apportioned to each parcel upon which the individual contractual assessment remained unpaid at the time the balance in the special reserve fund was sufficient to retire all outstanding bonds in the issue. The payments shall be made in cash to the respective owners of the parcels except that, if the excess is not greater than one thousand dollars, the excess may be transferred to the general fund of the city. (Ord. 1175 §1, 2008)

 

17.10.070 Temporary investments.
     Money in the special reserve fund may be temporarily invested in any authorized investments pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 53600) of Chapter 4 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code, or in any authorized investments pursuant to law.

     Any income realized from such investments shall be credited to the special reserve fund, and any loss or expense resulting from such investment shall be charged to that fund. (Ord. 1175 §1, 2008)

 

17.10.080 Use of fund—Assessment credit—Advance bond retirement.
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, for the purposes of providing for reduction of the amount of money in the special reserve fund during the term of the bonds, the city council may, by trust indenture or resolution adopted prior to the issuance of bonds under this title, provide that money in the special reserve fund, including investment income, shall be used, in the amounts and at the times as the city council may determine, for either or both of the following:

     A.    Credit upon the contractual assessment in the manner provided in the trust indenture;

     B.     Transfer to the redemption fund for advance retirement of the bonds pursuant to this title.

Chapter 17.11 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
17.11.010 Errors in computation of amount due.
     No bond, contractual assessment, or installment thereof or of the interest or penalties thereon, or declaration of default or deed shall be held invalid for any error in the computation of the proper amount due on the same, if the error is found to be comparatively negligible, or is found to be in favor of the owner of the real property affected thereby.

All outdoor lighting used for, but not limited to, walkways, parking lots, equipment yards, outdoor secur ity, outdoor retail or restaurant areas, automotive dealers (display areas only), assembly or repair areas, recreational facilities and similar applications where the use of the space or area requires accurate color rendition and light for ease of movement.

     Glare. The lighting from a single or multiple lighting fixtures that causes one of the following conditions:

     1.     Produces sufficiently greater luminance (light) in an area to which the eyes are adapted to. This is known as discomfort glare.

     2.     Produces sufficiently greater luminance (light) in an area which causes visual performance loss and visibility. This is known as disability glare.

     High Intensity Discharge (HID) Lamp. In a discharge lamp, the emitted energy (light) is produced by the passage of an electric current through a gas. High-intensity discharge includes mercury, metal halide, and high pressure sodium lamps. Other discharge lamps are LPS and fluorescent. Some such lamps have internal coatings to convert some of the ultraviolet energy emitted by the gas discharge into visual output.

     High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) Lamp. A gas-discharge lamp that uses sodium in an excited state to produce light. There are two varieties of such lamps: low pressure and high pressure. Low-pressure sodium lamps are the most efficient electrical light sources, but their yellow light restricts applications to outdoor lighting such as street lamps. High-pressure sodium lamps have a broader spectrum of light than the low pressure, but still poorer color rendering than other types of lamps. Low pressure sodium lamps only give monochromatic yellow light and so inhibit color vision at night.

     IESNA. Illuminating Engineering Society of North America.

     Incandescent Lamp. Light is produced by a filament heated to a high temperature by electric current. These lamps include MR lamps, tungsten halogen lamps, PAR and R lamps. EISA 2007 set new performance requirements for certain common light bulbs, requiring that these bulbs become approximately twenty-five to thirty percent more efficient than the light bulbs by 2012-2014. Overall, the intent of this is to bring into the market more efficient light bulbs. Some new incandescent products could be introduced by the effective dates of the law, including a bulb by General Electric that will decrease the amount of energy required. Non-incandescent bulbs, such as compact fluorescent (CFL) and light emitting diodes (LED) already meet the Tier I standards introduced.

     Induction Lighting. The internal electrode less lamp or induction light is a gas discharge lamp in which the power required to generate light is transferred from outside the lamp envelope to the gas inside via an electric or magnetic field, in contrast with a typical gas discharge lamp that uses internal electrodes connected to the power supply by conductors that pass through the lamp envelope.

     Installed. Any legal installation of outdoor light fixtures after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

     Light Emitting Diode (LED) Source. An electronic semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it. They are considerably more efficient than traditional light bulbs and provide for long lamp life. LEDs are used in many applications such as flat-screen video displays, indoor and exterior lighting fixtures.

     Light Pollution. An unwanted effect of manmade outdoor lighting that contributes to the effects of sky glow, light trespass, and/or glare.

     Light Trespass. An undesirable condition in which exterior light is cast where it is not wanted.

     Luminaire. A complete lighting unit consisting of a lamp or lamps and the parts designed to distribute the light, to position and protect the lamp(s), and to connect the lamp(s) to the power supply. (Also referred to as fixture.) The complete lighting unit, including the lamp, the fixture, and other parts.

     Mercury Lamp. The mercury vapor lamp is a high intensity discharge lamp. It uses an arc through vaporized mercury in a high pressure tube to create very bright light directly from its own arc. Mercury lamps are not approved in the city of Palm Desert.

     Metal-Halide Lamp. This type of lamp is also known as an MH lamp. It is an HID lamp (high intensity discharge), which means it provides most of its light from the electric arc within a small discharge tube. It is becoming increasingly popular due to its good quality white light and good efficiency. The most prominent use of the MH lamp is in stadiums and sports fields. It is also used widely for parking lots and street lighting in urban areas.

     Mounting Height. The distance from the finished grade to the top of the lighting fixtures including any lighting fixture foundation.

     Municipal. An area, street or facility which is owned or managed by the city of Palm Desert or is associated with a city of Palm Desert facility such as parks, recreation facilities or a city-owned or managed building such as City Hall.

     New Development Area. Any development in previously unimproved areas. This includes new developments generally recognized as planned housing, industrial or commercial developments.

     Non-Cutoff. A luminaire having a light distribution in which no limitation of light intensity occurs above ninety degrees above nadir.

     Off-Street Lighting. Lighting for off-street parking in public, private, municipal or restricted parking areas. All lighting positioned off the street in public and private properties, i.e., parking lots, building lighting, walkway lighting, parks, and fenced yards.

     Outdoor Light Fixture. Any lighting product intended and designed for outdoor use to provide illumination of a defined area or subject.

     Parking Area. An area, other than a public street, designed or used primarily for parking.

     Pedestrian Scale. A luminaire mounted at no more than ten feet above finished grade and intended to illuminate a walking path or small pedestrian area.

     Photometry or Photometric. The quantitative measurement of light level and distribution. This information is developed with programs designed to illustrate foot-candles numerically on a project site plan.

     Plasma Lighting (LEP). Plasma lamps are a type of gas discharge lamp energized by radio frequency (RF) power which produce high illuminance for exterior applications such as streets, large big box parking lots and sports lighting applications. The LEP lamps have a life ranging from thirty thousand to fifty thousand hours, a CRI of 95. Their LEP lamp is able to operate up to fifty percent more efficiently than conventional HID (high-intensity discharge lamp) lamps while generating the same maintained lumens as a conventional four hundred watt system at about half the energy. The technology also allows the lamp to be dimmed to fifty percent of the rated lamp lumen output.

     Recreational Facilities. Public, municipal or private facilities designed and equipped for the conduct of sports, leisure time activities, and other customary and usual recreational activities. Outdoor recreational facilities include, but are not limited to, fields or stadiums for softball, baseball, football, soccer, golf courses, driving ranges and other “field sports,” and courts for tennis, basketball, volleyball, handball and other “court sports.”

     Reflector. Controlling light output by means of reflection (mirror).

Chapter 25.02 INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS
25.02.010 Title and Purpose
A.      Title. This title shall be known as the Zoning Ordinance of the City.

B.      Relation to the General Plan. The City Council has instituted a comprehensive planning program in order to ensure that the anticipated growth within the City is organized, planned, and coordinated in a manner that will not place undue burdens on the City in its ability to provide urban services and facilities. This planning program has culminated in the preparation and adoption of a comprehensive General Plan.

C.      Role of Zoning Ordinance. Chapter 12 “Work Plan” of the General Plan recommends implementation strategies to accomplish the goals and objectives found within that document. In order to accomplish said goals and objectives the orderly development of the City, and the elimination of haphazard land development, is required. Among the methods noted is a regulatory Zoning Ordinance to govern the uses of land and the density and intensity of development.

D.      Purpose of Zoning Ordinance. The zoning regulations of the City are adopted to protect, promote, and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare, ensuring that development within the City is related to the City’s ability to provide essential urban services and is consistent with the Palm Desert General Plan. More specifically, these regulations are adopted to achieve the guiding principals identified in the General Plan and include the following objectives:

1.       Relate proposals for development to the provisions and recommendations of the City’s General Plan and ensure development is consistent with the guiding principals of the General Plan. To meet the guiding principals development proposals will be reviewed for their focus on: human-scale design, liveliness of centers, complete streets, accessibility and connectivity, and quality of open spaces.

2.       Foster a harmonious, convenient, workable and connected relationship among land uses.

3.       Ensure that public and private lands ultimately are used for the purposes which are most appropriate and most beneficial to the City as a whole.

4.       Provide population densities that support and encourage pedestrian activities such as walking and bicycling; that are connected to, and in proximity of, civic and education uses, open spaces, and commercial and employment opportunities.

5.       Foster an environment that ensures pedestrian amenities connect the community, are designed to accommodate pedestrians and bicyclist, and that are conveniently located for the highest impact.

6.       Forecast and plan for the City’s ability to provide community facilities, utilities, and services.

7.       Ensure adequate consideration for urban design in the development process so that new development enhances the City as it matures.

8.       Provide provisions for adequate bicycle parking, off-street parking, shared parking facilities, and off-street truck loading facilities.

9.       Promote preservation of natural environmental features in the development and use of land within the City.

10.     Develop land use regulations that will encourage infill development and redevelopment of existing sections of the City and provide for innovative development in undeveloped areas. (Ord. 1324 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

25.02.030 Scope, Interpretation, and Application
A.      Scope of Regulations. This title is adopted to implement the stated vision and objectives of the General Plan of the City. To accomplish these objectives the City shall regulate the use, location, area, and dimension of sites for development: the massing and height of structures, the architectural quality and appearance of buildings, uses, structures, connectivity, signs, open space, landscaping, access and egress, off-street parking, and other such aspects of land use which may be deemed necessary for the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare of the people working and living within the City.

B.      Authority for Regulations. The authority for the regulations contained within this title is based on Section 7, Article XI of the California Constitution; the provisions of the California Planning and Zoning Law which provide for the regulation of the intensity of land uses, and the adoption of standards for the regulation of population density; and the police power granted to municipalities by the laws of the State.

C.      Applicability and Conformity. The provisions of this title are not intended to revoke any easements, codes, covenants, and restrictions or other existing agreements which are more restrictive than the provisions of this title. Unless otherwise specified, existing development is not required to comply with new regulations. Any use or development made nonconforming by new regulations is subject to the requirements of Chapter 25.62 (Nonconforming Provisions).

D.      Relation to Less Restrictive Regulations. Whenever the provisions of this title impose more restrictive regulations upon buildings or structures and the use of them or the use of lands or premises and require larger open spaces or yards or setbacks than are imposed by other ordinances, the provisions of this title or the rules or regulations included within this title shall govern.

E.       Effective in Incorporated City. The provisions of this title are declared to be in effect upon all land within the incorporated jurisdiction of the City as exists or is hereafter changed by annexation.

F.       Relationship to Prior Ordinances. Any building for which a building permit has been issued and is valid under the provisions of earlier ordinances of the City which are in conflict with this title may be continued and completed in accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the permit was issued.

G.      Continuity. Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or any other provisions of this title, no new or additional variance, conditional use permit, or license shall be required for any land use heretofore authorized by the City or the County by a variance, conditional use permit, building permit, license, or tentative or final tract map, provided there has been substantial reliance upon the governmental entitlement mentioned in this chapter and, provided further, that conditions thereof are complied with and that substantial construction has begun on a portion of the project.

H.      Procedure Regarding Pending Action. The repeal or substitution of any ordinance shall not affect any prosecution which may be pending in any court for the violation of any provision of the ordinance at time of the repeal or substitution.

I.        Violation of Previous Ordinances. The substitution or repeal of any ordinance is not deemed to ratify or legalize any violation of any provision of such ordinance nor to affect the prosecution or punishment of any person, firm, or corporation for any act done or committed in violation of any provision of the ordinance prior to the taking effect of this title.

J.       Conviction of Crimes Continued. Any ordinance to be repealed or substituted by this title is deemed to continue and be in full force and effect for the purpose of prosecuting and meeting punishment for any violation presently pending in any court. (Ord. 1324 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

Chapter 25.04 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
25.04.010 Purpose
This chapter establishes the framework for zoning districts within the city and their relationship to the City’s General Plan land use categories. This chapter also establishes the zoning map as the official designation of zoning district boundaries. (Ord. 1324 § 3, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.04.020 Zoning Districts
The City is divided into zoning districts that are generally grouped into six categories: (A) residential districts, (B) commercial districts, (C) industrial districts, (D) downtown districts, (E) special districts, and (F) overlay districts. These districts implement the City’s General Plan land use categories as described in Table 25.04-1 (Zoning Districts). Each zone is further defined and regulated in the subsequent sections of this chapter.

A.      Residential Districts. Residential districts provide appropriately located areas for residential living at a range of population densities consistent with the General Plan. Development standards are in place to provide residential areas with sound standards of public health and safety, and provide space for semipublic facilities needed to complement urban residential areas, and for institutions that require a residential environment.

B.      Commercial Districts. Commercial districts provide appropriately located areas for retail stores, offices, service establishments, amusement establishments, and businesses, offering commodities and services required by residents and visitors of the City and the surrounding market area. Development standards for specific land uses are in place to ensure that these areas function appropriately and are compatible with surrounding land uses.

C.      Industrial Districts. The industrial districts allow for the manufacture, distribution, and service of products intended primarily for local use within Palm Desert, its sphere of influence, and surrounding communities. Land uses permitted in industrial districts also include research and development facilities and high-caliber technological centers. Development standards are included to ensure that industrial uses do not conflict with the overall character of a community and are compatible with surrounding uses.

D.      Special Districts. Special districts allow for the protection of open space and the establishment or expansion of public facilities or change in the use of lands owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by governmental agencies. Certain special districts also allow for the establishment of quasi-public institutional uses, and the reservation of areas for parks, public or private recreation, open space, and related governmental public uses.

E.       Downtown Districts. The downtown district is intended for the development of high intensity multi-story (3-5 stories) mixed-use development centered around the intersection of San Pablo Avenue and Highway 111, inclusive of El Paseo, and expanding east to west from Deep Canyon Road to Monterey Avenue. Development standards are included to allow building types that facilitate the creation of a sense of place, provide for high levels of pedestrian connections and interaction, and emphasize small block sizes and building form.

F.       Overlay Districts. The purpose of the overlay districts is to allow the City to adequately provide for special environmental constraints and to provide additional flexibility of development standards for desired development within the City. Furthermore, overlay districts are utilized:

1.       To allow more flexibility from the standard provisions of the underlying base zone.

2.       When special provisions are needed to protect unique site features or implement location-specific provisions.

3.       To specify a particular standard or guideline for an area.

In the event of a conflict between an overlay district and any base zoning district (residential, commercial, industrial, or special district) the provisions of the overlay district apply.

25.04.030 Zoning Map
The City of Palm Desert Zoning Map (hereafter referred to as the Zoning Map) is the official designation of zoning district boundaries on real property within the City. The Zoning Map shall be regulated as set forth below.

A.      Incorporated by Reference. The Zoning Map is hereby incorporated into this zoning code by reference as though it were fully included and as adopted by the City Council.

B.      Map Amendments. Amendments to the Zoning Map shall follow the process established in Section 25.78.040 (Amendments – Zoning Map).

C.      Relationship to General Plan and other Plans. The Zoning Map shall implement and shall be consistent with the City’s adopted General Plan. The Zoning Map shall be specifically consistent with the General Plan land use plan and any adopted specific plans.

D.      Zoning District Symbol. Zoning districts shall be illustrated on the Zoning Map as follows:

1.       Each residential, commercial, industrial, downtown, or special zoning district shall be described on the Zoning Map by use of its identified zoning district symbol, as listed in Table 25.04-1 (Zoning Districts).

2.       Overlay districts shall be designated by their representative symbol along with any related residential, commercial, industrial, downtown, or special base zoning district in a format determined by the ZA.

E.       Zoning Map Interpretation. If there is uncertainty about the location of any zoning district boundary shown on the Zoning Map, the precise location of the boundary shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator as follows:

1.       The boundaries of a zoning district shall be the centerlines of either streets or alleys, or lot lines of real property, unless otherwise shown. Where a district’s boundaries approximately follow centerlines or lot lines, those lines shall be interpreted as the district boundaries.

2.       If a district boundary divides a parcel and the boundary line location is not specified by distances printed on the Zoning Map, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the ZA. Each portion of the property shall be developed to the standards and allowed use provisions of the applied zoning district and any applied overlay or special zone(s).

3.       Where the street layout on the ground or the lot lines differ from such layout or lines shown on the zoning map, the ZA shall determine the exact boundary and the map shall be amended to conform to the layout on the ground.

4.       Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the property that was formerly in the street or alley shall be included within the zoning district of the adjoining property on either side of the centerline of the vacated or abandoned street or alley. (Ord. 1324 § 3, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

25.10.010 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish residential zoning districts in the City, along with allowed use and development standards applicable to those districts. These districts are consistent with and implement the City’s General Plan neighborhood land use categories as indicated in Table 25.04-1 (Zoning Districts). (Ord. 1324 § 4, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.10.020 Characteristics of the Residential Districts
The following descriptions of each residential district identify the characteristic uses, density, intensity of uses and the types of development intended for that district.

A.      Estate Residential District (RE). The district is intended to provide low intensity and neighborhood development (0.5—1.0 du/ac) and generally is characterized by limited development on large properties and preservation of natural features and open space.

B.      Single-Family/Mobile Home Residential District (R-1M). This district provides for the permanent placement and occupancy of single family dwelling units, factory built or manfucatored dwelling units and mobile homes for residential purposes on purchased, rented or leased lots. The district is characterized as having moderated density (4.0—7.0 du/ac) focused around community space and amenities with walkable streetscapes.

C.      Single-Family Residential District (R-1). The intent of this district is to encourage the preservation and development of traditional residential neighborhoods. The district provides for low intensity development (2.0—8.0 du/ac) generally characterized by single-family homes on medium-sized lots organized around formal and walkable streetscapes.

D.      Mixed Residential District (R-2). The intent of this district is to provide moderate intensity and density (3.0—10.0 du/ac) for neighborhood development. Neighborhoods are characterized by a variety of housing choices and mixed-uses. Buildings are organized around formal and walkable streetscapes with high levels of pedestrian connectivity.

E.       Multifamily Residential District (R-3). The intent of this district is to provide suitable areas for moderate to higher intensity and density (7.0—40.0 du/ac) for residential development and small scale commercial activity. The zoning district is characterized by higher density residential development and mixed-uses in proximity to retail and commercial services. Buildings are organized around formal streetscapes with a variety of plazas and other pedestrian amenites and open spaces that are highly connected to surrounding development.

F.       Hillside Planned Residential District (HPR). The purpose of the hillside planned residential district is to provide for the lowest intensity (0.2 du/ac) of residential development by minimizing the grading of hillside areas and to preserve the natural contours of the land by avoiding extensive cut and fill of slopes that result in a padding or staircase effect within the development. This district is characterized by the preservation of natural features and protected viewsheds, architecture and landscape design that blends with the natural terrain, and informal and natural streetscapes that follow the topography of the land.

G.      Planned Residential District (PR). The purpose of this district is to provide for flexibility in residential development, by encouraging creative and imaginative design, and the development of parcels of land as coordinated projects involving a mixture of residential densities (4.0—40.0 du/ac), mixed housing types, and community facilities. The district is charactersized as providing for the optimum integration of urban and natural amenities within developments and is organized around formal, walkable, and highly connected streetscapes. (Ord. 1324 § 4, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

(See Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations.)

10.     Smoking Restricted. Consistent with Section 1596.795 of the Health and Safety Code, smoking of tobacco and other substances—whether in pipe, cigar, or cigarette form—shall not be allowed in the applicant’s home during its hours of operation as a large family day care home with respect to those areas of the home where children are present.

11.     Proof of Control. No use permit shall be issued unless the applicant can demonstrate legal authority and control over the real property proposed to be used as a large family day care home.

K.      Government Office Building. Small neighborhood government office buildings are permitted up to 5,000 square feet in size.

L.       Office Parking Lot. Parking lots that serve office developments are permitted when located directly adjacent to the office professional zone and consistent with recommendations of the General Plan.

M.     Professional Office within Residential District. These uses are permitted with the issuance of a conditional use permit, provided property to be developed is abutting or across the street, or across an alley from commercially zoned property. Residential development standards are to be used to ensure compatibility. (Ord. 1324 § 4, 2017; Ord. 1279 § 2, 2015; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.10.050 Development Standards
The development standards on Table 25.10-3 (Residential Zoning District Development Standards) are applicable to the residential zoning districts. These standards, along with other development standards (e.g., landscaping requirements, signs, and parking standards) in this title, are intended to assist property owners and project designers in understanding the City’s minimum requirements and expectations for high-quality development.

A.      Hillside Planned Residential Development Standards. The following standards must be met prior to the approval of a hillside development plan as described in Section 25.78.020:

1.       Density. Each lot shall be limited to a maximum of one unit per 5 acres. All lots will be entitled to at least one unit.

2.       Grading. Location of building pads and access roads shall be evaluated, approved, or adjusted based on consistency with the following:

a.       Preserved natural contours of the land to avoid extensive cut and fill slopes to reduce the need for a staircase effect within developments.

b.       Architecture and landscape design which blends with the natural terrain to the greatest practical extent.

c.       Retention and protection of undisturbed viewsheds, natural landmarks, and features including vistas and the natural skyline as integral elements.

d.       Building Pad Area. The maximum area permanently disturbed by grading shall not exceed 10,000 square feet.

e.       Access Road or Driveway. Maximum permanent grading disturbance of natural terrain for development of access to the approved building pad shall be 3,000 square feet. Roads shall be located and designed to blend with the natural terrain to the greatest practical extent consistent with the grading provisions listed in this subsection A.2.

f.        Renaturalization. All cuts, fills, or other areas temporarily disturbed by grading shall be re-naturalized, colored, and landscaped to blend with the adjacent undisturbed natural terrain to the satisfaction of the City Council.

3.       Maximum Dwelling Unit Size. Total dwelling unit, garage and accessory building size on any one lot shall not exceed 4,000 square feet.

4.       Exception. The standards of subsections A.1 through A.3 of this section shall be required unless modified by one of the following:

a.       Precise Plan. The Commission and Council may approve a precise plan of design through public hearing process that modifies the standards in subsection A.1 through A.3. Said precise plan shall take into consideration any and all circumstances, including, but not limited to, viewshed, topography, color, texture, and profile of any structure that the Commission or Council may determine to be in conformity with the purposes set forth in this section.

b.       Previously Approved Existing Building Pads. If a property owner can demonstrate that a previous building pad was approved by the City or County before incorporation, a home and accessory structure(s) may be built on a previously approved building pad without a public hearing. The building size shall be limited to 35 percent of the lot, which may be increased up to 50 percent with ARC approval. Enlarging a previously approved existing building pad shall require a new public hearing subject to the provisions of this chapter.

5.       Previously approved existing building pads shall be subject to the standard coverage limitations of 35 percent, which may be increased up to 50 percent with ARC approval. Any change to an existing approved building pad shall require a new public hearing subject to the provisions of this chapter.

6.       Development on or across ridges is prohibited.

7.       Building pads and architecture shall be designed to eliminate or minimize any visual impact on the City to the maximum extent feasible.

8.       All common open space shall be preserved for that purpose as shown in the development plan. The developer shall choose one or a combination of the following 3 methods of administering common open space:

a.       Dedication of common open space to the City, which is subject to formal acceptance.

b.       Establishment of an association or nonprofit corporation of all property owners or corporations within the project area to ensure perpetual maintenance of all common open space.

c.       Retention of ownership, control, and maintenance of all common open space by the developer; all privately owned common open space shall continue as such and shall only be used in accordance with the development plan; appropriate land use restrictions shall be contained in all deeds to ensure that the common open space is permanently preserved according to the development plan; said deed restrictions shall run with the land and be for the benefit of present as well as future property owners, and shall contain a prohibition against partition of common open space.

9.       Design Criteria. The following design criteria are established:

a.       The overall plan shall achieve an integrated land and building relationship.

b.       Open spaces, pedestrian and vehicular circulation facilities, parking facilities, and other pertinent amenities shall be an integral part of the landscape and particular attention shall be given to the retention of natural landscape features of the site.

c.       The layout of structures and other facilities shall effect a conservation in street and utility improvements.

d.       Recreational areas, active and passive, shall be generally dispersed throughout the development and shall be easily accessible from all dwelling units.

e.       Architectural unity and harmony within the development and with the surrounding properties shall be attained.

B.      Planned Residential District Standards.

1.       Purpose. It is the purpose of the PR district to provide for flexibility in development, creative and imaginative design, and the development of parcels of land as coordinated projects involving a mixture of residential densities and housing types, and community facilities. The PR district is further intended to provide for the optimum integration of urban and natural amenities within developments. The PR district is also established to give a land developer assurance that innovative and unique land development techniques will be given reasonable consideration for approval and to provide the City with assurances that the completed project will contain the character envisioned at the time of approval.

2.       Filing Procedure. To initiate the review process, the applicant shall file applications for a change of zone (if needed) to a PR district along with a precise plan, tentative tract/parcel map and supporting environmental documentation.

3.       Maximum Project Densities. The maximum project density shall be as expressed in dwelling units per gross acre of not more than the number following the zoning symbol PR. The Council shall determine the densities to be allowed within each PR district at the time the involved properties are rezoned and as designated on the zoning map within the following range: one to 40 dwelling units maximum per average gross acre. The density designation shall mean dwelling units per average gross acre. For example, PR-7 means a planned residential development with seven units per gross acre.

4.       Maximum Density for “Affordable Projects.” For projects containing at least 20 percent units affordable to low income households as defined by the Riverside County Housing Authority, a maximum density of 55 dwelling units per acre may be allowed by precise plan. To be eligible for this program, the developer must enter into a development agreement which will tie the zoning designation and the precise plan approval to affordable housing performance standards.

5.       Development Standards Applicable. All areas within the project site shall be subject to the following:

a.       The standards for development of PR districts set forth in this chapter and any supplemental standards for the planned community designated in the precise plan.

b.       Off-street parking and loading requirements. All parking and loading shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 25.46.

c.       Utilities. For provisions regarding utilities, see Section 25.40.120.

d.       Signs. All signs shall be in compliance with Chapter 25.56.

e.       Outside Storage. No outside storage shall exceed the height of actual perimeter screening.

f.        Screening. All screening requirements for developments within the PR district shall be determined by the ARC during review of the precise plan.

g.       Trash Handling. Trash handling facilities shall be provided for all developments within the PR district with the exception of single-family detached dwellings. A trash enclosure will be provided for all but excepted uses, unless the proposed location of the trash area is completely enclosed by walls or buildings. The freestanding trash enclosure shall be constructed of masonry block. No trash shall be allowed to extend above or beyond the enclosure.

6.       Site Plan Review. Review of a site plan by Planning Department staff shall be required before a building permit is issued for any development in the PR district.

7.       Special Standards. In addition to requiring all development plans to comply with the following special standards the Council and/or Commission may impose such other conditions to the development plan as it deems necessary or desirable in carrying out the general purpose and intent of this chapter.

Notes

1.     The dimension requirements included in this column apply to a manufactured home park project sites as well as individual sites within the park. The first dimension is for the larger project site.

2.     Lot coverage may be increased to as much as 50 percent pending ARC approval, through the design review process.

3.     All development standards are based on the square footage shown on the zoning map and not necessarily the physical lot size of a property. Properties only zoned R-1 without a square footage allocation shall comply with standards for < 10,000 square feet. Confirm standards with Planning Division staff for correct zoning designation and lot size development standards.

4.     Hillside Development Plan approval process in Section 25.78.020

5.     The standards and guidelines presented in this section provide design criteria for the achievement of functional and attractive developments that fit within the context of the City of Palm Desert. Exceptions to the criteria contained within the Development Plan may be appropriate with the application of innovative and unique design techniques in keeping with the character envisioned at the time of approval.

6.     Setbacks within the Palm Desert Country Club in R-1 and R-2 have a 5 feet sideyard setback (See Figure 25.10-1 Palm Desert Country Club Setbacks) and a combined setback of 10 feet.

7.     Allowable maximum building height is 18 feet with approval by the Architectural Review Commission (ARC).

Chapter 25.16 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
25.16.010 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish commercial and industrial zoning districts in the City, along with allowed use and development standards applicable to those districts. These districts are consistent with and implement the City’s General Plan commercial and industrial district and center land use categories as indicated in Table 25.04-1 (Zoning Districts). (Ord. 1329 § 3, 2017; Ord. 1324 § 5, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.16.020 Characteristics of the Commercial and Industrial Districts
The following descriptions of each district identify the characteristic uses, intensity of uses, and intended level of development for that district.

A.      Office Professional (OP). This district is intended for various levels of intensities for business, office, administrative, research and development, and/or professional land uses. This district is characterized by urban streetscapes with formal tree arrangements and larger block sizes.

B.      Planned Commercial (PC). The PC districts provide flexibility for commercial and mixed-use development. Generally, these districts are characterized as coordinated projects that integrate compatible commercial and residential mixed-uses. PC districts balance the need for automobile parking and pedestrian connections that are organized around walkable streetscapes and other pedestrian amenities. PC districts are further refined based on property size, proximity to residential uses, and as described below:

1.       Specialty Commercial Center (PC-1). The specialty commercial center provides for small-scale commercial development that primarily serves surrounding neighborhoods and other immediate land uses. This district is characterized as being located in close proximity to residential development and, as such, provides high levels of convenient pedestrian access. This district also promotes the development of mixed-use (10.0 – 15.0 du/ac) as a transition between residential uses and other development types.

2.       District Commercial Center (PC-2). The district commercial center provides convenient shopping opportunities outside of the downtown core area. This PC district provides large-format retail areas for the broader community and provides flexibility for the integration of mixed-use (10.0 – 15.0 du/ac) on upper floors of commercial buildings. The center is also characterized by traditional parking lots with formal tree arrangements and spacing and sufficient space for pedestrian areas and open space.

3.       Regional Commercial Center (PC-3). The regional commercial center provides a unified area for commercial uses which offer a wide range of goods and services, including comparison and convenience shopping, entertainment, cultural, and recreational uses. The district provides for large-scale, large-format, commercial development that serves the broader region and is generally located around major intersections and properties in proximity to freeway overpasses. Although this district is predominately commercial, mixed-use (10.0 – 15.0 du/ac) is allowed and should be integrated into developments on the upper floor.

4.       Resort Commercial Center (PC-4). The resort commercial center allows for the development of a range of entertainment, hospitality, restaurants, and recreational facilities with related commercial uses to serve visitors to the City. The district is characterized by multi-story development that provides recreation and entertainment amenities in accordance with its urban/natural setting, and provides flexibility to integrate mixed-use (10.0 du/ac).

C.      Service Industrial (SI). This district allows for the development of traditional business parks that allow for manufacture, distribution, research and development, and service of products intended for use within Palm Desert and surrounding communities. The district is characterized as having a more urban setting with buildings located near roadways, shared and connected parking, and streetscapes with formal street tree arrangements. (Ord. 1329 § 3, 2017; Ord. 1324 § 5, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.16.030 Allowed Land Uses and Permit Requirements
Table 25.16-1 (Use Matrix for Commercial and Industrial Districts) identifies allowed uses and corresponding permit requirements for commercial and industrial districts and all other provisions of this title. Descriptions/definitions of the land uses can be found in Chapter 25.99 (Definitions). The “Special Use Provisions” column in the table identifies the specific chapter or section where additional regulations for the specific use type are located within this title.

Use regulations in the table are shown with representative symbols by use classification listing: “P” symbolizes uses permitted by right, “A” symbolizes uses that require approval of an administrative use permit, “C” symbolizes uses that require approval of a conditional use permit, and “N” symbolizes uses that are not permitted. Uses that are not listed are not permitted. However, the Commission may make a use determination as outlined in Section 25.72.020 (Use Determinations).

Chapter 25.18 DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS*
* CodeAlert: This topic has been affected by Ordinance No. 1358. To view amendments and newly added provisions, please refer to the CodeAlert Amendment List.


25.18.010 Purpose and Applicability
A.      Purpose. This chapter provides detailed regulations for development and new land uses within the 111 Corridor Plan area and is intended to provide for the continuing evolution of the 111 Corridor Plan area from an old highway commercial strip to a place where:

1.       A mixture of land uses including shops, workplaces, residences, and civic buildings are within walking distance of one another;

2.       Streets that are attractive to pedestrians also conveniently and efficiently accommodate the needs of cyclists and the automobile; and

3.       New and remodeled buildings work together to define the pedestrian-oriented space of the public streets within the plan area, and are harmonious with each other and the desired character of the plan area.

B.      Applicability. Proposed development, subdivisions, and new land uses within the plan area shall comply with all applicable requirements of this Development Code, as follows.

1.       Regulating Plan. The Regulating Plan (Figure 25.18-1) defines the zones within the 111 Corridor Plan area that differentiate standards for building placement, design, and use; and identifies the parcels included within each zone.

2.       Land Use and Permit Requirements. Section 25.18.040 identifies the land use types allowed by the City in each of the zones established by the Regulating Plan. A parcel within the 111 Corridor Plan area shall be occupied only by land uses identified as allowed within the applicable zone by Section 25.18.040, subject to the type of City approval (for instance permitted by right, administrative use permit, conditional use permit) required by Section 25.18.040.

3.       Development Standards. The development standards in Section 25.18.050 regulate the building envelope and the features of buildings that affect the public realm of the street, sidewalk, and public open spaces. The development standards regulate building intensity, building setbacks, building height, building size and spacing, required frontage types, allowed architectural elements, required on-site open space, parking placement, and parking requirements and vary according to the zone applied to a parcel by the Regulating Plan. Proposed development shall comply with all applicable standards in Section 25.18.050. (Ord. 1313, 2016)

25.18.030 Characteristics of Downtown Districts
The following descriptions of each downtown district identify the characteristic uses, intensity of uses, and level of development intended for that district.

 

A. Downtown (D) District. The Downtown (D) zone introduces urban, multi-story buildings up to 3 stories tall and located at or near the sidewalk.* Primary building access is from the sidewalk and parking is behind buildings or subterranean. Ground floors accommodate retail, restaurant, service, and office uses, while upper floors accommodate residential and office uses. Residential uses are prohibited on the ground floor along the El Paseo frontage.



B. Downtown Core Overlay (D-O). Buildings within the Downtown Core Overlay (D-O) may be up to 4 stories.* In addition, residential uses are prohibited on the ground floor.



C. Downtown Edge (DE) District. The Downtown Edge (DE) zone serves as a buffer between downtown and the residential neighborhoods to the north and south. It introduces urban, multi-story buildings up to 3 stories tall. It is a flexible zone that allows a wide range of uses, including residential, office, service, and retail uses. Buildings with retail ground floors are located right behind the sidewalk while buildings with residential ground floors are set back with small front yards.



D. Downtown Edge Transition Overlay (DE-O). Buildings within the Downtown Edge Transition Overlay (DE-O) are required to step down to 2 stories along the portions of the parcel that are adjacent to single-family zones. In addition, most nonresidential uses within the DE-O are permitted subject to a conditional use permit.



*      Building height may be increased by 1 story if public improvements are implemented per conditions in 111 Corridor Implementation Manual.

1       The distance between the face of curb and primary street and side street building facades must be consistent with the sidewalk and landscape width requirements of General Plan Chapter 10, Streetscape and Public Realm. Accordingly, buildings along the primary street and side street may need to be set back farther than the minimum specified setback in order to provide space for the sidewalk and landscape widths envisioned by the General Plan.

2       Building heights are the vertical distance from the average elevation of the finished grade to the top of eve or top of parapet; pitched roof height is the additional vertical distance from the top of eave to the highest point of the roof; ground story height is measured floor to floor.

3       Building height may be increased by 1 story / an additional 15 ft. if public improvements are implemented per conditions in 111 Corridor Implementation Manual.

4       Only allowed on upper floors.

5       Includes eaves extending into setback from a covered stoop, bay window, cantilevered room, or covered balcony.

6       Open space type may count towards minimum required open space requirement as defined in Section G.1 of Table 25.18-2.

7       Partially subterranean and fully subterranean parking garages may align with the primary street and/or side street building frontage line(s) provided they do not extend higher than the maximum ground floor height standards described in Table 25.18-2, Section C.4.

(Ord. 1313, 2016)

 

25.18.060 Illustrated Glossary
 

Building Height. Vertical distance from the average elevation of the finished grade to the top of eve or top of parapet; pitched roof height is the additional vertical distance from the top of eave to the highest point of the roof. See Figure 25.18-2 (Building Height).



Building Setback. The distance between the building line and the property line, or when abutting a street, the ultimate right-of-way line. See Figure 25.18-3 (Building Setbacks).



Primary Street. The street that is typically higher in the street hierarchy, typically carries more traffic, and where the main facade of a building typically faces.



Required Open Space. Required open space shall be provided in area shown in Figure 25.18-4 (Required Open Space).

Chapter 25.20 DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS DESIGN GUIDELINES
25.20.010 Purpose and Applicability.
The design guidelines in this section provide direction for the design of buildings, appurtenances and site elements. The materials, methods, and forms herein are recommended. Alternative forms may be permitted when approved in writing by the Director, based on a finding that they conform to the design intent of this Code or are otherwise required by law. (Ord. 1313, 2016)

 

25.20.020 Building Articulation Guidelines
 

A. Purpose

 

This section defines recommended building articulation strategies and techniques to help ensure that new development is compatible with and contributes to the intended urban scale and character of each zone.

 

These design strategies and techniques enable the designer to manipulate the “scale” of buildings in addition to manipulating their size. Maximum building size standards are provided in the urban standards for each zone. Additional building scale guidelines are provided in the urban design criteria for that zone, and this section provides additional guidance for meeting the intent of those design criteria.

 

These techniques are intended to help enable the design of buildings or building masses that may be larger in total width or height than neighboring buildings, or the intended “neighborhood scale,” by reducing the apparent mass and scale of the subject building through design.

 

These building articulation techniques need not be applied to buildings or building masses that are by their basic size and massing already consistent with the intended architectural scale for the applicable zone or urban context. Over-articulation of buildings can produce a cluttered and busy appearance that can be just as inappropriate as buildings with too little articulation.

 

These strategies are applied to the following fundamental building mass types, as described in the following pages:

 

1. Block form

2. House form

 

The success of the articulation proposed for any building will be reviewed by the Architectural Review Commission, taking into consideration the totality of the proposed development in relation to its immediate context and the intent of the applicable zone.



The massing of this mixed-use building is broken up by projecting corner balconies and chimney volumes that extend from the second floor residential units below.



The mass of this multi-family building is broken up with a gable that extends above the roof line and marks the entry into the unit.

 



Building masses, entrance porticos, chimneys, and corner windows project from the main mass of this multi-family building.

B. Block-Form Massing

 

A block-form building is 1 to 5 stories tall, attached to or attachable to buildings on neighboring properties with no intervening side yard or setback. Such buildings—built at or near the street right-of-way line—form a portion of a “perimeter block,” the edges of which strongly define the urban space of the adjoining streets.

 

Block-form buildings typically, but not invariably, have flat roofs, with or without pitched roof design elements at the top of the street facade. Such buildings generally extend the full width of the lot, and on wide lots have the potential to become significantly out of scale with their historic and existing urban context. A series of basic building articulation techniques are illustrated at right, by which the scale of block form-buildings may be moderated to contribute to the intended character of the applicable zone.

Q:\palm-desert.ca\Palm Desert 111 Corridor Form-Based Code\161011_111_Code_DRAFT_rev_170117-web-resources\image\MA_Block_Form_11.jpg

To modulate the apparent size and scale of a building by stepping a portion of the street-facing facade forward or backward from the predominant facade plane of the building.

 

Note that in city center or neighborhood center settings, this technique of stepping the facade backward or forward is generally less effective than stepping the facade up or down (see Vertical Articulation on following page). A steady building line at the ground floor is often desirable in defining a walkable downtown street.

EXAMPLES:



This mixed-use building on Main Street is set back from the buildings on either side of it.

 



A multi-story mixed-use building set backs portions of its facade.

 



The orange mass of this mixed-use building is set back from the rest of the building. Further articulation is provided by second- and third-story balconies.

Q:\palm-desert.ca\Palm Desert 111 Corridor Form-Based Code\161011_111_Code_DRAFT_rev_170117-web-resources\image\MA_Block_Form_21.jpg

To modulate the apparent size and scale of a building by stepping a portion of the street-facing facade upward or downward from the predominant building height.

 

 

 

Note that this technique offers the opportunity to organize a rather long building into multiple “apparent buildings” to avoid the appearance of a “block-long building.” This technique is also useful for “stepping down” the scale of a new building adjacent to an existing smaller building.

EXAMPLES:



These buildings along Main Street are built at different heights, adding variety to what would otherwise be a continuous wall.



A combination of a prominent corner tower and building masses with parapets and pitched roofs reduced the apparent size of this building.

 



A multi-family building where the massing is broken down into smaller volumes.

To modulate the apparent size and scale of a building by the application of projected architectural elements from the plane of the facade.

 

Note that this technique may be applied alone or in conjunction with other recommended articulation techniques. This technique is best suited to small-scale adjustments of building scale, whereas the building massing techniques on the previous pages are better suited to larger scale compatibility adjustments.

EXAMPLES:



A mixed-use building with inset windows and decorative balconies.



Upper floor balconies project from the corner of this mixed-use building.

 



Three-story bay windows and balconies project from the facade of this mixed-use building.

 

4. ARCHITECTURAL RECESSIONS

 

INTENT AND TECHNIQUE

 

To modulate the apparent size and scale of a building by the application of recessed architectural elements or spaces – such as a recessed porch, covered passage, or recessed balcony – is cut into the plane of the facade.

 

Note that this technique has the potential to strongly define building entries, to provide transitional spaces at those entries, and in some cases to provide a lighter more open scale and character to building facades.

EXAMPLES:



A third-story covered balcony, along with second floor French balconies help articulate this 3-story mixed-use building.



A recessed storefront accommodates covered, outdoor seating.

 



The front facade of this 2-story townhouse building is recessed to accommodate the front entries.

(Ord. 1313, 2016)

 

25.20.030 Frontage Type Guidelines
A.      Purpose. Frontages are critical to defining district character, both in appearance and function. Frontages are comprised of the street facade of the building(s), including any projecting elements, and the landscape, hardscape, walls and fences of the front yard. Frontages provide an appropriate transition from the public environment of the street to the semi-private and private environments of front yards and street-facing ground floor spaces. They also signal the location of the building entrance and provide a semi-public space within which neighbors and visitors can interact. Frontages can also help to screen any on-site parking areas.

B.      Applicability. The primary frontage of each building that faces a primary street or a park or other public space should be designed in conformance with the guidelines of this section.

C.      Allowable frontage types. All new buildings, renovations that comprise 50% of the existing structure, and additions that face the street should be designed to incorporate at least one of the frontage types allowed in that zone.

D.      Requirements for all building frontages. All buildings should provide at least 1 street-facing primary pedestrian entry and street-facing windows on all floors. The frontage types herein may modify the configuration of those doors and windows but not replace them. (Ord. 1313, 2016)

 

25.20.031 Shopfront
A.      Description. Shopfronts are large openings in the facade at or near the sidewalk, enclosed with doors and transparent glass in a storefront assembly. The primary shop entrance is at the grade of the sidewalk and provides direct access to the commercial/retail use(s) on the ground floor. The basic required architectural elements comprising the storefront are large windows, doors with glass, transom windows, and a solid base (bulkhead). Optional elements include awnings, cantilevered shed roof or canopy, signage, lighting, and cornices.

Awnings or canopies may encroach into the public right-of-way over the sidewalk, extending to a distance within 2 feet of the face of curb. Primary street and side street setbacks, if any, are to be paved with a paving material that is consistent with or matches the adjacent sidewalk.

B.      Design standards.

1.       Storefront assemblies (doors, display windows, bulkheads, and associated framing) should not be set back within the shopfront openings more than 2 ft.

2.       Doors should match the materials, design, and character of the display window framing. “Narrowline” aluminum doors are prohibited.

3.       Display windows:

a.       Storefront(s) opening(s) along the primary frontage should comprise at least 70% of the ground floor wall area.

b.       Walls without openings should not exceed 10 linear feet along primary street frontages and 25 linear feet along side street frontages.

4.       Storefront glass that is clear, lightly tinted (e.g., less than 15%, low emissivity, solar) without reflective coating or dark tinting is encouraged. Instead, frontage types such as arcades and galleries and architectural elements such as awnings and canopies are encouraged to shade shopfront openings.

5.       Transom windows (horizontal glass panels immediately above the storefront) are encouraged. Glass in clerestory windows may be clear, stained glass, or frosted glass.

6.       Bulkheads:

a.       Storefront bulkheads should be of material similar or complementary to the main materials of the building and should be made of the same materials or materials that appear to be visually “heavier” than the adjacent walls.

b.       Recommended materials include ceramic tile, polished stone, or glass tile.

7.       Awning widths should correspond to storefront openings and shall not extend across the entire facade.

8.       New or renovated storefronts within historic buildings should consider emulating or recreating a previous storefront (from historic photos or drawings) in order to harmonize with the overall building architecture. This can be flexibly interpreted, for example, when the general form of a new storefront is like the original but the materials are contemporary.

25.20.032 Arcade
A.      Description. Arcades are facades with a ground floor colonnade that supports the upper stories of the building or, for 1-story buildings, the roof. Arcades contain ground-floor shopfronts, making them ideal for retail or restaurant use, as the arcade shelters the pedestrian while shading the storefront glass, preventing glare that might obscure views of merchandise.

Planter boxes or pots may be placed in between the columns to provide enclosure for such uses as cafe seating.

B.      Design Standards.

1.       Along primary frontages, the arcade column spacing should correspond to storefront openings.

2.       Column height should be 4 to 5 times the column width. Column spacing and colonnade detailing, including lighting, should be consistent with the style of the building to which it is attached.

3.       Along primary street, walls without openings should not exceed 10 linear feet.

25.20.033 Gallery
A.      Description. Galleries are facades with ground floor colonnades that support a cantilevered shed roof or a deck that covers the sidewalk. Galleries contain ground floor storefronts, making them ideal for retail use. Railing on top of the gallery is only required if the gallery roof is accessible as a deck.

Planter boxes or pots may be placed in between columns to provide enclosure for such uses as cafe seating, provided that adequate throughway access is maintained.

B.      Design standards.

1.       Galleries may be roofed, provided the materials, style and design are consistent with the building.

2.       Galleries should be combined with the shopfront type (Section 5.10.020).

3.       Galleries may encroach over the sidewalk in the public right-of-way, subject to the issuance of an encroachment permit or license agreement prior to issuance of a building permit.

4.       Column height should be four to five times the column width. Column spacing and colonnade detailing, including lighting, should be consistent with the style of the building to which it is attached.

5.       Columns should be placed in relation to curbs to allow passage around and for passengers of cars to disembark.

6.       Walls without openings along primary street should not exceed 10 linear feet in length.

A.      Description. A stair and landing leading directly from the sidewalk to a building entrance. The ground floor of the building is raised to provide privacy for the rooms facing the public street. This frontage type is ideal for ground floor housing that is near the street.

B.      Design standards.

1.       Stoops should correspond directly with the building entry(s) they provide access to.

2.       The exterior stairs may be perpendicular or parallel to the adjacent sidewalk.

3.       The landing may be covered or uncovered.

4.       Landscaping should be placed on the sides of the stoop, either at grade or in raised planters.

25.20.035 Door Yard
A.      Description. An elevated or at-grade garden or terrace that is located in the front yard setback and that is enclosed by a low wall located at or near the property line. For elevated door yards, access from the sidewalk to the door yard is via a stair or ramp.

The door yard can accommodate a variety of activities, ranging from dining patios for commercial uses to patios for residential uses. In addition, the interior building spaces are separated from the adjacent sidewalk by the depth of the door yard and in the case of raised door yards, by the terrace height.

B.      Design standards.

1.       Door yards are enclosed by low walls.

2.       The average grade of elevated door yards should not be more than 3 feet higher than the adjacent sidewalk or public open space. Walls may extend an additional 2 feet in height and fences or railings to the height required by the California Building Code (CBC).

3.       Wall and/or fence design, materials, and finishes should be consistent with the architectural style of the building.

25.20.040 Architectural Elements Guidelines
 

A. Purpose

 

This section identifies recommended architectural elements to ensure consistency with the plan’s goals for building form, character, and architectural quality. Some architectural elements are intended to project from the building face, encroaching into building setback areas or in some cases into the public right-of-way. Standards for such encroachments are provided in Table 25.18-2.F.

 

Architectural elements are intended to enliven building facades with human scale elements and spaces, providing them with depth, shade and shadow. These elements provide facade articulation at an intermediate scale, smaller than massing and larger than fenestration. They help to express the character and style of the building, purposefully and seamlessly integrated with the massing and fenestration, not just stuck on to “break up the mass.”



Building with second floor balconies.



This building employs a couple of architectural elements to help break up the massing, including second-floor cantilevered rooms and street-facing, second-floor balconies.



This contemporary building provides corner balconies to modulate the corner of the building and shade the shopfront below.



Example of a two-story bay window.

 

B. General Guidelines

 

The following general design guidelines apply to building facades and architectural elements.

1.       Architectural elements of each buildings—as well as its walls, roofs, windows, doors and other elements—should be consistent in design character, palette of materials, approach to detailing, and style.

2.       Simple, natural bulding materials that age gracefully over time are prefered. Examples include smooth plaster, stone, brick, tile, metal, wood and glass.

3.       When synthetic building materials are employed, they should faithfully simulate the natural material they are replacing, and possess superior weathering and aging characteristics.

4.       Attached and projecting architectural elements and details that provide buildings with a human scale and pedestrian orientation—including lighting fixtures, custom signage, awnings, hand rails, balconies, and trellises—should be designed to be consistent and compatible throughout the building.

5.       Awnings and canopies. Entry coverings may include canvas awnings, or projected shed or gabled roofs supported by brackets made of wood, wrought iron or metal. Awnings should be of a simple shed form, made of natural canvas or materials of similar appearance. Modern buildings may have metal or glass awnings supported by tension rods

6.       Balconies, bay windows and projected rooms of traditionally styled buildings should have visible supports in the form of projecting beams or braces. Balconies on modern styled bulidings may simply project.

7.       Railings. On traditional buildings, porch, balcony and other railings should be made of wood, wrought iron, steel bar or tube faithfully simulating true wrought iron. Modern buildings may also use galvanized or painted steel, aluminum, and cable railing components. Vinyl substitutes should be avoided.

8.       Bay windows should be a maximum of 8 feet in width and should have a height that is equal to or greater than their width. Bays should be placed a minimum of 3 feet from any building corner or other bay. A bay’s street facing facade should consist of at least 50% transparent fenestration.

 



A mixed-use building with second-floor bay windows.



A multi-family building with two-story bay windows. The roof of the bay window is a balcony for the third floor space.

(Ord. 1313, 2016)

 

 

25.20.050 On-Site Open Space Guidelines
A. Intent

 

On-site open space provides private and common public outdoor space for the enjoyment and use of residents and businesses, and also provides comfortable spaces through which pedestrian access is provided from the street to any buildings (or portions of buildings) that lack direct street frontage.

 

This section identifies a series of open space types, including the configuration, size, and design characteristics each type. Refer to the district that applies to your lot to see which of these may be applied toward meeting the required amounts of on-site open space, and the size and configuration criteria that apply. Defined open space types are:

 

1. Front Yard

2. Court

3. Back Yard

4. Side Yard

5. Roof Deck

6. Passage

 



A dooryard provides private open space for this

residential unit.

 



A shared court provides access to multiple units.

 



A court provides yard behind a rowhouse.



A covered passage leads to mixed-use court.

(Ord. 1313, 2016)

25.20.051 Front Yard
A.      Intent and description. The front yard is the area between the building façade and the street, providing pedestrian access from the street to all buildings and dwellings on the lot, as well as a physical separation from the street and a semi-public space for play and greeting one’s neighbors. Front yards may be visually continuous with adjacent yards with a common landscape, or enclosed by a low fence, wall, or hedge. On sloping sites, front yards may be raised above the level of the adjacent sidewalk and supported by a low retaining wall at the property line with steps providing access between the sidewalk and the yard (dooryard). Frontage types and architectural elements may encroach into front yards, as allowed by the zone.

B.      Configuration and size.

1.       The front yard is the area between the primary street facing building facade and the primary street property line, as shown in Figure 25.20-7.

2.       On corner lots, the front yard also includes the area between the side street facing facade and the side street property line up to the fence enclosing the back yard, as shown in Figure 25.20-7.

3.       Courts may extend into the primary street and/or side street setback area(s), but portions within these setbacks areas do not count towards the minimum required on-site open space requirements of each individual zone.

4.       Dooryards, porches, stoops, and architectural elements may encroach into the front yard as allowed by each individual zone.

C.      Design guidelines.

1.       Front yard landscape. Front yards should be landscaped and maintained as shown in Figure 25.20-7 and as follows:

a.       Except for walkways, front yards should be planted in their entirety with trees, shrubs, ground cover and water conserving plant materials.

b.       Front yard landscape should be maintained in an orderly and neat condition.

2.       Parkway planting. The parkway between the sidewalk and the street should be landscaped and maintained as shown in Figure 25.20-7 and as follows:

a.       Street trees of an approved type should be provided in the planting strip between the sidewalk and the street.

b.       Parkways should be planted with water conserving plant materials.

c.       Parkways at commercial uses may be omitted to allow for pedestrian access. Trees should be accommodated in tree wells.

3.       Front yard fences.

a.       Front yard fence and wall materials and design should be compatible with the architectural style of the building.

b.       Front yard fences, walls, and hedges shall be no taller than 3 feet 6 inches above the adjacent sidewalk or as defined in the urban standards for the applicable zone.

c.       On corner lots, fences and walls along the side street frontage may be up to 6 feet high for the rear portion of the site up to 15 feet behind the primary street facing facade line (see Figure 25.20-7). Fences along the remaining side street frontage may be up to a maximum of 3 feet 6 inches high or as defined in the urban standards for the applicable zone.

d.       Raised front yards (door yards) shall be up to a maximum of 3 feet 6 inches high above adjacent sidewalk or as defined in the urban standards for the applicable zone.

25.20.052 Court
A.      Intent and description. A court is a semi-public, shared open space within a lot, for use by more than one resident or tenant. It is a well-defined, coherent area that is an essential component of the project’s design, not merely space left over after the building mass is placed. Courts generally provide visitor access from the street to dwellings, retail or office spaces, and/or buildings within the lot that lack direct frontal access from the street. The degree of enclosure or openness may vary, as per the requirements of each zone and the design intent of the project designer.

B.      Configuration and size.

1.       Configuration. Courts—particularly the portion of the court(s) that is intended to meet the minimum required on-site open space area requirements of each individual zone—should be placed in the following ways:

a.       Side court. The court is placed along the side yard of the parcel to:

i.        Work together with a court or back yard on an adjacent lot to create the effect of one large open space;

ii.       Provide a contiguous space for entrances to a neighboring existing building that face the proposed project and are located close to the property line, to face; or

iii.     When the adjoining lot contains a single-family house, to create a large open space next to the house.

b.       Open to street. The court adjoins the minimum primary street setback line creating a deep, combined garden/terrace facing the street.

c.       Internal courtyard. The court is an internal courtyard, entirely contained within the site.

d.       Special circumstances. When a site contains an exceptional feature, such as a large, healthy tree or topography, the court is placed to retain and take advantage of that special feature.

2.       Size. Refer to the applicable zone for dimensional requirements.

3.       Enclosure.

a.       In general, a court’s perimeter should be defined by building walls on at least 2 sides, and on a third side by building walls or architectural or landscape elements such as low walls or trellises, or linear landscape elements such as hedges or rows of trees.

b.       In some cases, one side of a court may be defined by a building wall or a linear landscape element on an adjoining property.

c.       Driveways located adjacent to a court should be screened by architectural elements such as low walls or trellises, or linear landscape elements such as hedges or rows of trees so as not to appear to be located within the court.

4.       Encroachments into courts. Dooryards, stoops, and architectural elements may encroach into the court as allowed by the urban standards of each zone.

 

FIG. 25.20-8A. SIDE COURT EXAMPLES

FIG. 25.20-8B. OPEN TO STREET COURT EXAMPLES



 

C.      Design guidelines.

1.       Common area. Courts should be designed to be gathering places for the occupants and also circulation spaces through which pedestrian access is provided from the street to any buildings (or portions of buildings) that lack direct street frontage.

Chapter 25.28 OVERLAY DISTRICTS
25.28.010 Purpose
The overlay zoning districts established in this chapter are designed to supplement the use regulations and/or development standards of the applicable underlying base zoning district by recognizing distinctive areas of the City that have special and unique social, architectural, or environmental characteristics which require special considerations not otherwise adequately provided by the underlying base zone applicable to the property. (Ord. 1324 § 7, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.28.020 Senior Housing Overlay District
A.      Purpose and applicability. The purpose of the Senior Housing Overlay (SO) district is to provide optional standards and incentives for the development of a wide variety of specialized housing designed for and restricted to residents over the age of 55. Whenever the SO has been added to a base zone, the applicant may choose whether to use the optional SO standards or the standards of the base zone.

B.      Uses permitted by approved precise plan and conditional use permit. Uses permitted by approved precise plan and conditional use permit shall be residential retirement developments consisting of attached or detached units for rent or sale and associated recreational facilities and involving varying degrees of support arrangements, ranging from completely independent living, congregation, assisted, and memory care to community food service and healthcare.

C.      Development standards. Development standards shall be flexible to ensure efficient site planning and neighborhood compatibility and to reflect the unique requirements of persons over the age of 55.

D.      Density and intensity.

1.       Due to smaller unit and household sizes, project density (units per acre) shall be determined by intensity (persons per acre) and age.

2.       Overall project population shall be calculated according to the following factors:

Preservation of existing open space is paramount to any new development proposal and all proposals shall incorporate and preserve portions of the existing open space into the project design. At a minimum, all golf course conversion projects shall retain or provide 45 percent open space, unless the applicant can demonstrate support for a reduction in the open space from the impacted golf-course community.

2.       Community Amenities/Benefits. New recreational amenities for the benefit of the larger community shall be incorporated into the project design.

3.       Density and Land Use Compatibility. Residential projects shall not exceed a density greater than the density limitations of the surrounding golf course community.

F.       Project review. The ownership of the golf course facility shall apply for a change of zone application with the City’s Community Development Department. Said application shall accompany any supplemental applications (precise plan, tentative maps, environmental studies, etc.) and their required information. The applicant shall provide detailed information related to the compliance of their proposal with the Open Space/Residential Overlay. (Ord. 1340 § 2, 2018)

This topic has been modified. View the section for details. 25.34.030 Accessory Dwelling Units
A.      Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a mechanism to expand housing opportunities in the City by allowing accessory residential units under certain conditions in areas normally restricted to single-family and multi-family units and to preserve the character of surrounding neighborhoods. Regulations and permit requirements herein are intended to comply with the requirements of state law.

B.      Certificate of use and occupancy required. An accessory dwelling unit (accessory unit) shall be permitted within those residential zoning district identified in Table 25.10-1: “Use Matrix for Residential Districts” of the Zoning Ordinance and in compliance with the requirements of this section and other applicable provisions of this title.

C.      Requirements. Applications for an accessory unit must meet the following requirements:

1.       The parcel must contain an existing and permitted primary residential unit.

2.       The accessory unit shall provide complete and independent living facilities separate from the primary unit.

3.       The accessory unit shall have adequate sewer and water services as determined by the Coachella Valley Water District and shall not adversely impact vehicular traffic flow. Accessory units may, but are not required to, be metered separately from the primary unit.

4.       The accessory unit may be detached, attached, or incorporated within the living area of the existing primary unit.

5.       The living area of a detached or attached accessory unit shall not exceed 50 percent of the floor area of the permitted and constructed primary unit but in no event be less than 400 square feet or exceed 1,200 square feet in area.

6.       The unit shall only be for rental purposes or personal use of the property owner.

7.       The accessory unit may not be sold separately from the primary unit.

8.       Any new construction associated with the accessory unit shall comply with all setbacks, parking requirements, building coverage, height, landscape, and design standards contained within the base zoning district and shall not alter the general appearance of the primary unit as a single-family residence.

9.       The accessory unit and all related improvements including a garage or carport shall architecturally match and/or be compatible with the design of the primary unit.

10.     The accessory unit shall be provided with 1 off-street parking space per bedroom within a garage or carport, up to a maximum of 2 spaces. Off-street parking requirements may be eliminated or modified under the following circumstances:

a.       No off-street parking is required for accessory units located within one-half (1/2) mile of public transit.

b.       The accessory unit is located within an architecturally and historically significant historic district.

c.       No additional off-street parking is required when the accessory unit is part of the existing primary unit.

e.       No off-street parking is required when a car share vehicle is located within 1 block of the accessory unit.

D.      The primary unit shall be owner-occupied. If the property owner is unable to occupy the primary unit, it shall remain unoccupied during periods in which the accessory dwelling unit is rented. In no instance may both units be rented. A covenant memorializing this requirement shall be recorded against the property prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the accessory dwelling unit.

E.       Density limits don’t apply. An accessory unit which conforms to these requirements shall not be considered to exceed the allowable density for the lot upon which it is located, and shall be deemed to be a residential use consistent with the General Plan and Zoning and Land Use Ordinance designation for the lot. (Ord. 1321 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.34.040 Affordable Housing and Density Bonus Provisions
A.      Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide incentives for the production of housing for very low-income, lower-income, moderate-income, special needs, and senior households in the City and to establish procedures for carrying out the legislative requirements and complying with California Government Code Section 65915 et seq.

B.      Eligibility for density bonus and incentives and concessions. The City shall grant one density bonus, with concessions or incentives, as specified in Section 25.34.040.D (number and types of density bonuses and incentives and concessions allowed), when the applicant for the residential development seeks and agrees to construct a residential development, excluding any units permitted by the density bonus awarded pursuant to this article, that will contain at least one of the following. The applicant shall specify which of the following is the basis for the density bonus.

1.       10 percent of the total units of a housing development for lower-income households.

2.       5 percent of the total units of a housing development for very low-income households.

3.       A senior citizen housing development or age-restricted mobile home park.

4.       10 percent of the total dwelling units in a common interest development as defined in California Civil Code Section 1351 for persons and families of moderate income, provided that all units in the development are offered to the public for purchase.

C.      General provisions for density bonus and incentives and concessions. The following general requirements apply to the application and determination of all incentives and bonuses:

1.       Rounding. All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number; except that the percentage of total units proposed to qualify the development for a density bonus shall not be rounded up. For example, for a 200-unit project that proposes 21 lower-income units (or 10.5 percent), the allowed density bonus would be based on 10 percent lower-income units, not 11 percent.

2.       Relation to General Plan, Zoning. The granting of a density bonus, or a concession or incentive, shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a General Plan amendment, zoning change (rezone), or other discretionary approval.

3.       Density Bonus Excluded in Calculation. The density bonus shall not be included when calculating the total number of housing units that qualifies the housing development for a density bonus.

4.       Waived or Reduced Development Standards. The City shall not apply any development standard that would have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a housing development meeting the requirements of Section 25.34.040.B (eligibility for density bonus and incentives and concessions) at the densities or with the incentives or concessions permitted by this article. A proposed waiver or reduction of development standards shall neither reduce nor increase the number of allowable incentives or concessions under Section 25.34.040.D (number and types of density bonuses and incentives and concessions allowed). An applicant may submit to the City a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards, when standards would have the effect of physically precluding the proposed development, and may request a meeting with the City. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be interpreted to require the City to waive or reduce development standards if:

i.        The waiver or reduction would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5 of the California Government Code, upon health and safety or the physical environment and for which the City determines there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.

ii.       This would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources.

iii.     The waiver or reduction would be contrary to state or federal law.

5.       Multiple Zoning Districts. If the site of a development proposal is located in two or more zoning districts, the number of dwelling units permitted in the development is the sum of the dwelling units permitted in each of the zoning districts based on the site acreage within each zoning district. The permitted number of dwelling units may be distributed within the development without regard to the zone boundaries.

6.       City Authority. Nothing in this article shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the authority of the City to require a developer to donate land as a condition of development.

7.       Agreement Required.

i.        Prior to the award of a density bonus and any related incentives or concessions, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with the City to ensure the continued affordability of all target units.

ii.       For all target units, the agreement shall specify the household income classification, number, location, size, and construction scheduling and shall require target units in a project and phases of a project to be constructed concurrently with the construction of non-target units. The agreement shall include such other provisions as necessary to establish compliance with the requirements of this article.

D.      Number and types of density bonuses and incentives and concessions allowed.

1.       Density Bonus. A housing development that satisfies the eligibility requirements in Section 25.34.040.B (eligibility for density bonus and incentives and concessions) of this article shall be entitled to the following density bonus:

i.        For developments providing 10 percent lower-income target units, the City shall provide a 20 percent increase above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density as of the date of application, plus a 1.5 percent supplemental increase over that base for every 1 percent increase in low-income target units above 10 percent. The maximum density bonus allowed including supplemental increases is 35 percent.

ii.       For developments providing 5 percent very low-income target units, the City shall provide a 20 percent increase above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density as of the date of application, plus a 2.5 percent supplemental increase over that base for every 1 percent increase in very low-income target units above 5 percent. The maximum density bonus allowed including supplemental increases is 35 percent.

iii.     For senior citizen housing developments, a flat 20 percent of the number of senior units.

iv.      For common interest developments providing 10 percent moderate-income target units, the City shall provide a 5 percent increase above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density as of the date of application, plus a 1 percent increase in moderate-income units above 10 percent. The maximum density bonus allowed including supplemental increases is 35 percent.

2.       Number of Incentives or Concessions. In addition to the density bonus described in this section, an applicant may request specific incentives or concessions. The applicant shall receive the following number of incentives or concessions.

i.        One incentive or concession for projects that include at least 10 percent of the total units for lower-income households, at least 5 percent for very low-income households, or at least 10 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development.

ii.       Two incentives or concessions for projects that include at least 20 percent of the total units for lower-income households, at least 10 percent for very low-income households, or at least 20 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development.

iii.     Three incentives or concessions for projects that include at least 30 percent of the total units for lower-income households, at least 15 percent for very low-income households, or at least 30 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development.

iv.      The City shall grant the concession or incentive requested by the applicant unless it makes a written finding of either of the following:

a.       The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in subdivision (c).

b.       The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5 of the California Government Code, upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.

c.       The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal law.

3.       Available Incentives and Concessions.

i.        A reduction in the site development standards or a modification of the requirements of this title that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code, including but not limited to a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and in the ratio of vehicle parking spaces that would otherwise be required and that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.

ii.       Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing development if the nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and the nonresidential land uses are compatible with the housing development and existing or planned development in the area in which the housing development will be located.

iii.     Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the City that result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.

iv.      Priority processing of a housing development that qualifies for a density bonus based on income-restricted units.

4.       Additional Density Bonus and Incentives and Concessions for Donation of Land to the City.

i.        When an applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential development approval donates land to the City and agrees to include a minimum of 10 percent of the total units before the density bonus for very low-income households, the applicant shall be entitled to a 15 percent increase above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density, plus a 1 percent supplemental increase for each additional percentage of very low-income units to a maximum density bonus of 35 percent for the entire development.

ii.       The density bonus provided in this subsection shall be in addition to any other density bonus provided by this article up to a maximum combined density bonus of 35 percent.

iii.     The applicant shall be eligible for the increased density bonus described in this subsection if all of the following conditions are met:

a.       The applicant donates and transfers the land no later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application.

b.       The developable acreage and zoning designation of the land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very low-income households in an amount not less than 10 percent of the number of residential units of the proposed development.

c.       The transferred land is at least one acre in size or of sufficient size to permit development of at least 40 units, has the appropriate General Plan designation, is appropriately zoned with appropriate development standards for development at the density described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) of Section 65583.2 of the Government Code, and is or will be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure.

d.       The transferred land shall have all of the entitlements and approvals, other than building permits, necessary for the development of the very low-income housing units on the transferred land, not later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application, except that the City may subject the proposed development to subsequent design review to the extent authorized by subdivision (i) of Section 65583.2 of Government Code if the design is not reviewed by the City prior to the time of transfer.

e.       The transferred land and the affordable units shall be subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the units consistent with the requirements of this article which shall be recorded on the property at the time of the transfer.

f.        The land is transferred to the City or to a housing developer approved by the City.

g.       The transferred land shall be within the boundary of the proposed development or, if the City agrees, within one-quarter mile of the boundary of the proposed development.

iv.      Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the authority of the City to require a developer to donate land as a condition of development.

5.       Additional Density Bonus or Incentives and Concessions for Development of a Child Care Facility.

i.        Housing developments meeting the requirements of Section 25.34.040.B (eligibility for density bonus and incentives and concessions) and including a child care facility that will be located on the premises of, as part of, or adjacent to the housing development shall receive either of the following:

a.       An additional density bonus that is an amount of square footage of residential space that is equal to or greater than the amount of square footage in the child care facility.

b.       An additional incentive or concession that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility.

ii.       The City shall require the following as conditions of approving the housing development:

a.       The child care facility shall remain in operation for a period of time that is as long as or longer than the period of time during which the target units are required to remain affordable, pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 65915 of the Government Code.

b.       Of the children who attend the child care facility, the children of very low-income households, lower-income households, or persons or families of moderate income shall equal a percentage that is equal to or greater than the percentage of target units that are required pursuant to Section 25.34.040.B (eligibility for density bonus and incentives and concessions).

c.       Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the City shall not be required to provide a density bonus or incentive or concession for a child care facility if it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities.

E.       Location of density bonus units. The location of density bonus units within the housing development may be at the discretion of the developer. However, the target units shall be dispersed throughout the housing development and when feasible shall contain, on average, the same number of bedrooms as the non-target units in the development, and shall be compatible with the design or use of the remaining units in terms of appearance, materials, and quality finish.

F.       Continued availability.

1.       Minimum 30 Years. If a housing development provides low or very low-income target units to qualify for a density bonus, the target units must remain restricted to lower- or very low-income households for a minimum of 30 years from the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy by the building official, or longer if required by the project financing.

2.       Common Interest Housing. In the case of a common interest housing development providing moderate-income target units to qualify for a density bonus, the initial occupant of the target unit must be a person or family of moderate income. Upon resale, the seller of the target units shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller’s proportionate share of appreciation, and the City shall recapture any initial subsidy and its proportionate share of appreciation which shall then be used within three years for any of the purposes described in subdivision (e) of Section 33334.2 of the California Health and Safety Code that promote homeownership. The City’s initial subsidy shall be equal to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale minus the initial sale price to the moderate-income household, plus the amount of any down payment assistance or mortgage assistance. If upon resale the market value is lower than the initial market value, then the value at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value. The City’s proportionate share shall be equal to the percentage by which the initial sale price to the moderate-income household was less than the fair market value of the home at the time of the initial sale.

3.       Direct Financial Contributions. Where there is a direct financial contribution to a housing development pursuant to Government Code Section 65915, the City shall assure continued availability for low and moderate-income units for 30 years.

G.      Process for approval or denial.

1.       Process for Approval. The density bonus and incentive(s) and concession(s) request shall be considered in conjunction with any necessary development entitlements for the project. The designated approving authority for density bonuses, incentives, and concessions shall be the Council.

In the event that recorded covenants and/or affordable housing agreements already exist for persons and families of moderate income, low income and/or very low income in a multifamily complex or development which an applicant seeks to convert pursuant to this chapter, the applicant is required, and must demonstrate in its AHIP, that the moderate-income, low-income and very low-income unit(s) will remain available to persons and families of moderate income, low income and very low income, either by the recordation of new affordability covenants for the newly converted units, which shall be subject to prior review and approval by the City Manager or designee and the City attorney, or by continuing to rent converted units to qualified moderate-income, low-income and very low-income persons and families for the duration of the remaining recorded covenants and/or affordable housing agreements.

3.       That the average rental vacancy rate in apartment dwelling units within the City during the 24 months preceding the filing of the application is equal to or greater than 5 percent. Upon submission of the application, the City Manager or designee shall obtain, at applicant’s sole expense, a written study or report from an objective, unbiased third party which provides such studies and/or reports as part of its ordinary course and scope of business on a statewide or nationwide basis, which, in the reasonable opinion of the City Manager or designee, reflects that the average rental vacancy rate in apartment units then available in the City is 5 percent or higher. If the average rental vacancy rate in the City during the 24 months preceding the filing of the application is less than 5 percent or if as a result of the approval of said condominium conversion the vacancy rate would be less than 5 percent, the condominium conversion project shall be denied unless the Commission/Council determines that at least one of the following overriding considerations exist:

L.       Commission/Council determination. The Commission shall hold a duly noticed public hearing on a condominium conversion project, and the decision of the Commission shall be final unless a timely appeal is filed. When a timely appeal is filed to a decision of the Commission, the Council shall hold a public hearing on a condominium conversion project, and the decision of the Council shall be final and subject to appeal only by way of writ of mandate to a court of appropriate jurisdiction. A condominium conversion project conditional use permit may be approved subject to such conditions as the Commission/ Council may prescribe.

M.     Lapse of permit.

1.       Notwithstanding the time periods prescribed herein, a conditional use permit for a condominium conversion shall lapse and shall become void two years following the date on which the conversion conditional use permit became effective, unless prior to the expiration of two years, unless one of the following applies: (1) separate property interests have been created and recorded for each unit; (2) a building permit has been issued and reconstruction or other work necessary as a result of the conversion is commenced and diligently pursued toward completion on the site which was the subject of the conversion permit application; or (3) a certificate of occupancy has been issued for the structure(s) which was the subject of the conversion use permit application.

2.       A conversion conditional use permit subject to lapse may be renewed for an additional period of one year at the discretion of the Commission, provided that prior to the expiration date, a letter requesting renewal of the conversion conditional use permit is filed with the City Manager or designee.

N.      Exemptions. For residential developments, the conversion of existing apartments to a condominium project shall be exempt from the requirements of parkland dedication or parkland in-lieu fees if, on the date of conversion, the apartment complex is at least five years of age and no additional dwelling units are to be added as part of the conversion as provided in Section 66477(d) of the Subdivision Map Act.

A.      Purpose and intent. The regulations and requirements set forth herein are adopted for the following purposes:

1.       To provide for the location of commercial communication towers and commercial communication antennas in the City.

2.       To protect land uses from potential adverse impacts of commercial communication towers and antennas.

3.       To minimize adverse visual impacts of commercial communication towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques.

4.       To accommodate the growing need for commercial communication towers and antennas.

5.       To promote and encourage shared use/collocation of existing and new commercial communication towers as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers.

6.       To protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

7.       To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.

B.      Applicability.

1.       All new commercial communication towers and commercial communication antennas in Palm Desert shall be subject to these regulations and all other applicable regulations. For purposes of measurement, communication tower setbacks and separation distances, as delineated herein, shall be calculated and applied irrespective of municipal and county jurisdictional boundaries.

2.       All commercial communication towers and commercial communication antenna facilities existing on October 10, 1996 (the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter) shall be considered permitted uses, and allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist, provided, however, that anything other than routine maintenance, including without limitation structural modifications including provisions for additional antennas or additional providers and/or new construction on an existing commercial communication tower, shall comply with the requirements herein. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on such existing towers.

C.      Location.

1.       Commercial communication towers and commercial communication antennas shall not be permitted in any residential zoning district in the City.

ii.       Shall not exceed 50 percent of the building height.

 

D.      Permit requirements and exemptions. Except as otherwise outlined below, a conditional use permit as established by Section 25.72.050 (Conditional Use Permit) is required for all wireless communication facilities.

1.       In order to ensure compliance with the requirements of 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7)(B), an applicant that believes that the City’s prohibition of wireless telecommunications facilities in particular zoning districts or any of the standards in this chapter either (a) unreasonably discriminates among providers or functionally equivalent services, or (b) prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting the requirement of personal wireless services may apply for a conditional use permit. In order for such permit to be granted, the decision-maker must find, in addition to all other required findings for the granting of a conditional use permit, that substantial evidence in the written record establishes that either of the above stated criteria is met.

2.       Collocation. Administrative review and approval may be available, so long as a collocation facility satisfies all requirements set forth in Section 65850.6 of the California Government Code.

E.       Findings. New freestanding commercial communication towers/commercial communication antennas shall not be allowed unless the applicant substantiates to the satisfaction of the Commission:

1.       That existing towers and buildings do not technologically afford the applicant the ability to provide service to the service area of the applicant or service provider.

2.       That the geographical boundaries of the proposed service area cannot technologically be bifurcated to avoid the necessity for a freestanding tower/antenna at the height proposed.

3.       That the applicant shows compelling technological or economic reason(s) for requiring a new freestanding facility.

F.       Standards. The following performance and construction standards apply to commercial communication towers and commercial communication antennas.

9.       Illumination. Commercial communication towers/antennas shall not be artificially lighted except to ensure human safety or as required by the Federal Aviation Administration.

G.      Collocation.

1.       Proposed commercial communication antennas may, and are encouraged to, collocate onto existing commercial communication towers, provided that such collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with this section. Such collocation is permitted without amendment of the existing conditional use permit if no additional modification to the tower is proposed.

2.       Any request to collocate a new antenna within the required separation radius of an existing tower shall be required to collocate on the existing tower. Any modification of that existing tower is subject to the conditional use permit process.

3.       If determined by the City that the proposed commercial tower is situated in a location which will benefit the City’s telecommunication systems, then the tower shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate the additional telecommunicating equipment beneficial to the public system at a cost to the City no greater than the actual expense of the provider in so engineering and constructing the tower to meet the City’s needs.

4.       Where collocation may effectively be accomplished without violation of the provisions of this chapter and without reasonable interference with the applicant’s existing use, the applicant shall allow third-party collocation on any tower erected under this chapter. Applicant may charge a reasonable rental fee for such collocated use to the extent allowed by law.

H.      Noninterference. No commercial communication tower or antenna shall interfere with public safety communication. Frequency coordination is required to ensure noninterference with public safety system and/or public safety entities.

K.      Signs and advertising. The use of any portion of a commercial communication tower for signs or advertising purposes, including, without limitation, company name, banners, or streamers, is prohibited.

L.       Abandonment. In the event the use of any commercial communication tower has been discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional 180 days within which to: (1) reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or (2) dismantle and remove the tower. At the earlier of 181 days from the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, any variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire.

M.     Exception process—Applicability. The Commission may approve exceptions relative to:

1.       Zoning districts on which commercial communication towers and commercial communication antennas may be located.

2.       Height of building mounted commercial communication antennas.

3.       Separation distances between residential zoned lands or residential uses and commercial communication towers.

4.       Separation distances between commercial communication towers.

N.      Exception process—Findings. The Commission shall make the following findings to approve exceptions.

1.       That there is a unique land use characteristic or nearby geographic feature which results in a compelling technological need to locate the commercial communication towers and/or commercial communication antennas in the location and/or at the height proposed.

2.       That the unique land use characteristics or geographic features mitigate any negative aesthetic concerns.

O.      Stealth installation. Stealth installation of commercial communication towers and antennas are those determined by the ARC and the Commission to be designed to blend in with their existing natural environment (e.g., monopoles designed as artificial palm trees), creating a cluster effect through the use of a mix of artificial and natural vegetation. In addition to the aforementioned sections, stealth installations shall be subject to the following development standards:

1.       Height. No stealth commercial communication tower or antenna shall exceed 65 feet in height as measured from ground level to top of the antenna. Frond or artificial vegetation height shall not exceed more than 10 feet from the top of the antenna.

2.       Separation from Off-Site Uses and Other Commercial Communication Towers.

i.        The Commission may waive the separation requirements from residential zoned properties and residential uses if it is determined that the tower or antenna utilizes an approved stealth design (e.g., artificial palm tree).

ii.       The Commission may waive the separation requirements between commercial communication towers if determined that the tower or antenna utilizes an approved stealth design (e.g., artificial palm tree). (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

Chapter 25.40 SITE DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONS
25.40.010 Purpose and Applicability
The development standards contained within this chapter supplement the development standards and special provisions that apply within each use district. The general provisions and the special standards shall govern all uses and structures in every zone in addition to the development standards within each zone. No structure or use may hereafter be constructed, substantially changed, relocated, operated, occupied, established, or maintained on a lot unless it conforms to all the general provisions and the development standards that apply within the zone in which it is located. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.40.020 Yard Measurements
A.      Yard measurements. Required front, side, and rear yards shall be measured as the minimum horizontal distance from the property line of the site or street right-of-way line to a line parallel thereto on the site, except:

1.       Where a specific street plan has been adopted by the Council, site area and required yards shall be measured from the plan line, and no provisions of this title shall be construed to permit a structure or use to extend beyond such line.

2.       Where a site abuts on a street having only a portion of its required width dedicated or reserved for street purposes, site area and required yards shall be measured from a line drawn on the boundary of the additional width required for street purposes abutting the site.

B.      Lot width reductions for cul-de-sacs and knuckles. No site shall have less than the required lot width as prescribed in the applicable zone district, except lots fronting on cul-de-sac or knuckle streets may have 35 feet of frontage.

E.       Front, side and rear yard setback exceptions.

1.       Front and/or rear yard setbacks may be reduced by up to 25 percent of the required setback provided that the average of each such setback, when considered on an individual basis, is not less than the minimum required for the district (i.e., a 50-foot wide dwelling which chooses to utilize a 25 percent reduction for 25 feet of its width must provide a setback at least 25 percent greater than the minimum prescribed setback for the remaining 25 feet of its width).

i.        Notwithstanding the preceding, in the R1 8,000 district the minimum rear yard may be reduced to 10 feet provided that the average of the rear yard setback complies with the 15-foot requirement.

ii.       Notwithstanding the preceding in the R1 district, the required minimum front setback to a garage door shall be 20 feet measured from the property line and for a side entry garage 16 feet measured from the property line. To encourage the rehabilitation of older units and the provision of off-street parking within garages, on lots with existing homes that are legal nonconforming because they do not provide a minimum of 2 covered off-street parking spaces, the required minimum front setback to a garage door shall be 26 feet measured from street curb face.

2.       In addition to the provisions of subsection A of this section, the required front, rear and side yard setbacks on an irregularly shaped lot may be reduced by as much as 20 percent upon a showing that:

i.        The lot in question is irregular in shape (i.e., the lot has significantly less width or depth than the typical lot in the subdivision or the lot has more than 4 boundary lines and the dimensions prevent a home typical of the neighborhood from being placed on the lot; and

ii.       The ARC makes a determination that the reduced setback(s) will not have a detrimental impact on the neighborhood.

3.       In order to encourage rehabilitation of older dwelling units and to provide shaded parking for vehicles, the ARC may approve well designed carport structures with a minimum setback of 20 feet to be measured from the curb face to the front edge of the carport structure. Side-in carport structures may be approved to a minimum setback of 16 feet measured from the curb face to the nearest projection of the carport. In approving such setback, the ARC shall send a notice to property owners within 300 feet of the property and make a determination that the reduced setback will not have a detrimental impact on the neighborhood, taking into account the opinions of nearby property owners and any property owners associations.

The purpose is to specify location, material, and review procedures to remove all ambiguity and achieve consistency throughout the City. The objective is to protect and reconcile the often conflicting goals of aesthetics, privacy, security, view sight lines, and drainage.

B.      Review procedures. All applications for fences and walls may be subject to on-site inspection prior to approval. Photographs of the subject property and adjacent properties may be sufficient to demonstrate any impacts the wall(s) may create. In addition, retaining walls will require approval by the public works department.

C.      Wall requirement—New residential construction. All new residential construction shall include walls or fences of a minimum of 5 feet in height enclosing rear and interior side yards.

Chapter 25.52 LANDSCAPING
25.52.010 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum landscape standards to enhance the appearance of developments, provide shade, reduce heat and glare, control soil erosion, conserve water, ensure the ongoing maintenance of landscape areas, and ensure that landscape installations do not create hazards for motorists or pedestrians. All landscaping shall be planted and maintained according to Chapter 24.04 (Water-Efficient Landscape), and the landscape installation and maintenance guidelines in such a manner to maximize the growth, health, and longevity of the plantings. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.52.020 Applicability
The regulations of this chapter apply to new and existing development, as follows. Deviations from the development standards of this article may be allowed on a case-by-case basis by the designated approving authority through site plan and architectural review.

A.      New projects. New commercial, industrial, mixed-use, multifamily residential and single-family residential projects shall be reviewed by the designated approving authority to ensure landscaping is provided in compliance with the requirements of this article and Chapter 24.04 (Water-Efficient Landscape).

B.      Existing development. Where an existing nonresidential, mixed-use, and/or multifamily residential project requests an amendment that increases the building square footage by 10 percent or more, the designated approving authority shall evaluate the existing landscape to ensure compliance with applicable requirements of this chapter and Chapter 24.04 (Water-Efficient Landscape). (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.52.030 Residential Landscape Provisions
A.      Single-family residential landscape installations equal to or greater than 5,000 square feet in size installed as part of new construction or remodel are subject to the standards of Chapter 24.04 (Water-Efficient Landscape) of the municipal code.

B.      For residential districts, at least 25 percent of the lot area shall be pervious surface. No more than 40 percent of the front yard area shall be non-pervious surface (e.g., used as a driveway). Deviations from these standards may be allowed through site plan and architectural review for small-lot single-family developments at the time of master home plan review where these standards preclude the maximum lot coverage from being achieved.

C.      Remaining unpaved portion of the setback areas shall be landscaped, irrigated, and maintained. All landscaping shall be maintained per the City’s Maintenance Guidelines and/or as often as necessary to prevent a nuisance. No junk, debris, or other similar materials shall be stored in the landscaped areas.

D.      Landscaping shall be designed to prevent irrigation water from flowing over paved surfaces. Techniques include:

1.       Off-setting any turf areas from driveways and sidewalks a minimum of 24 inches to prevent overspray from sprinklers.

2.       Using a subterranean irrigation system (versus spray irrigation) or drip irrigation system.

3.       Other water conservation techniques.

E.       A minimum of two 24-inch box shade trees are required within the front yard setback of all single-family residences.

G:\Planning\Tony Bagato\Staff Reports\ZOA\Zoning Ordinance\Final Edit_Second Reading\High Resolution Images\25.52-3---Parking-Lot-Landscaping-Requirements.jpg

C.      Tree requirements.

1.       The intent of this code is to improve and maximize the landscaping within the off-street open parking areas to provide 50 percent or more of shade coverage in 10 years. In order to achieve this coverage, the applicant shall plant single-trunk, low-branching trees in windy areas, and design, where possible, north/south-oriented parking areas to provide maximum shade. Landscaping shall be provided and maintained to the extent that at least one medium- or large-scale tree is planted for every three parking stalls. A diversity of tree species is required.

2.       The minimum size tree planted shall be no less than a 24-inch box tree, sized to specifications according to the American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1) and Arizona Nursery Association Grower’s standards.

3.       Low water use and native plant materials shall be encouraged and used to the greatest extent possible.

4.       Problematic trees having shallow or invasive roots or having brittle or weak branching structure shall be prohibited.

2.       All new awnings, including color change to existing awnings, shall require design review required by Section 25.68.050 (Sign Design Review).

3.       Comprehensive sign programs shall be reviewed for compliance with Section 25.68.060 (Comprehensive Sign Programs).

4.       Individual signs for any building with more than 100 lineal feet of building frontage facing a public or private right-of-way shall be reviewed according to Section 25.68.050 (Sign Design Review).

5.       Any sign that the Director determines should be reviewed by the ARC due to the unique design, context, color, size, shape, location, or circumstance of the sign are subject to the requirements of Section 25.68.050 (Sign Design Review).

E.       Sign review criteria. In approving or rejecting a sign permit application, the reviewing authority shall consider the design review criteria provided herein. The design criteria shall not be construed or applied in a manner as to violate any legal rights bestowed by state or federal law. The reviewing authority shall find:

1.       That the sign is necessary for the applicant’s enjoyment of substantial trade and property rights;

2.       That the sign is consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter and title;

3.       That the sign does not constitute a detriment to public health, safety and welfare;

4.       That the size, shape, color, height, and placement of the sign is compatible with and will have a harmonious relationship to the building it identifies, the surrounding neighborhoods, and other signs in the area;

5.       That both the location of the proposed sign and the design of its visual elements (lettering, words, figures, colors, decorative motifs, spacing, and proportions) are legible under normal viewing conditions prevailing where the sign is to be located;

6.       That the location, height, and design of the proposed sign does not obscure from view or unduly detract from existing or adjacent signs;

7.       That the location and design of the proposed sign, its size, shape, illumination, and color are compatible with the visual characteristics of the surrounding area so as not to detract from or cause depreciation of the value of adjacent developed properties;

8.       That the location and design of a proposed sign in close proximity to a residential district does not adversely affect the value or character of the adjacent residential uses;

9.       That any neon tubing used in conjunction with any sign is incorporated as an integral part of the sign design with careful attention to color, intensity of light, and the use of colors that are not overly bright; and

10.     That the quantity of information displayed in the sign does not cause visual clutter. (Ord. 1331 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

25.56.060 General Provisions for All Signs
A.      Compliance required. No person shall erect, re-erect, construct, enlarge, alter, change copy, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, or equip any sign or sign structure in the City, or cause or permit the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter.

B.      Uncertainty of chapter provisions. The ARC shall have the authority to interpret the provisions of this chapter at the request of the Director, or when an appeal of a decision of the Director is filed with the ARC.

C.      Sign integration requirement. All signs shall be designed as an integral part of the overall building design and shall be located in a manner consistent with the building’s design.

D.      Sign construction. Signs that are not temporary signs shall be constructed of permanent materials, including, but not limited to, metal, wood, acrylic, or other comparable durable weatherproof materials.

E.       Sign area computation. The area of signs shall be calculated according to Figure 25.56-1 (Sign Area Calculations).

 

Figure 25.56-1: Sign Area Calculations

 

G:\Planning\Tony Bagato\Staff Reports\ZOA\Zoning Ordinance\Final Edit_Second Reading\High Resolution Images\25.56-2---Sign-Area-Calculations.jpg

1.       The area of a sign shall be measured within a single continuous perimeter of not more than 8 straight lines enclosing the extreme limits of writing, representation, emblem, or any figure of similar character, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the background against which it is placed.

2.       In the case of a sign designed with more than 1 exterior surface (e.g., 2 sides), the area shall be computed as including only the maximum single display surface that is visible from any ground position at 1 time.

3.       The supports, uprights, or structure on which any sign is supported shall not be included in determining the sign area unless the supports, uprights, or structures are designed in a manner as to form an integral background of the display.

F.       Sign height measurement—Freeway-oriented monument signs and monument signs. The height of a monument sign shall be measured from the highest part of the text area of the sign to the grade of the adjacent street or the surface grade beneath the sign, whichever the Director determines is appropriate given the physical characteristics of the site. Decorative features of the sign approved by the ARC may be excluded from the measurement of sign height.

G:\Planning\Tony Bagato\Staff Reports\ZOA\Zoning Ordinance\Final Edit_Second Reading\High Resolution Images\25.56-3---Sign-Height-Measurement---Monument-Signs.jpg

 

G.      Sign height—Wall signs. The uppermost part of a wall-mounted sign shall not be higher than the eave line of the building on which it is located as measured from the underside of the eave and in no event higher than 20 feet.

 

Figure 25.56-3: Sign Height Measurement–Wall Signs

G:\Planning\Tony Bagato\Staff Reports\ZOA\Zoning Ordinance\Final Edit_Second Reading\High Resolution Images\25.56-4---Sign-Height-Measurement---Wall-Signs.jpg

 

H.      Electrical raceways and conduits. Electrical raceways and conduits shall be placed so that they are not within public view. Where this is physically impractical, or doing so would damage significant architectural features or materials, the ARC may grant a waiver of this requirement provided all raceways, conduits, and similar devices are designed in a way that they appear to be part of the overall sign or building design.

I.        Frontage on 2 or more streets. A business on a lot that has frontage on more than 1 street shall be allowed the authorized sign area on each street; provided, that the permitted sign areas may not be accumulated on 1 street and shall not exceed the allowed sign area of any 1 street.

J.       Sign removal or replacement. When a sign is removed all brackets, poles, and other structural elements that supported the sign shall also be completely removed. All holes and affected building surfaces shall be restored to match the adjacent portion of the building.

K.      Sign colors. The standards for signs in this chapter are premised aesthetically on the use of limited colors per sign so as to minimize excessive contrast and thereby establish more readable, less confusing signs. Signs for commercial complexes, shopping centers, other commercial and industrial development, including individual businesses, shall be limited by the following:

1.       Signs shall be limited to a maximum of 3 colors per sign. If a federally regulated trademark sign has more than 3, then the maximum size allowed for that sign shall be reduced by 20 percent for each additional color.

2.       For purposes of calculating reductions in size where more than 3 colors are involved, the maximum sign size resulting from the first 20 percent reduction shall form the basis for the second 20 percent reduction, and so on for each subsequent 20 percent reduction. For example, if the maximum size allowed for a given 3-color sign is 10 square feet, then the maximum size allowed for a 5-color sign would be 6.4 square feet: 80% x (10 x 80%).

3.       The ARC may waive the above-noted required size reduction or part thereof if it specifically finds that the proposed sign is desirable due to its quality, uniqueness, design, or other features determined by the ARC.

L.       Illuminated signs and lights. The following standards shall apply to all illuminated signs:

1.       All illuminated signs shall be designed with a dimmer system to avoid undue glare or reflection of light on private property in the surrounding area.

2.       External light sources shall be shielded from view and directed to illuminate only the sign face (see Figure 25.56-4 below).

Figure 25.56-4: Sign Illumination

 

G:\Planning\Tony Bagato\Staff Reports\ZOA\Zoning Ordinance\Final Edit_Second Reading\High Resolution Images\25.56-5---Sign-Illumination.jpg

 

3.       Internal illumination is permitted only if the sign background is opaque and the only portion of the sign that appears as illuminated is the actual lettering and/or a registered trademark or logo.

4.       Reflective-type bulbs and incandescent lamps shall not be used on the exterior surface of signs so that the bulb or lamp is exposed to view from any direction.

5.       Each new illuminated sign shall be subject to a 30-day review period during which time the Director may determine that a reduction in illumination is necessary due to negative impacts on surrounding property or the community in general. In addition, and at any time, the Director may order the dimming of any illumination found to be excessively bright.

M.     Signs to face public or private right-of-way. All signs permitted under this chapter shall be placed on the side of property facing a public or private right-of-way.

N.      Maintenance of signs.

1.       For the public health, safety, and welfare all signs shall be maintained in a safe, presentable, and good structural condition at all times, including the replacement of defective parts, wiring, ballast, painting, repainting, cleaning, and other acts required for the maintenance of the sign. If the sign is not made to comply with safety standards, the Director shall require its immediate repair or removal in compliance with this chapter.

2.       Signs illuminated either internally or externally shall be capable of being fully illuminated and legible with the face(s) intact (without holes or other exterior damage). Any illuminated sign not in compliance with these and other maintenance standards in this section shall be cited by the Director and shall be brought into compliance with applicable standards or proof of a contract for repair and maintenance shall be approved within 30 days or shall be subject to abatement as a public nuisance. Illuminated signs that, because of expired or damaged lighting elements, become non-legible shall be ordered to remain unlighted until repaired.

3.       When a sign is removed or replaced, all brackets, poles, and other structural elements that supported the sign shall also be removed. Affected building surfaces shall be restored to match the adjacent portion of the structure.

4.       In the case of abandoned signs, the identification, name, and copy pertaining to the abandoned business shall be removed and replaced with a blank panel or white space within 30 days of vacating the business.

5.       When it is determined by the City that a sign may cause imminent danger to the public safety and contact cannot be made with a sign owner or building owner, no written notice shall be required. In this situation, the City may correct the danger. The City shall Cause to have removed any sign that endangers the public safety, including abandoned, materially dangerous, electrically, or structurally defective signs.

6.       Notices of violation shall be sent by the Director by certified mail. Time periods provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date of the mailing. Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the citation ordering the removal of compliance by filing a written notice of appeal with the Director within 30 days after the date of mailing the notice, or 30 days after receipt if the notice was not mailed.

7.       Signs removed by the City shall become the property of the City and may be disposed of in any matter deemed appropriate by the City. The cost of the removal of any sign by the City shall be considered a debt owed to the City by the owner of the sign and the owner of the property and may be recovered in an appropriate court action by the City or by assessment against the property. The cost of removal shall include any incidental expenses incurred by the City in connection with the sign’s removal. (Ord. 1331 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.56.070 Permanent Signs
A.      Purpose. The number and area of signs as provided in this chapter are intended to be maximum standards. However, the standards do not necessarily ensure architectural compatibility. Therefore, in addition to the enumerated standards, the approving authority shall also give consideration to a sign’s relationship to the overall appearance of the subject property, as well as the surrounding community with the goal being to minimize visual pollution, excessive illumination, and excessive contrasting colors. Compatible design, simplicity, and sign effectiveness are to be used in establishing guidelines for sign approval.

B.      Relationship to other provisions. The tables contained within this section provide regulations for permanent signs in residential and nonresidential zoning districts. References in the last column provide additional regulations for specific sign types located elsewhere in this chapter. In the case of an inconsistency between regulations provided in the tables and regulations provided for specific sign types, the regulations for specific sign types shall take precedence.

C.      Signs allowed in residential zoning district. Table 25.56-1 (Signs Allowed in Residential Zoning Districts) provides dimension and other development standards.

25.56.100 Comprehensive Sign Program
A.      Purpose. The purpose of a comprehensive sign program is to integrate all of a nonresidential project’s signs with the overall site design and the structures’ design into a unified architectural statement. A comprehensive sign program provides a means for the flexible application of sign regulations in order to provide incentive and latitude in the design and display of multiple signs and to achieve, not circumvent, the purpose of this chapter. Approval of a comprehensive sign program may modify the standards provided in this chapter as to sign number, size, height, illumination, location, orientation, or other aspects of signs within the limits of this section.

B.      Applicability. The approval of a comprehensive sign program by the ARC shall be required whenever any of the following circumstances exist:

1.       Whenever 3 or more separate tenant spaces are present on the same site.

2.       Whenever 3 or more nonexempt signs are proposed for a single tenant.

3.       Whenever signs are proposed to be located on the second story on a multistory building.

4.       Whenever an existing multitenant development of 3 or more tenants is being remodeled or rehabilitated to the extent that it requires review and approval by the ARC.

5.       Whenever the Director determines that a comprehensive sign program is needed because of special project characteristics (e.g., the size of proposed signs, limited site visibility, the location of the site relative to other lots, buildings, or streets, etc.).

C.      Application requirements. A sign permit application for a comprehensive sign program shall include all information and materials required by the Director.

D.      Standards. A comprehensive sign program shall comply with the following standards:

1.       The proposed sign program shall comply with the purpose and intent of this chapter.

2.       The proposed signs shall enhance the overall development, be in harmony with, and relate visually to other signs included in the comprehensive sign program, to the structures and/or developments they identify, and to surrounding development when applicable.

3.       The sign program shall address all signs, including permanent, temporary, and exempt signs.

4.       The sign program shall accommodate future revisions that may be required because of changes in use or tenants.

5.       The sign program shall comply with the standards of this chapter, except that deviations are allowed with regard to sign area, total number, location, and/or height of signs to the extent that the comprehensive sign program will enhance the overall development and will more fully accomplish the purposes and intent of this chapter.

6.       Approval of a comprehensive sign program shall not authorize the use of signs prohibited by this chapter.

 

7.       Review and approval of a comprehensive sign program shall not consider the signs’ proposed message content.

E.       Findings. In order to approve a comprehensive sign program the following findings shall be made:

1.       The comprehensive sign program complies with the purpose of this chapter, including the design criteria.

2.       Proposed signs enhance the overall development and are in harmony with other signs included in the plan with the structures they identify and with surrounding development.

3.       The comprehensive sign program contains provisions to accommodate future revisions that may be required because of changes in use or tenants.

4.       The comprehensive sign program complies with the standards of this chapter, except that flexibility is allowed with regard to sign area, number, location, and/or height to the extent that the signs proposed under the comprehensive sign program will enhance the overall development, achieve superior quality design, and will more fully accomplish the purposes of this chapter.

F.       Revisions to comprehensive sign programs. The Director may approve revisions to a comprehensive sign program if the intent of the original approval is not affected. Revisions that would substantially deviate from the original approval shall require the approval of a new/revised comprehensive sign program by the ARC. (Ord. 1331 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.56.110 Nonconforming Signs
A.      Lawfully permitted nonconforming signs.

1.       Lawfully permitted on-premises signs existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter on September 10, 2009, that do not comply with the requirements of this chapter shall be deemed lawful nonconforming signs.

2.       Nonconforming signs shall not be expanded, extended, rebuilt, altered, or reconstructed in any way, except for normal maintenance or to protect public safety.

3.       It shall be the express responsibility of the seller of property or a business to advise the buyer of the provisions of this section relating to the removal of nonconforming signs upon the transfer of ownership of a business.

B.      Lawful nonconforming signs to be removed. It shall be the responsibility of the business owner, sign owner, or property owner to ensure compliance with this section. Nonconforming signs shall be removed or made to comply with the requirements of this chapter as follows:

1.       Within 30 days of the issuance of a sign permit application for a sign on a property on which a nonconforming sign(s) exists. Prior to the issuance for a property on which a nonconforming sign(s) exists, the applicant or owner shall file with the City an irrevocable bond in the amount of $10,000.00 to guarantee the nonconforming sign(s) shall removed or made to conform with the requirements of this chapter within a specified time.

2.       Upon the transfer of ownership of the business.

3.       Upon the altering of the nonconforming sign or sign structure in any way or the addition of new sign(s) or a new sign structure.

4.       After 90 days of the discontinuance of a business or before a new business occupies the building, whichever comes first.

C.      Nonconforming signs maintenance. Except for normal repair or maintenance not exceeding 50 percent of the value of the sign, nonconforming signs shall not be modified, altered, moved, or replaced except in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

D.      Lawful nonconforming off-site signs (i.e., billboards). Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit the ability of an owner of a lawful nonconforming off-site sign (i.e., billboard) to periodically change advertising copy. (Ord. 1331 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

A.      Removal of abandoned signs.

1.       An abandoned sign or an abandoned nonconforming sign shall be removed within 30 days by the owner or lessee of the premises upon which the sign is located or by a person, organization, or other entity that directly or indirectly receives a benefit from the information contained on the sign. All wording advertising or relating to the discontinued business shall be removed from all nonconforming signs.

2.       A sign frame or structure that has been abandoned shall be removed within 30 days by the owner or lessee of the premises upon which the sign frame or structure is located.

B.      Presumption that a sign is abandoned. A sign that identifies or advertises a business that has ceased; is located upon a structure that has been abandoned by its owner; has not identified a bona fide business, lessor, service, owner, product, or activity available upon the site, for more than 90 days shall be presumed abandoned.

C.      Notice that a sign is presumed abandoned. The Director shall send the person responsible for a sign presumed to be abandoned an abandoned sign notification. Failure of the person to respond within 30 days to the abandoned sign notification shall serve as prima facie evidence of intentional permanent abandonment of the sign. (Ord. 1331 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

Chapter 25.60 PROCEDURES
25.60.010 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the general requirements of this title for the review and approval of proposed development and new land uses in the City. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.020 Application and Fee
A.      Application. Applications pertaining to this title shall be submitted in writing to the Director on a completed City application form designated for the particular request. Every application shall include the signatures of the applicant and property owner, agent authorization as appropriate, and any fee prescribed by Council resolution to cover the cost of investigation and processing. Applications shall be submitted together with all plans, maps, and data about the proposed project development or land use entitlements requested, project site, and vicinity deemed necessary by the Director to provide the approving authority with adequate information on which to base decisions. Each permit application checklist lists the minimum necessary submittal materials for that particular type of permit.

B.      Fee. The Council sets, by resolution, the fees for processing the various applications authorized or required by this code. All required fees shall be paid at the time an application is filed and no processing shall commence until the fee is paid in full. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.030 Determination of Completeness
A.      Application completeness. Within 30 days of application submittal, the Director shall determine whether or not the application is complete. The Director shall notify the applicant in writing of the determination that either:

1.       All the submittal requirements have been satisfied and the application has been accepted as complete.

2.       Specific information is still necessary to complete the application. The letter may also identify preliminary information regarding the areas in which the submitted plans are not in compliance with City standards and requirements.

B.      Application completeness without notification. If the written determination is not made within 30 days after receipt, and the application includes a statement that it is an application for a development permit, the application shall be deemed complete for purposes of this chapter.

C.      Resubmittal. Upon receipt and resubmittal of any incomplete application, a new 30-day period shall begin during which the Director shall determine the completeness of the application.

D.      Incomplete application. If additional information or submittals are required and the application is not made complete within one year, or some greater period as determined by the Director, of the completeness determination letter, the application may be deemed by the City to have been withdrawn and no action will be taken on the application. Unexpended fees, as determined by the Director, will be returned to the applicant. If the applicant subsequently wishes to pursue the project, a new application, including fees, plans, exhibits, and other materials, must then be filed in compliance with this article.

E.       Right to appeal. The applicant may appeal the determination in accordance with Section 25.60.080 (Appeals) and the Permit Streamlining Act (California Government Code Section 65943). (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.040 Environmental Analysis
A.      Intent and purpose. It is the intent of this chapter to relate the provisions of this title and all other applicable projects to the appropriate City provisions that have been adopted in order to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 and subsequent standards as established by the state legislature, the Secretary of Resources, and the City.

B.      Scope of regulations. This chapter shall be applied pursuant to the adopted “Resolution of the City Council of the City of Palm Desert Establishing Procedures to Implement the Environmental Quality Act of 1970,” as amended. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.050 Application Review and Report
After acceptance of a complete application, the project shall be reviewed in accordance with the environmental review procedures of the California Environmental Quality Act. The Director will consult with other departments and committees as appropriate to ensure compliance with all provisions of the municipal code and other adopted policies and plans. The Director will prepare a report to the designated approving authority describing the project, and his or her recommendation to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application. The report shall be provided to the applicant prior to consideration of the entitlement request. The report may be amended as necessary or supplemented with additional information at any time prior to the hearing to address issues or information not reasonably known at the time the report is prepared. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.060 Public Hearing and Public Notice
A.      Public hearing required. The following procedures shall govern the notice and public hearing, where required pursuant to this title. The designated approving authority shall hold a public hearing to consider all applications for a conditional use permit, variance, architectural review, precise plan, planned development, specific plan, zoning code and/or map amendment, pre-zoning, development agreement, and General Plan amendment considered by the Commission or Council.

B.      Notice of hearing. Pursuant to California Government Code Sections 65090 to 65094, not less than 10 days before the scheduled date of a hearing, public notice shall be given of such hearing in the manner listed below. The notice shall state the date, time, and place of hearing, identify the hearing body, and provide a general description of the matter to be considered and the real property which is the subject of the hearing.

1.       Notice of public hearing shall be published in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the City.

2.       Except as otherwise provided herein, notice of the public hearing shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the owners of property within a radius of 300 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property involved in the application, using for this purpose the last known name and address of such owners as shown upon the current tax assessor’s records. The radius may be increased as determined to be necessary and desirable by the Director based on the nature of the proposed project. If the number of owners exceeds 1,000, the City may, in lieu of mailed notice, provide notice by placing notice of at least one-eighth (1/8) page in one newspaper of general circulation within the City.

3.       Notice of the public hearing shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the owner of the subject real property or the owner’s authorized agent and to each local agency expected to provide water, sewerage, streets, roads, schools, or other essential facilities or services to the proposed project.

4.       Notice of the public hearing shall be posted at City Hall.

5.       Notice of the public hearing shall be mailed to any person who has filed a written request for notice.

6.       In addition to the notice required by this section, the City may give notice of the hearing in any other manner it deems necessary or desirable.

C.      Notice of Zoning Administrator decision.

1.       Notice. The notice of decision shall be provided, in writing, to the applicant, interested parties, neighborhood associations within proximity of the subject site, and properties within 300 feet of the property. The notice shall include:

i.        A brief statement explaining the criteria and standards considered relevant to the decision.

ii.       A statement of the standards and facts relied upon in rendering the decision.

iii.     Findings as listed for each entitlement or justification for the decision based on the criteria, standards, and facts set forth.

iv.      An explanation of appeal rights and appeal deadlines.

2.       Decision. The ZA may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. Decisions shall be based on standards and criteria set forth within this code and shall be accompanied by brief, written findings and a determination.

3.       Appeal. A ZA determination may be appealed to the Commission for a final determination according to Section 25.60.080.

D.      Requests for notification. Any person who requests to be on a mailing list for notice of hearing shall submit such request in writing to the Department. The City may impose a reasonable fee for the purpose of recovering the cost of such notification.

E.       Receipt of notice. Failure of any person or entity to receive any properly issued notice required by law for any hearing required by this title shall not constitute grounds for any court to invalidate the actions of a designated approving authority for which the notice was given.

F.       Hearing procedure. Hearings as provided for in this chapter shall be held at the date, time, and place for which notice has been given as required in this chapter. The approving authority shall conduct the public hearing and hear testimony from interested persons. The summary minutes shall be prepared and made part of the permanent file of the case. Any hearing may be continued to a date certain. If the hearing is not continued to a specific date/time, then the hearing shall be re-noticed. (Ord. 1303 § 6, 2016; Ord. 1279 § 10, 2015; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.070 Approving Authority
A.      Designated approving authority. The approving authority as designated in Table 25.60-1 (Approving Authority for Land Use Permits/Entitlements) shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed land use or development permit or entitlement in accordance with the requirements of this title.

Footnote:

1.     A final determination is made by the ARC for design-related decisions as specified in Chapter 25.68 (Decisions by the Architectural Review Commission).

 

B.      Multiple entitlements. When a proposed project requires more than one permit with more than one approving authority, all project permits shall be processed concurrently and final action shall be taken by the highest-level designated approving authority for all such requested permits.

C.      Referral to the Commission. At any point in the application review process, the Director may transfer decision-making authority to the Commission at his/her discretion because of policy implications, unique or unusual circumstances, or the magnitude of the project. Decisions referred to the Commission shall be considered as a noticed public hearing. A referral to another decision-maker is not an appeal and requires no appeal application or fee. (Ord. 1292 § 3, 2015; Ord. 1279 § 11, 2015; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.080 Appeals
A.      Appeal authority. Any interested person may appeal certain actions of the ZA, Director or Commission made pursuant to this article to the designated appeal authority listed in Table 25.60-1 (Approving Authority for Land Use Permits/Entitlements) within 15 calendar days from the date of the action. Actions by the Council are final and no further administrative appeals are available.

B.      Filing an appeal. All appeals shall be submitted in writing, identifying the determination or action being appealed and specifically stating the basis or grounds of the appeal. Appeals shall be filed within 15 calendar days following the date of determination or action for which an appeal is made, accompanied by a filing fee established by Council resolution, and submitted to the City Clerk.

C.      Stay pending appeal. Timely filing of a written appeal shall automatically stay all actions and put in abeyance all approvals or permits that may have been granted, and neither the applicant nor any enforcing agency may rely upon the decision, approval, or denial or other action appeal, until the appeal has been resolved.

D.      Appeal hearing schedule.

1.       Unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant, an appeal for consideration by the Commission shall be scheduled for a public hearing by the Department within 40 days of the date of appeal filing.

2.       Unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant, an appeal for consideration by the Council shall be scheduled for a public hearing by the City Clerk within 40 days of the date of appeal filing.

E.       Notice of appeal hearings. Notice of hearing for the appeal shall be provided pursuant to noticing requirements of Section 25.60.060 (Public Hearing and Public Notice).

F.       Appeal hearing and action. Each appeal shall be considered a de novo (new) hearing. In taking its action on an appeal, the appeal authority shall state the basis for its action. The appeal authority may act to confirm, modify, reverse the action of the approving authority, in whole or in part, or add or amend such conditions as it deems necessary. The action of the appeal authority is final on the date of decision and, unless expressly provided by this chapter, may not be further appealed. Copies of the decision shall be mailed to the appellant and to the appealed deciding body. The decision of the Council shall be final.

G.      Review by Council. The Council retains ultimate jurisdiction and authority to determine whether any approval, denial or other decision rendered by the ZA, Director, ARC, or the Commission is consistent with the goal and policies established by the City and the requirements of this title. Any member of the Council may call up for review any approval, denial or other decision made pursuant to this title by delivery to the Director a request for review within 15 calendar days of the date of the decision, which will identify the decision to be reviewed and may, but is not required to, specify the concerns of the Councilperson with respect to the decision.

H.      Request for review is not an appeal. The Council request for review shall not constitute an appeal. A request for review is an indication only that a Councilperson considers the decision important enough to warrant review by the Council to ensure the decision is consistent with the goals and policies established by the City and the requirements of this title. The Councilperson who files a request for review need not take a position in favor or against the decision, and a request for review shall not be construed to be an indication of approval or disapproval of the decision. The filing of a request for review shall suspend any permit issued pursuant to the ruling of the ZA, Director, ARC, or the Commission until the request for review has been decided. (Ord. 1279 § 12, 2015; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.090 Effective Date
Generally, the action to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a permit or entitlement authorized by this title shall be effective on the 16th day after the date of action, immediately following expiration of the 15-day appeal period. Legislative actions by the Council involving adoption by ordinance (e.g., zoning code and map amendment, specific plan) become effective 30 days from the date of final action and may not be appealed. Permit(s) shall not be issued until the effective date of required permit. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.100 Land Use Permit Time Limits and Extensions
A.      Time limits. Unless a condition of approval or other provision of this title establishes a different time limit, any permit not exercised within one year of approval shall expire and become void, except where an extension of time is approved pursuant to this section.

B.      Exercising permits. The exercise of a permit occurs when the property owner has performed substantial work as determined by the Director and the building official and incurred substantial liabilities in good faith reliance upon such permit(s). A permit may be otherwise exercised pursuant to a condition of the permit or corresponding legal agreement that specifies that other substantial efforts or expenditures constitute exercise of the permit. Unless otherwise provided, permits that have not been exercised prior to a zoning amendment which would make the permitted use or structure nonconforming shall automatically be deemed invalid on the effective date of the zoning amendment.

C.      Permit extensions. The approval of an extension extends the expiration date for two years from the original permit date. After this initial permit extension, a final one-year extension of time may be granted pursuant to the same process as set forth in this section.

1.       Process. The same approving authority that granted the original permit may extend the period within which the exercise of a permit must occur. Notice and/or public hearing shall be provided in the same manner as for the original permit. An application for extension shall be filed not less than 30 days prior to the expiration date of the permit, along with appropriate fees and application submittal materials.

2.       Conditions. The permit, as extended, may be conditioned to comply with any development standards that may have been enacted since the permit was initially approved.

3.       Permit Extension Findings. The extension may be granted only when the designated approving authority finds that the original permit findings can still be made and there are no changed circumstances or there has been diligent pursuit to exercise the permit that warrants such extension.

4.       Expiration. If the time limits are reached with no extension requested, or a requested extension is denied or expires, the permit expires.

D.      Permit expiration for a closed business. All permits and entitlements shall expire when a business is closed for more than one calendar year. If a new business is established within the calendar year, all permits and entitlements received will remain valid. After one calendar year, the City may require the approval of new permits and entitlements based on current requirements shall be required prior to any business activity on the site. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.110 Modification
A.      Any person holding a permit granted under this title may request a modification or amendment to that permit. For the purpose of this section, the modification of a permit may include modification of the terms of the permit itself, project design, or the waiver or alteration of conditions imposed in the granting of the permit.

B.      Minor revisions or modifications may be approved by the Director if determined that the changes would not affect the findings prescribed in Section 25.72.050 (Conditional Use Permits) and the application for revision or modification is filed within one year from the date the original conditional use permit becomes final, does not change the use designated in the original conditional use permit, does not increase, reduce, or alter the size or shape of the premises to which the original conditional use permit pertained, and does not extend the time in which the actual establishment of the conditional use permit or the commencement of construction under the conditional use permit shall take place.

C.      If the Director determines that a proposed project action is not in substantial conformance with the original approval, the Director shall notify the property owner of the requirement to submit a permit modification application for consideration and action by the same approving authority as the original permit. A permit modification may be granted only when the approving authority makes all findings required for the original approval. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.120 Revocation
This section provides procedures for the revocation of previously approved land use entitlements or permits.

A.      Consideration. The approving authority for the original entitlement or permit shall consider the revocation of same entitlement or permit.

B.      Decision to revoke.

1.       The ZA may revoke a temporary use permit without a public hearing at the sole discretion of the ZA.

2.       The Director may revoke a home-based business permit and a certificate of use without a public hearing at his or her sole discretion.

3.       Except as specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, the decision to revoke an entitlement or permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this title shall be considered at a noticed public hearing by the review body that originally approved the permit. Public notice shall be provided and public hearing conducted pursuant to Section 25.60.060 (Public Hearing and Public Notice).

C.      Findings. A decision to revoke an entitlement or permit may be made if any one of the following findings can be made:

1.       Circumstances under which the entitlement or permit was granted have been changed to a degree that one or more of the findings contained in the original entitlement or permit can no longer be met.

2.       The entitlement or permit was issued, in whole or in part, on the basis of a misrepresentation or omission of a material statement in the application, or in the evidence presented during the public hearing, for the entitlement or permit.

3.       One or more of the conditions of the entitlement or permit have not been substantially fulfilled or have been violated.

4.       The use or structure for which the entitlement or permit was granted has ceased to exist or has lost its legal nonconforming use status.

5.       The improvement authorized in compliance with the entitlement or permit is in violation of any code, law, ordinance, regulation, or statute.

6.       The improvement or use allowed by the entitlement or permit has become detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or the manner of operation constitutes or is creating a public nuisance. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.60.130 Reapplications
A.      An application shall not be accepted or acted upon if within the past 12 months the City has denied an application for substantially the same project on substantially the same real property, unless the Director finds one or more of the following circumstances to exist:

1.       New Evidence. There is new evidence that would support approving the project that was not presented at the previous hearing and could not have been previously discovered in the exercise of reasonable diligence by the applicant.

25.60.150 Certificate of Use and Occupancy
A.      Purpose. In order to assure that each new or expanded use of a structure or site or alteration of an existing structure complies with all applicable provisions of this title, a use certificate is required before any building permit may be issued or any structure or site is used. A certificate of occupancy as required in the City building code shall be issued only for a structure that conforms to the use certificate.

B.      Application and issuance of use certificate. Applications for a use certificate shall be made on a form prescribed by the Commission and shall be accompanied by plans and additional information as necessary, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator (ZA), to demonstrate conformity with this title. The ZA shall check the application and all data submitted with it and shall issue a use certificate if he or she finds that all applicable provisions of this title will be complied with.

C.      Issuance of building permit. The building official shall not issue a building permit until the ZA has approved a use certificate for the structure which is the subject of the building permit.

D.      Issuance of certificate of occupancy. The building official shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for a structure or alteration until he or she has found that the structure or alteration conforms with the use certificate, until all required screening and landscaping and off-street parking and loading facilities are complete, and he or she has found that all conditions attached to a use permit, a variance, and design review have been met; provided, that the building official may issue a certificate of occupancy prior to the fulfillment of all requirements of this title if a faithful performance bond in an amount determined by the building official to be sufficient to complete the work necessary to meet the requirements is filed with the City. Cash in the amount of the faithful performance bond may be deposited with the City in lieu of the bond.

E.       Temporary certificate. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Building Official prior to the time that all of the requirements for a certificate of occupancy have been met; provided, that no permit other than a temporary permit shall be issued for gas or electric utilities until the Building Official determines that all of the requirements for a certificate of occupancy have been met. A temporary permit for gas or electric utilities shall be valid for 10 working days. If temporary permits for gas or electric utilities expire without the requirements for issuance of a certificate of occupancy having been met, the Building Official shall request the public utility to discontinue service.

F.       Determination of compliance with required conditions. If the ZA is unable to determine from information submitted by the applicant that a proposed use will comply with the required conditions for the district in which it is to be located, he or she shall not issue a use certificate, but shall, at his or her option, secure expert professional advice from firms or individuals acceptable to the City as well as the applicant. (Ord. 1293 § 1, 2015)

Chapter 25.62 NONCONFORMING PROVISIONS
25.62.010 Purpose
Where lots, buildings, or uses legally existing prior to the adoption of certain zoning provisions are not in conformity with the provisions of this title, it is the intent and purpose of this chapter to declare such lots, buildings, uses and land to be nonconforming, for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

A.      All nonconforming uses within any residential zone shall be terminated or made to conform within five years after the adoption of any new zoning regulations.

B.      Nonconforming buildings within a residential zone shall be permitted to expand providing the expanded area conforms to this title.

C.      A nonconforming lot may be developed if it has been legally created and the construction proposed is conforming. (Ord. 1279 § 13, 2015; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.62.030 Nonconforming Lots, Buildings, and Uses in Nonresidential Zones
A.      Nonconforming lots. A nonconforming lot may be developed if it has been legally created and the construction proposed is conforming.

B.      Nonconforming use of conforming building. The nonconforming use of a building may be continued, provided that such nonconforming use shall not be expanded or extended into any other portion of the conforming building, and if such nonconforming use is discontinued, any future use of such building shall conform to the provisions of this title.

C.      Nonconforming use of a nonconforming building. The nonconforming use of a nonconforming building may be continued but may not be expanded or extended within such building. If such nonconforming use is discontinued, any future use of such nonconforming building shall conform to the provisions of this title.

D.      Change in status of nonconforming use. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six months or is succeeded by another and conforming use, it is evidence that the nonconforming use has ended and any vested right to the continuance of such use is terminated.

E.       Change in status of nonconforming use. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six months or is succeeded by another and conforming use, it is evidence that the nonconforming use has ended and any vested right to the continuance of such use is terminated. (Ord. 1279 § 14, 2015; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.62.040 Reconstruction of Nonconforming Building Partially Destroyed
A nonconforming building that is destroyed to the extent of not more than 50 percent of its reasonable replacement value at the time of its destruction may be restored and the occupancy or use of such building or part thereof that existed at the time of such partial destruction may be continued subject to all other provisions of this title. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.62.050 Nonconforming Uses and Buildings Resulting from Reclassification
The provisions of Sections 25.62.010 through 25.62.040 shall apply to buildings, land, and uses that become nonconforming due to any reclassification of zones under this title. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.62.060 Outdoor Storage in Nonresidential Zones
Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the outdoor storage of materials and goods associated with a lawful use carried on within a building shall be permitted, provided that the outdoor storage is effectively screened from view by a wall, fence, or landscaping buffer complying with the height and setback restrictions of the zone in which it is located. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.62.070 Public Acquisition
Whenever any lot, any building, any structure, or any use is rendered nonconforming within the meaning of this title solely by dedication to, or purchase by, the city for any public purpose, or by eminent domain proceedings that result in the acquisition by the City of a portion of such property, the same shall not be deemed nonconforming within the meaning of this chapter; provided, however, that if subsequent to such acquisition, the buildings and/or structures located upon such a lot are wholly destroyed, no reconstruction shall take place unless compliance is had with all applicable provisions of this title. In the event, however, subsequent to such acquisition, the buildings and/or structures located upon such a lot are destroyed to the extent of not more than 50 percent of their reasonable replacement value, at the time of their destruction, the provisions of Section 25.62.040 of this chapter shall apply to any reconstruction of the buildings and/or structures. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.62.080 Conforming Process for Legal Nonconforming Residential Uses in Residential Zones and Office Professional Zones
Legal nonconforming residential uses in residential zones and OP zones may apply for legal conforming status if they are brought into substantial compliance with present design quality standards. The ARC shall receive and review applications for conforming status. As part of its review the ARC may require significant upgrading and rehabilitation of the existing facility consistent with the constraints of the original site plan. Reduction in the project dwelling unit total will only be considered if it is required to protect public health and safety. If a rehabilitation plan is approved by the ARC, required work must occur within one year. Once the plan has been satisfactorily completed, a certificate of conforming status will be issued. Certificates of conformance include a requirement that the project be maintained substantially in the condition specified by the rehabilitation plan, in perpetuity. Failure to maintain the property could result in revocation of conforming status. Decisions of the ARC may be appealed to the Council. (Ord. 1279 § 15, 2015; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.62.090 Notice of Nonconformity

C.      Method of service—Effective date of service. Service of the notice shall be made upon all persons entitled thereto, either personally, or by mailing a copy of such notice and order by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to each such person at his or her address as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll of the County or as known to the City. If no address of any such person so appears, or is known to the City, then a copy of the notice shall be so mailed, addressed to such person at the address of the lot or building involved in the proceedings. The failure of any such person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this section. Service by certified mail in the manner provided in this subsection shall be effective on the date of mailing.

D.      Proof of service. Proof of service of the notice shall be certified to at the time of service by written declaration, under penalty of perjury, executed by the persons effecting such service, declaring the time, date, and manner in which service was made.

11.     Any relevant evidence shall be admitted, if it is the type of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule, which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state.

Chapter 25.64 DECISIONS BY THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR
25.64.010 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for planning- and zoning-related permits that are decided by the designated Zoning Administrator (ZA). Each permit and entitlement type is described in this chapter in terms of purpose and applicability, approving authority, and unique processing provisions. General processing procedures are established in Chapter 25.60 (Procedures). Table 25.60-1 (Approving Authority for Land Use Permits/Entitlements) provides a summary of the administrative permits and entitlements decided by the ZA. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.64.020 Large Family Day Care Use Permits
A.      Purpose. Pursuant to California Health and Safety Code Section 1597.46, the City of Palm Desert prescribes reasonable land use standards, restrictions and requirements concerning space and concentration, traffic control, parking, and noise control relating to large family day care homes. A permit allows for the operation of a large family day care home in conformance with such standards, restrictions, and requirements. Its purpose is not to license, certify, or otherwise regulate the quality and safety of day care services provided by family day care homes and those who operate them, which are governed exclusively at the state level by the Department of Social Services.

B.      Application process. Applications for use permits to operate a large family day care home shall be made to the ZA or his or her designee, who shall specify the form of said applications consistent with this section. At a minimum, application forms shall indicate all of the following:

1.       Number of children to be cared for by the applicant, including the applicant’s own children less than 10 years of age.

2.       Number of employees.

3.       State license number.

4.       Proof that the applicant is in lawful possession and control of the real property proposed to be used as a large family day care home.

5.       In addition to submission of a completed application form as provided by this chapter, the applicant shall submit the following documentation:

i.        One copy of the assessor’s parcel map.

ii.       One copy of a site plan (8.5 by 11 inches) showing: location and dimension of existing residence and other structures, including permanent outdoor play structures and equipment, and fencing; distance to property line; parking areas and number of spaces both on-site and off-site; access to and exits from the home; floor(s) on which day care is to be provided; traffic circulation; and location of fire extinguishers and smoke detectors.

iii.     An accurate traffic circulation plan showing parking, circulation, and drop-off areas.

C.      Notice to property owners. Not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the decision will be made on the application, the ZA or his or her designee shall give notice of the proposed use by mail or delivery to all owners shown on the last equalized assessment roll as owning real property within a 300-foot radius of the exterior boundaries of the proposed large family day care home. A copy of the notice shall also be sent to the applicant. The notice shall inform its recipient that no hearing shall be held before a decision on the application unless requested by the recipient.

D.      Decision by the Zoning Administrator. After proper notice has been given to affected property owners, the ZA or his or her designee shall render a decision on the application. Unless requested by the applicant or other affected person, no hearing shall be held on the application before a decision is made. The application shall be approved if all of the following standards and requirements are met:

1.       Space and Concentration. Properties proposed for use as large family day care homes shall be located no closer than 300 feet in all directions from another large family day care home, subject to an application for an exception to said 300-foot distance which may, after a public hearing and notice to the adjacent property owners in accordance with this chapter, cause the reduction to no more than 100 feet from another large family day care home. The foregoing spacing and concentration requirements shall not apply to large family day care homes which are already operating in the City on the date this chapter takes effect.

2.       Traffic Control. The traffic circulation plan shall be designed to diminish traffic safety problems. Residences located on major arterial streets (as shown on the General Plan circulation map) must provide a drop-off/pickup area designed to prevent vehicles from backing onto the arterial roadway. The applicant may be required to submit a plan of staggered drop-off and pickup time ranges to reduce congestion in neighborhoods already identified as having traffic congestion problems.

3.       Parking. All homes used for large family day care facilities shall provide at least three automobile parking spaces, no more than one of which may be provided in a garage or carport. Parking may be on-street if contiguous to property. These may include spaces already provided to fulfill residential parking requirements.

4.       Noise Control. Operation of the facility shall comply with all provisions of Chapter 9.24 of this code. Additional conditions may be placed on use permits to reduce noise impact if ongoing problems exist.

5.       Signage. No signs or other exterior markings identifying a large family day care operation shall be allowed on the applicant’s home.

6.       Residency. The applicant must be a primary resident of the home that is proposed as a large family day care home.

7.       Contact Person. The current name(s) and telephone number(s) of the applicant, and all other operators if different from the applicant, of the family day care home shall be on file with the department of community development at all times.

8.       State Licensing. All appropriate licensing from the state Department of Social Services shall be obtained prior to commencing operation of any large family day care home in the City.

9.       Building and Fire Code Compliance. Consistent with Section 1597.46 of the Health and Safety Code, the proposed large family day care home must comply with all building and fire code provisions applicable to single-family residences, and with such additional standards as the State Fire Marshal from time to time adopts pursuant to Section 1597.46(d) of the Health and Safety Code to promote the fire and life safety of children in family day care homes. (See Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations.) No application shall be approved unless and until the City’s building inspector and fire marshal, or their designees, have first inspected the premises and approved that the home does comply with the foregoing building and fire code provisions. However, a copy of the applicable state licensing evaluation report covering these issues may be found by the City staff to be sufficient.

10.     Smoking Restricted. Consistent with Section 1596.795 of the Health and Safety Code, smoking of tobacco and other substances—whether in pipe, cigar, or cigarette form—shall not be allowed in the applicant’s home during its hours of operation as a large family day care home with respect to those areas of the home where children are present.

11.     Single-Family Zoning. No use permit shall be issued unless the dwelling unit proposed to be used as a large family day care home is located on a lot zoned or used for single-family dwellings under this chapter.

12.     Proof of Control. No use permit shall be issued unless the applicant can demonstrate legal authority and control over the real property proposed to be used as a large family day care home.

E.       Appeal of decision. The applicant or other affected person may appeal the decision to grant or deny an application for a use permit pursuant to this chapter to the Commission. The Commission’s decision shall be final unless the matter is called up for review by the Council within 15 calendar days of the Commission’s decision. The appellant shall pay the City’s costs, if any, of processing and conducting the appeal. The amount of such costs shall be estimated in advance by the ZA or designee and the appellant shall deposit said amount with the City before the City will process the request for an appeal. If at the end of the appeal the City’s actual costs were less than the estimate, then the City shall refund the unused portion of the deposit to the appellant. In the event that the City’s costs exceeded the amount of the deposit, then the appellant shall pay the amount of the difference to the City.

F.       Expiration of permit. If a large family day care home possessing a use permit ceases to operate for a period greater than 365 consecutive days or its state license expires, whichever occurs first, and then its use permit shall be considered null and void. Permits are nontransferable.

G.      Review of permit—Suspension or revocation.

1.       Upon determination that the holder of a large family day care home use permit has not complied with all of the standards and requirements of this chapter, the ZA may require the use permit to be reviewed by the Commission at a public hearing. A noticed public hearing to review the use permit is mandatory when the City receives six substantiated complaints alleging violations of this chapter.

2.       If the Commission determines that the holder has failed in a material way to comply with all of the stan-dards and requirements of this chapter, then the Commission may suspend or revoke the permit or may, in its discretion, impose additional reasonable standards and requirements consistent with state law, based on findings derived from testimony and evidence presented at the public hearing.

H.      New applications. Following the denial of a large family day care use permit application or the revocation of a large family day care permit, no application for a large family day care use permit for the same or substantially the same business on the same or substantially the same site shall be filed within one year from the date of denial or revocation of the large family day care use permit. (Ord. 1279 §§ 16—19, 2015; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.64.030 Adjustments
A.      Purpose.

1.       Adjustments shall be granted only when, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of this title deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification. Any adjustment granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and district in which such property is situated.

2.       The power to grant adjustments does not extend to use regulations. Flexibility to the zoning regulations is provided in the conditional use provisions of this title.

B.      Application—Submittal requirements. Application for an adjustment shall be filed with the Department on a form, and include application materials prescribed by the ZA.

C.      Permissible adjustments. Deviations from the following development standards may be permitted with approval of an adjustment:

1.       A decrease of not more than 10 percent of the building lot coverage or width.

2.       A decrease of not more than 20 percent of the required width of a side yard or the yard between buildings.

3.       A decrease of not more than 40 percent of the required rear yard.

4.       A decrease of not more than 40 percent of the distance required between the front property line and the building line.

5.       A decrease of not more than 10 percent of the required parking spaces.

6.       An increase of not more than 10 percent of the permitted projection of steps, stairways, landings, eaves, overhangs, masonry chimneys, and fireplaces, into any required front, rear, side or yard between buildings.

7.       Other deviations from the zoning regulations may be considered by the Commission through the variance procedure (Section 25.72.070).

D.      Public hearing. No public hearing is required for the consideration of an adjustment application.

E.       Action of the Zoning Administrator. The ZA may grant an adjustment as the adjustment was applied for or in modified form, or the application may be denied. An adjustment may be granted for a limited time period, or may be granted subject to conditions as the ZA may prescribe.

F.       Findings. The ZA may grant an adjustment to a regulation prescribed by this title if, on the basis of the evidence submitted, the ZA makes the following findings of fact:

1.       That strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship inconsistent with the objectives of the ordinance codified in this title.

2.       That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zone.

3.       That strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by the owners of other properties in the same vicinity and zone.

4.       That the granting of the adjustment will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.

G.      Effective date. A decision of the ZA shall be effective 15 days after the date of the decision unless an appeal has been issued. An adjustment shall become effective immediately after it is granted by the ZA.

H.      Lapse of adjustment. An adjustment shall lapse and shall become void one year following the date on which the adjustment became effective unless prior to the expiration of one year a building permit is issued and construction is commenced and diligently pursued toward completion on the site which was the subject of the adjustment application, or a permit is issued authorizing occupancy of the site or structure which was the subject of the adjustment application, or the site is occupied if no building permit or certificate of occupancy is required. Prior to the expiration of a permit, an applicant may request a 12-month time extension by filing with the ZA.

I.        Revocation. An adjustment granted by the ZA subject to conditions shall be revoked by the ZA if the applicant has not complied with the conditions. The decision of the ZA revoking an adjustment shall become effective 15 days following the date on which it was revoked unless an appeal has been filed. An adjustment granted by the Council shall be revoked only by the Council.

J.       New application. Following the denial or revocation of an adjustment application, no application for the same or substantially the same adjustment on the same or substantially the same site shall be filed within one year of the date of denial or revocation of the adjustment.

K.      Adjustment related to plans submitted. Unless otherwise specified at the time an adjustment is granted, it shall apply only to the plans and drawings submitted as part of the application. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.64.040 Administrative Use Permits
A.      Purpose. Administrative use permits allow for approval of uses and activities whose effects on adjacent sites and surroundings need to be evaluated in terms of a specific development proposal. It is anticipated that uses qualifying for an administrative use review are minor in nature, only have an impact on immediately adjacent properties, and can be modified and/or conditioned to ensure compatibility.

B.      Applicability. This section applies to land use requiring an administrative use review as designated with an “A” on the allowed use tables, including Table 25.10-1 (Use Matrix for Residential Districts), and Table 25.16-1 (Use Matrix for Commercial and Industrial Districts).

C.      Review process. The ZA is the approving authority for administrative use permits. However, the ZA may refer an administrative use permit to the Commission for review and approval.

1.       Public notice of the application submittal and pending determination shall be made in accordance with Section 25.60.060.C (notice of Zoning Administrator decision).

2.       ZA determination shall be based on standards and criteria set forth within this code and shall be accompanied by brief, written findings and a determination.

D.      Findings. The ZA shall approve, or approve with conditions, an application for an administrative use permit after making all of the findings below. If the ZA does not make all of these findings, he/she shall deny the administrative use permit.

1.       The proposed use is allowed within the applicable zoning district and complies with all other applicable provisions of this zoning code, municipal code, General Plan, and any applicable specific plans or City regulations/standards.

2.       The site is physically suited for the type, density, and intensity of the proposed use, including access, utilities, and the absence of physical constraints, and can be conditioned to meet all related performance criteria and development standards.

3.       Granting the permit would not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, convenience, or welfare, or materially injurious to persons, property, or improvements in the vicinity in which the project is located.

E.       Conditions. In approving an administrative use review, the ZA may impose any reasonable conditions to ensure that the approval will comply with the findings required, as well as any performance criteria and development standards contained within this code. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.64.050 Reasonable Accommodation
A.      Purpose. In accordance with federal and state fair housing laws, it is the purpose of this section to allow for reasonable accommodations in the City’s zoning and land use regulations, policies, and practices when needed to provide an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.

B.      Application.

1.       Applicant. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, their representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with a disability. A reasonable accommodation may be approved only for the benefit of one or more individuals with a disability.

2.       Application. An application for a reasonable accommodation from a zoning regulation, policy, or practice shall be made on a form specified by the ZA. No fee shall be required for a request for reasonable accommodation, but if the project requires another discretionary permit, then the prescribed fee shall be paid for all other discretionary permits.

3.       Other Discretionary Permits. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is made requires another discretionary permit or approval, then the applicant may file the request for reasonable accommodation together with the application for the other discretionary permit or approval. The processing procedures of the discretionary permit shall govern the joint processing of both the reasonable accommodation and the discretionary permit.

4.       Required Submittals. In addition to materials required under other applicable provisions of this code, an application for reasonable accommodation shall include the following:

i.        Documentation that the applicant is: (a) an individual with a disability; (b) applying on behalf of one or more individuals with a disability; or (c) a developer or provider of housing for one or more individuals with a disability.

ii.       The specific exception or modification to the zoning code provision, policy, or practices requested by the applicant.

iii.     Documentation that the specific exception or modification requested by the applicant is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the residence.

iv.      Any other information that the ZA reasonably concludes is necessary to make a determination on a reasonable accommodation request, so long as any request for information regarding the disability of the individuals benefited complies with fair housing law protections and the privacy rights of the individuals affected.

C.      Review procedure. The ZA is designated approval authority for reasonable accommodation requests and shall approve a reasonable accommodation request if the compliance requirements below are addressed.

D.      Required findings. The written decision to approve a request for reasonable accommodation shall be based on the following findings, all of which are required for approval:

1.       The requested accommodation is requested by or on behalf of one or more individuals with a disability protected under the fair housing laws.

2.       The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.

3.       The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City as “undue financial or administrative burden” is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law.

4.       The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the City’s zoning program, as “fundamental alteration” is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law.

5.       The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or substantial physical damage to the property of others.

E.       Alternative reasonable accommodations. The decision-maker may approve alternative reasonable accommodations that provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant.

F.       Consideration factors. The City may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling:

1.       Whether the requested accommodation will affirmatively enhance the quality of life of one or more individuals with a disability.

2.       Whether the individual or individuals with a disability will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing type of their choice absent the accommodation.

3.       In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make facilities of a similar nature or operation economically viable in light of the particularities of the relevant market and market participants.

4.       In the case of a residential care facility, whether the existing supply of facilities of a similar nature and operation in the community is sufficient to provide individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to live in a residential setting.

G.      Consideration factors—Fundamental alteration to zoning program. The City may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the City’s zoning program:

1.       Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the character of the neighborhood.

2.       Whether the requested accommodation would result in a substantial increase in traffic or insufficient parking.

3.       Whether the requested accommodation would substantially undermine any express purpose of either the City’s General Plan or an applicable specific plan.

4.       In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation would create an institutionalized environment due to the number of and distance between facilities that are similar in nature or operation.

H.      Rules while decision is pending. While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect.

I.        Effective date. No reasonable accommodation shall become effective until the decision to grant such accommodation shall have become final by reason of the expiration of time to make an appeal. In the event an appeal is filed, the reasonable accommodation shall not become effective unless and until a decision is made by the Council on such appeal, pursuant to the provisions of this section.

J.       Expiration. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this chapter shall expire within 24 months from the effective date of approval or at an alternative time specified as a condition of approval unless one of the following applies:

1.       A building permit has been issued and construction has commenced.

2.       A certificate of occupancy has been issued.

3.       The use is established.

4.       A time extension has been granted.

K.      Time extension. The ZA may approve a single one-year time extension for a reasonable accommodation for good cause. An application for a time extension shall be made in writing to the ZA no less than 30 days or more than 90 days prior to the expiration date. The request for an extension shall be subject to the same notice, hearing, and appeal requirements applicable to the original application.

L.       Violation of terms. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this code may be revoked if any of the conditions or terms of such reasonable accommodation are violated, or if any law or ordinance is violated in connection therewith. Revocation of a reasonable accommodation shall be subject to the same notice, hearing, and appeal requirements applicable to the original application.

M.     Discontinuance. A reasonable accommodation shall lapse if the exercise of rights granted by it is discontinued for 180 consecutive days. If the persons initially occupying a residence vacate, the reasonable accommodation shall remain in effect only if the ZA determines that: (1) the modification is physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered to comply with the zoning code, or (2) the accommodation is necessary to give another disabled individual an equal opportunity to enjoy the dwelling. The ZA may request the applicant or his or her successor in interest to the property to provide documentation that subsequent occupants are persons with disabilities. Failure to provide such documentation within 10 days of the date of a request by the City shall constitute grounds for discontinuance by the City of a previously approved reasonable accommodation.

N.      Revocation. Any revocation shall be noticed and heard pursuant to the procedures established in this title.

O.      Amendments. A request for changes in conditions of approval of a reasonable accommodation, or a change to plans that would affect a condition of approval shall be treated as a new application. The ZA may waive the requirement for a new application if the changes are minor, do not involve substantial alterations or additions to the plan or the conditions of approval, and are consistent with the intent of the original approval. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

Chapter 25.68 DECISIONS BY THE ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW COMMISSION
25.68.010 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish permits and entitlements that are decided by the Architectural Review Commission (ARC). Each permit and entitlement type is described in this chapter in terms of purpose and applicability, unique review process, findings for approval, and conditions. General processing procedures are established in Chapter 25.60 (Procedures). (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.68.020 Design Review Required
Purpose and applicability. Design review allows for specified projects to be reviewed by the ARC to ensure that design objectives of Palm Desert as specified in the General Plan are achieved. Design review is required, as follows:

A.      Prior to permit issuance. No plan, elevation for buildings or structures, or alterations shall be approved and no permit shall be issued for any building, structure, sign, or other development of property or appurtenances or alterations thereto, except in single-family residential districts, without review and approval by the ARC.

B.      The ARC shall review all plans submitted with applications for moving buildings within or into the City. Photographs shall be included with the application showing all elevations, the structure proposed to be moved, the proposed site, and the buildings adjacent to the proposed site. The ARC shall determine whether the building proposed to be moved will fit harmoniously into the neighborhood wherein it is to be located. It may approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the issuance of a permit to move such building. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.68.030 Exceptions to ARC review
A.      Minor modifications. When in the opinion of the ZA, the approval of an application for a minor or insignificant permit does not defeat the purposes and objectives of this chapter, he or she may grant the permit without submitting the matter to the ARC for its approval, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter.

B.      Staff’s review of a single-family residence. Department staff shall review applications for the issuance of a building permit for a dwelling in the single-family and residential estate zones. The staff, on its own initiative, may forward such a request to the ARC for action. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.68.040 Findings of the ARC
To approve a design review application, the ARC shall find the following:

A.      That the proposed development conforms to any legally adopted development standards.

B.      That the design and location of the proposed development and its relationship to neighboring existing or proposed developments and traffic is such that it will not impair the desirability of investment or occupation in the neighborhood; and that it will not unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighboring existing or proposed developments and that it will not create traffic hazards or congestion.

C.      That the design and location of the proposed development is in keeping with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and is not detrimental to the harmonious, orderly, and attractive development contemplated by this title and the General Plan of the City.

D.      That the design and location of the proposed development would provide a desirable environment for its occupants, as well as for its neighbors and that it is aesthetically of good composition, materials, textures, and colors.

E.       That the proposed use conforms to all the requirements of the zone in which it is located and all other applicable requirements.

F.       That the overall development of the land shall be designed to ensure the protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.68.050 Sign Design Review
A.      Application contents. Applications for sign design review shall be made on a form provided by the Department and shall be accompanied by a fee as established by Council resolution. The application shall provide the information and material specified in the Department’s handout for a sign permit application. The applicant shall also provide a signed statement from the property owner or authorized representative that the owner or representative has reviewed the proposed sign(s) and approves of the proposed sign(s) and their location prior to submittal of the sign permit application to the City.

B.      Minor signs. The ZA shall be authorized to conduct and approve sign design reviews for signs not described in subsection C of this section. The decision of the ZA shall be subject to appeal made to the ARC.

C.      Design review required. The following sign types and sign programs shall be submitted to the ARC for approval prior to approval of a sign permit application:

1.       Freestanding signs (monument signs).

2.       All new awnings, including color change to existing awnings (awning signs).

3.       Comprehensive sign programs in compliance with Section 25.56.100 (Comprehensive Sign Programs).

4.       Individual signs for any building with more than 100 lineal feet of building frontage facing a public or private right-of-way.

5.       Any sign that the ZA determines should be reviewed by the ARC due to the unique design, context, color, size, shape, location, or circumstance of the sign.

D.      Sign review criteria. In approving or rejecting a sign permit application, the reviewing authority shall consider the design review criteria provided herein. The design criteria shall not be construed or applied in a manner as to violate any legal rights bestowed by state or federal law. The reviewing authority shall find:

1.       That the sign is necessary for the applicant’s enjoyment of substantial trade and property rights.

2.       That the sign is consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter and title.

3.       That the sign does not constitute a detriment to public health, safety, and welfare.

4.       That the size, shape, color, height, and placement of the sign is compatible with and will have a harmonious relationship to the building it identifies, the surrounding neighborhoods, and other signs in the area.

5.       That both the location of the proposed sign and the design of its visual elements (lettering, words, figures, colors, decorative motifs, spacing, and proportions) are legible under normal viewing conditions prevailing where the sign is to be located.

6.       That the location, height, and design of the proposed sign does not obscure from view or unduly detract from existing or adjacent signs, and does not in any way compromise the health or safety of any person(s).

7.       That the location and design of the proposed sign, and its size, shape, illumination, and color are compatible with the visual characteristics of the surrounding area so as not to detract from or cause depreciation of the value of adjacent developed properties.

8.       That the location and design of a proposed sign in close proximity to a residential district does not adversely affect the value or character of the adjacent residential uses.

9.       That any neon tubing used in conjunction with any sign is incorporated as an integral part of the sign design with careful attention to color, intensity of light, and the use of colors that are not overly bright.

10.     That the quantity of information displayed in the sign does not cause visual clutter. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.68.060 Comprehensive Sign Programs
A.      Purpose. The purpose of a comprehensive sign program is to integrate all of a nonresidential project’s signs with the overall site design and the structures’ design into a unified architectural statement. A comprehensive sign program provides a means for the flexible application of sign regulations in order to provide incentive and latitude in the design and display of multiple signs and to achieve, not circumvent, the purpose of this chapter. Approval of a comprehensive sign program may modify the standards provided in this chapter as to sign number, size, height, illumination, location, orientation, or other aspects of signs within the limits of this section.

B.      Applicability. The approval of a comprehensive sign program shall be required whenever any of the following circumstances exist:

1.       Whenever three or more separate tenant spaces are present on the same site.

2.       Whenever three or more nonexempt signs are proposed for a single tenant.

3.       Whenever signs are proposed to be located on the second story on a multistory building.

4.       Whenever an existing multitenant development of three or more tenants is being remodeled or rehabilitated to the extent that it requires review and approval by the ARC.

5.       Whenever the Director determines that a comprehensive sign program is needed because of special project characteristics (e.g., the size of proposed signs, limited site visibility, the location of the site relative to other lots, buildings, or streets, etc.).

C.      Approval authority and procedures. The ARC shall be the review authority for a comprehensive sign program as described in Section 25.56.100. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

Chapter 25.72 DECISIONS BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION
25.72.010 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish permits and entitlements that are decided by the Planning Commission (Commission). Each permit and entitlement type is described in this chapter in terms of purpose and applicability, unique review process, findings for approval, and conditions. General processing procedures are established in Chapter 25.60 (Procedures). (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.72.020 Use Determinations
A.      Purpose. In order to ensure that the zoning regulations will permit all similar uses in each district, the Commission, upon its own initiative or upon request, shall determine whether a use not specifically listed as a permitted or conditional use in any district shall be deemed a permitted use or a conditional use in any one or more districts on the basis of similarity to uses specifically listed. The procedures of this chapter shall not be substituted for the amendment procedure as a means of adding new uses to the list of permitted or conditional uses.

B.      Application—Submittal requirements. Application for determination of similar uses shall be made in writing to the Director and shall include a detailed description of the proposed use and such other information as may be required to facilitate the determination.

C.      Investigation and report. The Director shall make such investigation of the application as necessary to compare the nature and characteristics of the proposed use with those uses specifically listed and shall make a report of his or her findings to the Commission.

D.      Determination. The determination of the Commission shall be rendered in writing and shall be transmitted to the Council within 15 days of the determination. The decision of the Commission shall become final within 30 days unless an appeal is filed or the majority of the Council elects to review the determination.

E.       Determination by City Council. If required, the Council shall make a determination as prescribed in Section 25.60.080 (Appeals). (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.72.030 Precise Plan
A.      Purpose. A precise plan allows for the review of uses, sites, and structures to ensure that the applicable design and development standards are implemented as intended.

B.      Applicability. A precise plan is required as follows:

1.       No person shall commence any use for which a conditional use permit is required or any use not permitted in either the R-1 or RE zone. No building permit shall be issued for any structure to be used for, or in conjunction with any such use, until a precise plan of design covering the parcel or parcels to be so used shall be approved and adopted as provided in this chapter.

2.       Notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Building Code, no grading permit shall be issued for the grading or excavation of any land, until a precise plan of design, tentative tract map, or tentative parcel map covering the property proposed to be graded or excavated has been approved and adopted as provided in this chapter.

C.      Exceptions. This subsection shall not apply to the grading or excavation required in connection with:

1.       The construction of a swimming pool on property in the residential zone.

2.       The movement of less than 50 cubic yards of earth.

3.       The grading of any parcel of property outside of the hillside overlay zone so as to improve the land for emergency drainage purposes.

D.      Application requirements. The applications for a precise plan shall be submitted on a form as provided by the Director and include submittal materials as required.

E.       Review criteria. Any such precise plan of design may be rejected, approved, modified and approved, or approved subject to conditions. Any such precise plan of design after approval may be amended, in the same manner as a precise plan of design is first approved under this chapter. The following criteria apply:

1.       In the approval or rejection of a precise plan of design, consideration shall be given and restrictions shall be imposed to the extent necessary, in view of the size and shape of the parcel and the present and proposed zoning and use of the subject property and the surrounding property, to permit the same degree of enjoyment of the subject property, but subject to the same degree of protection of adjoining properties, as would be accorded in normal circumstances by the standard restrictions imposed by this chapter. The standard restrictions imposed in the various zones by this chapter are intended as minimum restrictions necessary in normal circumstances to prevent substantial depreciation of property values in the vicinity and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of property in the vicinity by the occupants thereof for lawful purposes, and for the protection of the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare. “Normal circumstances” are intended to refer to the case of a permitted case upon a lot of a normal size and shape surrounded by property in the same zone as the lot in question.

2.       If the proposed precise plan of design would substantially depreciate property values in the vicinity or would unreasonably interfere with the use or enjoyment of property in the vicinity by the occupants thereof for lawful purposes or would endanger the public peace, health, safety, or general welfare, such plan shall be rejected or shall be so modified or conditioned before adoption as to remove said objections.

3.       If required, the design review approval by the ARC (Section 25.68.020, Design Review Required) must be obtained prior to the precise plan review by the Commission.

F.       Approval subject to condition. A precise plan of design may be approved subject to the granting of a change of zone, a conditional use permit, a variance, or the approval of a final subdivision map, and the Commission or Council may require such a precise plan of design to be submitted prior to the granting or recommending of a zone change, variance, or conditional use permit.

G.      Compliance required. No person shall violate or fail to comply with any approved precise plan of design or any conditions or provisions thereof nor shall a building permit be issued for any structure which would violate or fail to comply with any approved precise plan of design for the parcel or parcels on which such structure is to be located. In the event any such permit is issued, it shall be null and void and have no further effect.

H.      Continuance of existing plans. Any precise plan previously approved and in effect shall remain in effect regardless of any changes to zoning regulations subsequently adopted, unless the precise plans are made null and void or amended at the time of adoption.

I.        Distinction from other precise plans. The precise plans of design referred to in this chapter are not to be confused with or considered to be precise plans as referred to in the Government Code of the State.

J.       Street frontage requirements. No building or other structure to be used for any business or commercial purpose shall hereafter be erected unless the frontage of the lot, or parcel of land upon which such building or structure is erected, abuts on one side of a public street, unless an unnecessary hardship would result as determined by the Commission.

K.      Failure to utilize a precise plan.

1.       Failure to utilize a precise plan within one year of its effective date (unless extended by action of the Commission) will automatically void such precise plan. In the event construction work is involved, such work must actually commence within the stated period and be diligently pursued.

2.       Extension of time up to a maximum one year may be granted from the date of expiration of the precise plan by the Commission when extenuating circumstances can be clearly shown by the applicant. The request for same shall be submitted to the Commission in writing prior to the expiration date and shall clearly state the reasons why construction has not commenced.

3.       The Commission may grant additional time extensions providing that there has not been adopted any changes to zoning regulations that would impact said precise plan.

L.       Amendment to a precise plan.

1.       The Commission may grant an amendment to the approved precise plan only after all procedures as set forth in the original application are met except that the request for such amendment may be in letter form in lieu of being placed on the official form of application for a precise plan of design.

2.       The Director may approve in writing on the approved precise plan minor modifications without the benefit of public hearing when such modifications do not adversely affect the public interest or the interest of owners of neighboring properties or substantially alter the plan, and so long as the modification would not affect any other condition of approval. (Ord. 1292 § 2, 2015; Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.72.050 Conditional Use Permit
A.      Purpose. In order to give the use regulations the flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives of this title, in certain districts, conditional uses are permitted, subject to the granting of a conditional use permit. Because of their unusual characteristics, conditional uses require special consideration so that they may be located properly with respect to the objectives of the zoning regulations and with respect to their effects on surrounding properties. In order to achieve these purposes, the Commission is empowered to grant or deny applications for conditional use permits for such conditional uses as are prescribed in the district regulations and to impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of conditional use permits subject to the right of appeal to the Council.

B.      Application requirements. Application for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the Department on a form prescribed by the Director and shall include materials as required.

C.      Investigation and report. The Department shall make an investigation of the application and shall prepare a report thereon which shall be submitted to the Commission and made available to the applicant prior to the public hearing.

D.      Hearings. The Commission shall hold at least one public hearing on each application for a conditional use permit. The hearing shall be set and notice given as prescribed in Section 25.60.060 (Public Hearing and Public Notice). At the public hearing, the Commission shall review the application and drawings submitted therewith and shall receive pertinent evidence concerning the proposed use and proposed conditions under which it would be operated or maintained.

E.       Action of the Commission. The Commission may grant a conditional use permit as the permit was applied for or in modified form, or the application may be denied. A conditional use permit may be granted for a limited time period, or may be granted subject to such conditions as the Commission may prescribe. Conditions may include, but shall not be limited to, payment of drainage fees; requiring special yards, open spaces, buffers, fences, and walls; requiring installation and maintenance of landscaping; requiring street dedications and improvements; regulation of points of vehicular ingress and egress; regulation of traffic circulation; regulation of signs; regulation of hours of operation and methods of operation; control of potential nuisances; prescribing standards for maintenance of buildings and grounds; prescription of development schedules and development standards; and such other conditions as the Commission deems necessary to ensure compatibility of the use with surrounding developments and uses and to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare.

F.       Findings. The Commission shall make the following findings before granting a conditional use permit:

1.       That the proposed location of the conditional use is in accord with the objectives of this title and the purpose of the district in which the site is located.

2.       That the proposed location of the conditional use and the conditions under which it would be operated or maintained will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or be materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.

3.       That the proposed conditional use will comply with each of the applicable provisions of this title, except for approved variances or adjustments.

4.       That the proposed conditional use complies with the goals, objectives, and policies of the City’s General Plan.

G.      Effective date of the use permit. The decision of the Commission shall be final within 15 days from the date of the decision unless an appeal has been filed with the Council.

H.      Lapse of conditional use permit. A conditional use permit shall lapse and shall become void one year following the date on which the use permit became effective, unless prior to the expiration of one year a building permit is issued and construction is commenced and diligently pursued toward completion on the site which was the subject of the use permit application, or a certificate of occupancy is issued for the structure which was the subject of the use permit application, or the site is occupied if no building permit or certificate of occupancy is required; provided that a use permit for a public utility installation may be valid for a longer period is specified by the Commission. Prior to the expiration of the permit, the applicant may request a one year time extension by filing with the Commission.

I.        Modification of conditional use. Modification, expansion, or other change in a conditional use; provided, that minor revisions or modifications may be approved by the Director if he or she determines that the changes would not affect the findings prescribed in Section 25.72.050.F (Findings), and the application for revision or modification is filed within one year from the date the original conditional use permit becomes final, does not change the use designated in the original conditional use permit, does not increase, reduce, or alter the size or shape of the premises to which the original conditional use permit pertained, and does not extend the time in which the actual establishment of the conditional use permit or the commencement of construction under the conditional use permit shall take place.

J.       Suspension and revocation. Any conditional use permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this title may be modified, discontinued, suspended or revoked by the Commission upon receiving satisfactory evidence that the permittee, its agent(s), employee(s), or any person connected or associated with the permittee: (1) has failed to comply with any applicable provision of the Palm Desert Municipal Code, including but not limited to the City’s building, zoning, and health regulations; (2) has failed to comply with any condition imposed by the conditional use permit; or (3) has allowed the existence of or created a public nuisance in violation of the Palm Desert Municipal Code. The modification, discontinuance, suspension, or revocation shall be made only after a duly noticed hearing before the Commission, which hearing shall be conducted within 40 days of learning of the violation.

K.      Commission determination.

1.       Not more than 30 days or less than 10 days prior to the hearing, written notice of the time and place of hearing shall be given to the permittee. The notice shall specify in general terms the grounds upon which the Commission intends to modify, discontinue, suspend, or revoke the conditional use permit. The notice shall be deemed complete when delivered to the permittee by personal service, when sent by certified mail to the permittee’s last known address, or when posted in a conspicuous place on the property for which the conditional use permit was issued.

2.       Notice of the hearing shall also be mailed not more than 30 days or less than 10 days prior to the hearing to all persons whose names appear on the latest adopted tax roll of Riverside County as owning property within 300 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property subject to the hearing and all persons who have filed written complaints with the City regarding the subject property.

3.       After giving notice and conducting the hearing, the Commission may modify, discontinue, suspend, or revoke the conditional use permit. As part of any such action, the Commission may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate, including those necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding property to the neighborhood; to eliminate, lessen, or prevent any detrimental effect thereon; or to assure compliance with other applicable provisions of the law. Any such action shall be supported by written findings, including a finding that it does not impair the constitutional rights of any person.

4.       The decision of the Commission shall become final 30 days following the date on which the conditional use permit was suspended or revoked unless an appeal has been filed with the Council in accordance with Section 25.60.080 (Appeals) of this code.

L.       New applications. Following the denial of a conditional use permit application or the revocation of a conditional use permit, no application for a conditional use permit for the same or substantially the same conditional use on the same or substantially the same site shall be filed within one year from the date of denial or revocation of the conditional use permit.

M.     Use permit to run with the land. A conditional use permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall run with the land, and shall continue to be valid upon a change of ownership of the site or structure which was the subject of the conditional use permit application. However, the City shall be notified of any change of ownership within 90 days of its occurrence. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.72.060 Condominium Conversion Permit
A.      Purpose and intent. This section provides standards and criteria for regulating the conversion of rental housing to residential condominium units or rental housing to a condominium hotel, community apartment, or stock cooperative types of ownership and for determining when such conversions are appropriate; mitigates any hardship to tenants caused by their displacement; and provides provisions to protect public health, safety, and general welfare.

B.      Applicable standards. The Commission/Council is the review authority for condominium conversion projects. All condominium conversion projects shall conform to: (1) the applicable standards and requirements of the zoning district in which the project is located at the time of approval; (2) Section 25.34.050 of the Palm Desert Municipal Code; and (3) all other applicable local, state, and/or federal laws and codes.

C.      Findings—Condominium conversion projects. The Commission/Council shall not approve a condominium conversion permit for same unless it finds all of the following:

1.       The condominium conversion project is consistent with the applicable findings specified in Section 25.72.050 (Conditional Use Permits) of this code.

2.       That the applicant does not seek to convert an apartment complex or development, which received a certificate of occupancy for any unit, located therein within the preceding 12 months.

3.       That the average rental vacancy rate in apartment dwelling units within the city during the 24 months proceeding the filing of the application is equal to or greater than 5 percent. Upon submission of the application, the City Manager or designee shall obtain, at applicant’s sole expense, a written study or report from an objective, unbiased third party which provides such studies and/or reports as part of its ordinary course and scope of business on a statewide or nationwide basis, which, in the reasonable opinion of the City Manager or designee, reflects that the average rental vacancy rate in apartment units then available in the city is 5 percent or higher. If the average rental vacancy rate in the city during the 24 months preceding the filing of the application is less than 5 percent or if as a result of the approval of said condominium conversion the vacancy rate would be less than 5 percent, the condominium conversion project shall be denied unless the Commission/Council determines that at least one of the following overriding considerations exist:

i.        Evidence has been submitted that at least 50 percent plus one of the eligible tenants has voted to recommend approval of the conversion.

ii.       That the evidence presented to the Commission/Council as part of the application for the project overwhelmingly complies with the policies and intent of this chapter. Applicants shall be able to request that the Commission/Council allow for a condominium conversion project to be considered for approval where the vacancy rate and/or tenant approval percentage requirements have not been met but have been substantially complied with.

4.       Conversions of projects containing four units or less shall not be subject to the above vacancy rate provisions.

D.      Planning Commission/City Council determination.

1.       The Commission shall hold a duly noticed public hearing on a condominium conversion project, and the decision of the Commission shall be final unless a timely appeal is filed.

2.       When a timely appeal is filed to a decision of the Commission, the Council shall hold a public hearing on a condominium conversion project, and the decision of the Council shall be final and subject to appeal only by way of writ of mandate to a court of appropriate jurisdiction. A condominium conversion project conditional use permit may be approved subject to such conditions as the Commission/Council may prescribe. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

 

25.72.070 Variances
A.      Purpose. Variances from the terms of this title shall be granted only when, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application of this title deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification. Any variance shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and district in which such property is situated.

B.      Applicability. The power to grant variances and adjustments does not extend to use regulations. Flexibility to the zoning regulations is provided in the conditions use provisions of this title.

C.      Application—Submittal requirements. Application for a variance shall be filed with the Department on a form prescribed by the Commission and shall include the following data and maps:

1.       Name and address of the applicant.

Statement of the precise nature of the variance requested and the practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship inconsistent with the objectives of the zoning regulations that would result from a strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation, together with any other data pertinent to the findings prerequisite to the granting of a variance.

5.       An accurate scale drawing of the site and any adjacent property affected, showing, when pertinent, the contours at intervals of not more than 2 feet, and all existing and proposed locations of streets, property lines, uses, structures, driveways, pedestrian walks, off-street parking facilities, and landscaped areas.

6.       A list of all owners of property located within 300 feet of the exterior boundaries of the subject property. The list shall be keyed to a map showing the location of these properties.

7.       The Director may require additional information or plans, if they are necessary, to enable a determination as to whether the circumstances prescribed for the granting of a variance exist. The Director may authorize omission of any or all of the plans and drawings required by this title if they are not necessary.

D.      Investigation and report. The Department shall make an investigation of each application that is subject of a public hearing and shall prepare a report thereon which shall be submitted to the Commission, and made available to the applicant prior to the public hearing.

E.       Hearing responsibility. All variance applications shall be heard and a determination shall be made by the Commission. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on an application for a variance. The hearing shall be set and notice given as prescribed in Section 25.60.060 (Public Hearing and Public Notice). At a public hearing, the Commission shall review the application, statements, and drawings submitted therewith and shall receive pertinent evidence concerning the variance, particularly with respect to the findings.

F.       Action of the Planning Commission. The Commission may grant a variance as the variance was applied for or in modified form, or the application may be denied. A variance may be granted for a limited time period, or may be granted subject to conditions as the Commission may prescribe.

G.      Findings. The Commission may grant a variance to a regulation prescribed by this title with respect to fences, walls, hedges, screening, or landscaping; site area, width, or depth; front, rear, or side yards; coverage, height of structures; distances between structures, usable open space, frontage on a public street, or other development standards as the variance was applied for or in modified form, if, on the basis of the application and the evidence submitted, the Commission makes findings of fact that establish that the circumstances prescribed in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 do apply:

1.       That strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship inconsistent with the objectives of the ordinance codified in this title.

2.       That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zone.

3.       That strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by the owners of other properties in the same vicinity and zone.

4.       That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.

H.      Determination. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on a variance as prescribed in Section 25.60.060 (Public Hearing and Public Notice) if an appeal has been filed within the prescribed 15-day appeal period.

I.        Effective date. A decision of the Commission on a variance shall be effective 15 days after the date of the decision unless an appeal has been filed. A variance shall become effective immediately after it is granted by the Council.

J.       Lapse of variance. A variance shall lapse and shall become void one year following the date on which the variance became effective unless prior to the expiration of one year, a building permit is issued and construction is commenced and diligently pursued toward completion on the site which was the subject of the variance application, or a permit is issued authorizing occupancy of the site or structure which was the subject of the variance application, or the site is occupied if no building permit or certificate of occupancy is required. Prior to the expiration of a permit, an applicant may request a 12-month time extension by filing with the Commission.

K.      Revocation. A variance granted by the Commission subject to conditions shall be revoked by the Commission if the applicant has not complied with the conditions. The decision of the Commission revoking a variance shall become effective 15 days following the date on which it was revoked unless an appeal has been filed. A variance granted by the Council shall be revoked only by the Council.

L.       New application. Following the denial or revocation of a variance application, no application for the same or substantially the same variance on the same or substantially the same site shall be filed within one year of the date of denial or revocation of the variance.

M.     Variance related to plans submitted. Unless otherwise specified at the time a variance is granted, it shall apply only to the plans and drawings submitted as part of the application. (Ord. 1259 § 1, 2013)

The commission may waive any irregularities in the proposed map if a determination is made that such irregularity is the result of a technical or inadvertent error which does not materially affect the validity of the map.

     B.     No map shall be approved unless the commission finds that the proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and improvement, is consistent with the General Plan.

     C.     The commission shall deny approval of a tentative map, as required by the Map Act, if it makes any of the following findings:

     1.     That the density of the proposed subdivision is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans;

     2.     That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans;

     3.     That the site is not physically suitable for the type of development;

     4.     That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of development;

     6.     That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements is likely to cause serious public health problems;

     7.     That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of, property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the governing body may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements, for access or for use, will be provided, and that these will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and no authority is granted to a legislative body to determine that the public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision.

     In approving a tentative map, the commission or council may grant a suspension of any of the subdivision requirements set forth or referred to in this title, except underground facilities which may be waived only by the council; provided such suspensions are not inconsistent with state law. A variance from the lot area, frontage, width, depth and front yard or setback requirements of the various zones set forth in this code, may also be granted by the commission or the council. Any such suspension or variance shall be based upon a sufficient showing that there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property in question and that such suspension or variance, if granted, will not be materially detrimental to the general welfare of adjacent persons or property, and such other findings for suspension or variance as may be required in other sections of this code. If such suspension or variance is requested, a public hearing shall be conducted as provided in Section 25.86.010 of this code.

     B.     All applications shall be filed sufficiently in advance of the expiration date to permit inclusion upon the commission agenda, and to permit commission action prior to such expiration date. At the time of consideration by the council of the extension of the approved tentative map, the commission may hear the testimony of any witnesses interested in the matter. Unless the subdivider and commission agree that additional time is needed for consideration, the commission shall declare its decision within twenty days of the matter appearing on its agenda. The commission may approve, or deny the request for extension.

     C.     The responsibility for making timely application for any extension shall remain entirely with the subdivider, and the city assumes no obligations to notify the subdivider that any tentative map or extension thereof is about to expire.

     Any revised tentative map shall comply with all the provisions of the Map Act and this title in effect at the time the revised map is approved. Proceedings on a revised tentative map shall be conducted in the same manner as for the original approval of a tentative map. The approval or conditional approval of a revised tentative map shall annul approval of the previous tentative map, but the approval thereof shall not extend the time within which the final map may be filed.

     All lots or parcels created by the subdivision of land shall have access to a public street improved to standards hereinafter required. Private streets, common driveways, or access easements shall not normally be permitted. However, if the commission determines that the most logical development of the land requires that lots be created which cannot easily be served by a public street, a private access may be approved. The subdivider shall submit a development plan showing the alignment, width, grade and material specifications of any proposed private improvements, the topography and means of access to each lot, drainage and sewerage of the lots served by such private improvements and a plan satisfactory to the city for ownership and maintenance of said access and the liability for taxes thereon. Construction of these improvements as approved by the city shall be completed prior to occupancy of any buildings on lots served by a private access. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.12-2)

 

26.40.030 Street standards.
     Streets shall conform to the following minimum conditions as set out in this section and Sections 26.40.040 through 26.40.100:

     Subdivision design shall conform to the concept of major streets designated in the general plan, and to any future street rights-of-way designated by the commission and approved by the council. Whenever a subdivision embraces any major street, it shall be included in the tract and shall be platted by the subdivider in the location generally indicated. If a specific location has been designated by the commission and approved by the council, that location shall be used. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-1.01)

 

26.40.040 Minimum standards.
     Typical sections of various classes of streets shall be in accord with the applicable city standard drawings, and in accord with Table 26.40.040.

     The basis for requirements for streets and roadway widths and design shall be the topography of the land and density of development in terms of the proposed number of dwellings to be served by said street or roadway on an ultimate basis. Reduced right-of-way width shall, in all cases, be sufficient to accommodate utility facilities within the right-of-way.

     Improvements as set forth in Chapter 26.44 shall be installed within the half of an existing or proposed street adjacent to the subdivision boundary. Substandard existing improvements shall be removed and replaced as directed by the city. Where such existing or proposed street has not previously been paved, paving having a minimum width from face of curb to edge of pavement of twenty-eight feet shall be installed.

     The subdivider shall dedicate all right-of-way for streets or portions of streets as necessary within the subdivision boundary. Full width dedications within the subdivision shall have complete improvements installed except that, upon secondary, major and arterial roads, paving upon each half may be a minimum of twenty-four feet in width from the face of curb to edge of pavement, subject to prior approval of the city.

     The standards set forth in this chapter are minimum, and additional on-site and/or off-site public improvements and dedications may be required. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-1.02)

 

26.40.050 Street pattern.
     The street pattern in the subdivision shall provide for the most advantageous development of the site and adjoining areas and the entire neighborhood or district.

     Where appropriate to the design and terrain, proposed streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. The centerlines of streets, if not in alignment, shall be offset at least two hundred feet unless otherwise approved by the city engineer for reasons of severe topography, one-way streets, or other unusual circumstances.

     Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the land to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the commission upon recommendation of the city engineer, such extension is not necessary for the coordination of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. Where reservation for future street is made, slope rights along the sides and end of the reserved area shall be preserved in the name of the city.

     In the case of stub-end streets extending to the boundary of the property, a one-foot strip at the end of the stub-end street the width of the street right-of-way shall be deeded to the city pending the extension of the street into adjacent property. Where required, a temporary turnaround or a temporary connection to another street shall be provided by the subdivider.

     Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles as topography and other limiting factors on good design permit. Streets shall be designed in a manner which will discourage the use of local streets for through traffic. Four-way intersections involving local streets shall be avoided whenever possible. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-1.03)

 

26.40.060 Design adjacent to arterial, major and secondary roads.
     Subdivision design shall be in general accord with the concepts of the general plan, and as determined by the commission.

     Street design should have the purpose of making adjacent lots, if for residential use, desirable for such use by cushioning the effect of heavy traffic and of minimizing the interference with traffic on such streets.

     The number of intersecting streets along arterial, major and secondary streets should be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, such intersections should be spaced not less than one thousand feet on center.

     Residential lots adjacent to these roads normally will be required to be served by a residential street paralleling the road or by a series of cul-de-sacs or loop streets extending the roads from a parallel street. Where such double frontage lots are created, improvements on such lots shall be oriented to a front upon the local street. A decorative wall of concrete block or of a comparable material approved by the design review board of the city, with a minimum height of six feet, shall be required at the property line or top of slope adjacent to the arterial, major or secondary road. Landscaping and permanent irrigation may be required.

     When the rear of any lot borders any arterial or major road, the subdivider shall be required to execute a certificate on the title sheet, deemed sufficient by the city attorney, prohibiting the right of ingress and egress from the major or arterial road to the lot. The council may require similar dedication in other instances where deemed necessary for health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-1.04)

 

26.40.070 Grade, curves and sight distances.
     Grades, curves and sight distances shall be subject to approval by the city engineer, to insure proper drainage and/or safety for vehicles and pedestrians.

     Grades of streets shall be not less than four-tenths percent, nor more than seven percent on arterial or major roads, ten percent on secondary roads, twelve percent on residential collector streets, and fifteen percent on residential streets. Maximum grade for hillside local streets shall not exceed twenty percent. Any grade segment in excess of twelve percent may not exceed three hundred feet in length. For all grades of twelve percent or more, the installation of a portland concrete road surface is required.

     At street intersections, property lines at each block shall be rounded by an arc, the radius of which shall not be less than ten feet and which shall be concentric with the curb return wherever possible.

     The radii of curvature shall not be less than that specified in the following table. Determination of which topography classification to be used shall be subject to approval by the city engineer.

26.40.080 Curbs, sidewalks, and pedestrian ways.
     Vertical concrete curbs and gutters and sidewalks shall be required in all subdivisions except as noted.

     The requirements for sidewalks may be omitted in whole or in part by the commission on all streets less than secondary highways; provided, that the findings are made that such sidewalks are not necessary because of any of the following:

     A.    The traffic count on a particular street is significantly reduced from the established standard for local streets as determined by the city engineer; or

     B.     The design or the topography of the subdivision and its relationship to adjoining properties and uses does not warrant the standard sidewalk requirements based if so recommended by the city engineer;

     C.     When required for access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation facilities, other community facilities, or for unusually long blocks, the commission may require pedestrian ways not less than twenty feet in right-of-way and paved with concrete a minimum of ten feet in width. Such pedestrian ways may be bordered on each side with sprinklered landscaping and a minimum six-foot-high chain link fence. In lieu of the chain link fence, the commission may require the subdivider to use a masonry wall as specified in this chapter, a minimum of six feet high, where they deem it necessary for any one of the following reasons:

     1.     Separation of land use,

     2.     Acoustical buffer,

     3.     Promotion of an architectural theme or compatibility of the area;

     D.    Where sidewalks are not required, concrete driveway aprons shall extend to the property line. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-1.06)

 

26.40.090 Street names and numbers.
     Street names shall be assigned by the director. Street numbers shall be assigned by the director of building and safety. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-1.07)

 

26.40.100 Cul-de-sacs.
     Cul-de-sacs shall be limited to a maximum length of six hundred feet and shall be provided with a turnaround having a minimum curbline radius of forty feet. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-1.08)

 

26.40.110 Hillside subdivisions and planned unit developments.
     In either a planned unit development or a hillside subdivision or portions thereof which have an average lot size of twenty thousand square feet or larger and have an average slope in excess of ten percent prior to grading, the commission, in the exercise of its discretion, may modify the requirements of this chapter in a manner that will result in the best possible utilization of the land to be subdivided, giving consideration to the topography and natural cover of the land, the general character of the proposed subdivision, the proposed zoning and the desirability of minimizing grading upon the site. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-2)

 

26.40.120 Atlas maps.
     The subdivider shall provide the city with accurate maps of the subdivision at scales of 1” = 200’ and 1” = 600’ for use by the city in updating its atlas maps. The maps may be dual purpose, e.g., vicinity map, grading plan, tract map, etc., and shall contain the following minimum information:

 

200’ scale:

Streets:

Name and width

 

Lots:

Number and dimensions

 

Easements:

Type and dimension;

600’ scale:

Outline of streets and lots; no dimensions

 

 

(Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-3)

 

26.40.130 Utility easements.
     Easements for water, drainage or sewer purposes shall be provided as necessary, with a minimum width of ten feet. Easements for large structures or unusually deep structures shall be of such greater width as may be specified by the city engineer. Any reduction in width shall require approval of both the city engineer and the utility involved. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-4)

 

26.40.140 Lot standards.
     The size, shape and orientation of lots, each of which shall constitute a practical building site, shall be appropriate to the location of the proposed subdivision and to the type of development contemplated.

     The following principles and standards shall be observed:

     A.    The side lines of all lots, so far as possible, should be at approximately right angles to the street which the lot faces, or approximately radial to the center of the curvature of a cul-de-sac on which the lot faces.

     B.     No lot shall be divided by a city or special district boundary line.

     C.     No remnants of property, with the exception of one foot control lots, shall be created which do not conform to lot requirements, or are not required for a private or public utility purpose.

     D.    The division of a lot or parcel by a tax code boundary shall not be permitted.

     E.     Lot lines between adjacent lots within a subdivision should be located at the top of any grading slope which may be proposed at such location.

     F.     Unless otherwise altered by the provisions of a planned unit development, the minimum lot depth for a residential development shall be not less than one hundred feet with the following exception: Lots adjacent to freeways, major streets or collector roads shall utilize a minimum lot depth of one hundred ten feet to provide sufficient separation from the road noise and to facilitate the usable lot area.

     G.    In determining the permissible lot size, all public utility transmission line easements shall be required to be excluded. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-5)

 

26.40.150 Block design.
     Blocks shall normally have sufficient width for an ultimate layout of two tiers of lots of the size required by the provisions of the zoning ordinance as codified in Title 25.

     Blocks shall not normally exceed fifteen hundred feet in length between street lines, except in hillside developments or where subdivisions containing parcels of one-half acre or larger justify or require a variation from this requirement. In any block over nine hundred feet in length there shall be a crosswalk or pedestrian way in accordance with Section 26.40.080. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-6)

 

26.40.160 Nonresidential subdivisions.
     The street and lot layout of a nonresidential subdivision shall be appropriate to the land use for which the subdivision is proposed, and shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in the general plan and zoning ordinance as codified in Title 25.

     In addition to the principles and standards in this title which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the subdivider shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission that the street, parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity.

     The following principles and standards shall be observed:

     A.    Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.

     B.     Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereon.

     C.     Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to street, curb, gutter and sidewalk design and construction.

     D.    Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and storm drainage.

     E.     Nonresidential subdivisions shall be designed to protect adjacent areas from potential nuisance from the proposed nonresidential subdivisions, including the provisions of extra depth and setback in parcels backing up on existing or potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped buffer strip when determined necessary by the commission.

     F.     Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or potential residential areas, or connected to streets intended for predominantly residential traffic.

     G.    Nonresidential subdivisions shall take into account and specifically designate all private areas proposed for vehicular circulation and parking, for pedestrian circulation, and for buffer strips and other landscaping.

     H.    Buffer strips shall consist of landscaped areas which are designed to shield and otherwise soften the effect of the nonresidential subdivision on nearby residential areas. Such buffer strips shall be improved to standards as specified in Title 25, zoning. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.13-7)

Chapter 26.44 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS AND GRADING
26.44.010 Minimum requirements.
     The subdivider shall improve or agree to improve all streets, thoroughfares, public ways or public or private easements within the development and adjacent thereto, as required to serve the development. No grading or improvement work shall be commenced until either an appropriate subdivision improvement agreement, land alteration permit, or street encroachment permit has been approved and any necessary bonds posted. Improvements shall be installed to line and grade and in accordance with the standard drawings and specifications of the city and/or as determined by the city engineer. Street structural sections shall be designed in accordance with the “Division of Highways stabilometer method” or such comparable method as may be approved by the city engineer. The minimum improvements which the subdivider shall normally be required to agree to install, at his own cost, in the creation of a parcel or parcels shall include the following:

     A.    Grading, curbs and gutter, paving and drainage structures necessary for the proper use and drainage of the development, streets, highways and/or public safety;

     B.     Site grading and drainage, taking into consideration the drainage pattern of adjacent improved or unimproved property and making drainage provisions adequate for total ultimate development of the natural tributary area. Runoff quantities to be anticipated shall be derived from the drainage study as defined in this chapter, or by such other method as may be approved by the city engineer. Alternate methods shall be fully substantiated by the engineer of work. Grading shall be in full conformity with the provisions of the appropriate ordinances of the city. Drainage facilities and concepts shall conform to the requirements of the Coachella Valley County water district and the city engineer;

     C.     Street name and traffic control signs;

     D.    Sidewalks and bicycle paths;

     E.     Fire hydrants and a water system with mains of sufficient size and capacity to provide future extensions to adjacent property and having a sufficient number of services to furnish an adequate water supply for each lot or parcel in the subdivision and to provide adequate fire protection. Water system mains shall extend to the boundaries of the parcel map and subdivision. All domestic water shall be taken from the city-approved public system serving the subdivision;

     F.     Sanitary sewer facilities and connections for each lot. Sewer mains, whose size and depth shall be adequate to serve adjacent and upstream properties, shall extend to the boundaries of the parcel split or subdivision;

     G.    Street trees as required by the director;

     H.    Underground utilities;

     I.      Provision shall be made for any and all railroad crossings necessary to provide access to or circulation within the proposed subdivision, including the preparation of all documents necessary for application to the state Public Utilities Commission for the establishment and improvement of such crossings;

     J.      Mid-block pedestrian ways, where required;

     K.    Improvements on private access easements shall be required as determined by the city engineer;

     L.     Street lighting facilities shall be provided in accordance with the council’s policy for the area of the city where the subdivision is located. Lighting shall be adequate to permit proper policing of the subdivision and shall be so screened or otherwise designed as not to interfere with views from the hillsides of the city;

     M.    All utility distribution lines including, but not limited to electric, communication, natural gas, and cable television lines installed in and for the purpose of supplying service to any subdivision shall be placed underground. Undergrounding shall include existing aboveground facilities located within the subdivision and extending to the first existing pole outside the subdivision.

     Equipment appurtenant to underground facilities, such as surface-mounted transformers, street light poles, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets and concealed ducts may be installed above the surface of the ground subject to the approval of the city engineer.

     The subdivider is responsible for complying with the requirements of this section, and shall make the necessary arrangements with the utility companies involved for the installation of the facilities;

     N.    Traffic signals in an amount proportionate to the benefits received according to rules and regulations as may be adopted from time to time by the council. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.14-1)

 

26.44.020 Underground utilities.
     All underground utilities, including, but not limited to, sanitary sewers, storm drains and natural gas distribution facilities installed in streets or alleys shall be constructed prior to the surfacing of such streets or alleys. Connections for all underground utilities and sanitary sewers shall be laid to such length as will obviate the necessity for disturbing the street or alley improvements when the service connections thereto are made. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.14-2)

 

26.44.030 Wells.
     All wells shall be abandoned by sealing in a manner satisfactory to the city engineer or shall be transferred to the ownership of the cognizant water agency serving the property unless specific approval to retain the well for private use is granted by the city at the time of approval of the tentative map. The locations of such wells shall be shown on the final map and well logs, if available, shall be submitted to the Coachella Valley County water district. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.14-3)

 

26.44.040 Completion.
     A complete improvement plan “as built” shall be filed with the city engineer upon completion of these improvements; the “as built” plans to be drawn on copies of the original tracings and certified as to accuracy and completeness by the subdivider’s licensed contractor. Upon receipt and acceptance of the “as built” plans, the city engineer may accept the public improvements. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.14-4)

 

26.44.050 Acceptance of improvements.
     The city engineer shall have the authority and responsibility to accept public improvements and approve site grading relative to subdivision of land whether through the major subdivision process or the parcel split process. Completion of all improvements and/or grading as contemplated by the subdivision improvement agreement, the land alteration permit or the street encroachment permit is a condition of approval and acceptance. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.14-5)

 

26.44.060 Public utility lines—Dedications.
     The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to limit or interfere with the installation, maintenance and operation of water lines, sewer lines, gas lines, other public utility pipelines, and electric, cable and open video systems, telephone or telegraph transmission lines when installed, maintained and operated in accordance with all other applicable laws. Pursuant to Title 23, Section 23.03.030, and notwithstanding anything in this municipal code to the contrary, utility distribution facilities for electricity that are installed within the designated spot municipal utility and completed from and after enactment of this section, shall be dedicated to the city. (Ord. 1050 § 3, 2003)

Chapter 26.48 NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY PUBLIC FACILITIES
26.48.010 Purpose.
     It is the purpose and intent of the provisions of this chapter to require the reservation or dedication of land directly benefiting the regulated subdivision in order to provide for necessary public facilities including, but not limited to, sites for parks and recreational areas, open space, or other public facilities as deemed necessary. In addition to requirements for reservation and dedication of lands, provision is made in this chapter for the payment of fees in lieu thereof for the acquisition of lands outside of the regulated subdivision, which lands will provide equivalent sites for the purposes set forth in this chapter to benefit the regulated subdivision. In each case it is the intent that the subdivision will receive the direct benefit upon which the exaction was postulated. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.15-1)

 

26.48.020 Neighborhood facilities.
     The subdivider may be required to reserve sites, appropriate in area and location, for necessary and desirable neighborhood facilities, such as parks and playgrounds. Such sites shall be located in accordance with the principles and standards contained in this chapter or expressed in the general plan. School sites may be required to be dedicated in accordance with the provisions of Section 66478 of the Map Act. Recreation sites shall be dedicated in accordance with the provisions of Section 64477 of the Map Act and the provisions of this code, or in the alternative a fee shall be paid as required in this chapter. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.15-2)

 

26.48.030 Determination of need.
     The neighborhood facilities needed shall be determined on the basis of the estimated number of families in the area to be served by the facilities. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.15-3)

 

26.48.040 Service area.
     The definition of service areas determining the need for neighborhood facilities at the district or community level shall be based on the general plan. The planning neighborhood will normally provide the basis for estimating the number of families to be served by facilities at the local level. A planning neighborhood shall insofar as possible exhibit the following characteristics:

     A.    It is bounded, rather than bisected, by major thoroughfares or other substantial land use or natural barriers to pedestrian traffic.

     B.     It is usually not over a mile in extent in any direction.

     C.     It contains a minimum of five hundred families. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.15-4)

 

26.48.050 Principles and standards.
     The following principles and standards are intended to serve as a general guide in determining the neighborhood facilities for which sites normally will be required:

     A.    Wherever possible, playground and neighborhood recreation areas shall be developed in conjunction with elementary school sites.

     B.     Where ravines, including natural waterways, are included within the boundaries of a subdivision, such ravines may, at the discretion of the city, be reserved for public use, including recreation and the disposal of stormwaters. These purposes may be accomplished through dedication and/or storm drainage and scenic easements. (Ord. 125 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 26.15-5)

 

26.48.060 Dedication of land and fees for park and recreation purposes.
     A.    For residential subdivisions of greater than fifty lots, the subdivider shall dedicate land or pay a fee, or combination thereof, in such ratio recommended by the commission and approved by the council. Dedication shall be equivalent to five acres per one thousand population projected to inhabit the subdivision. The fee shall be based on the average appraised current market value of the undeveloped land in the subdivision as determined by the county assessor.

     B.     For subdivisions containing fifty lots or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee equivalent to five acres per one thousand population projected in the subdivision. Fees shall be calculated according to procedure set forth in subsection A of this section.

     C.     Projected population shall be calculated by multiplying the number of units to be constructed by the average household size for the entire city as shown on the latest federal census or a census taken pursuant to Section 40200, Chapter 17 of Part 2 of Division 3 of Title 4 of the Government Code.

     D.    All land to be dedicated for park or recreational purposes shall be found to be suitable by the commission and the cognizant recreation agency subject to council approval as to locations, parcel size, and topography for the park. Park and recreation purposes may include active recreation facilities such as playgrounds, playfields, gardens, pedestrian or bicycle paths or areas of particular natural beauty, including canyons, hilltops and wooded areas to be developed or left in their natural state. Also included are land and facilities for the activity of “recreational community gardening,” which activity consists of the cultivation by persons other than, or in addition to, the owner of such land, of plant material not for sale.

     E.     Land to be dedicated may include all or part of a proposed facility. Fees are to be used for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitation of existing park or recreational facilities to serve the subdivision.

     F.     Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this section; provided, however, that a condition may be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels within four years the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit.

     B.     The amount of fee shall be calculated on full and partial acres, carried to the nearest one hundredth of a percentage. In the case of land to be subdivided, the fee shall apply for any and all uses to which the land may be put. In the case of construction or improvement of subdivided land, the fee shall apply only to new commercial, industrial, professional, group dwelling or community facility use (see Section 25.56.080 of this code).

     C.     Said fees shall be collected, deposited and expended pursuant to Section 66483 of the Government Code of the state of California and all other applicable laws of the state of California. All necessary drainage fees established by the city shall be deposited with the city prior to approval of the final map in the case of land being subdivided, or prior to issuance of a building permit in the case of construction or improvement of subdivided land. The city shall have the right, in lieu of accepting cash, to accept any other proper and valid consideration as may be determined by the city.

     D.    Fees imposed pursuant to this section are the amounts necessary for the purposes set forth in the City’s master drainage plan. The city may impose additional or reduced fees or a case-by-case basis where a need for such additional or reduced fee is demonstrated as required by Government Code Section 66001. (Ord. 653 § 2, 1992; Ord. 507 § 1, 1987; Ord. 308 § 1, 1982; Ord. 218 § 2, 1979)

 

26.49.060 Required on-site retention.
     Developments or redevelopments of one gross acre or more in size shall be designed to retain the stormwater from a one hundred year, twenty-four hour, duration storm on site. (Ord. 1247 § 3, 2012; Ord. 218 § 2, 1979)

 

26.49.070 Relation to existing facilities.
     All drainage facilities set forth in the master plans of drainage for the city are in addition to present local drainage facilities serving the drainage area. This chapter shall apply to all subdivisions of land as well as developments of land within the drainage area. (Ord. 218 § 2, 1979)

Chapter 26.52 LIMITATION ON FINAL DECISIONS
26.52.010 Limitations.
     Any action or proceeding to attach, review, set aside, void or annul the decision of the council concerning a subdivision, or any of the proceedings, acts or determinations taken, done or made prior to such decision, or to determine the reasonableness, legality or validity of any condition attached thereto in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall not be maintained by any person unless such item or proceeding is commenced within one hundred eighty days after the date of such decision.

27.12.035 Fills.
     A.    Method of Construction. All fill slopes fifteen feet in height or more and steeper than three horizontal to one vertical shall be constructed by the “over fill and cutback” method. These slopes shall be overbuilt and cut back to grade exposing the firm compacted fill innercore. The actual amount of overbuilding may vary as field conditions dictate. If the desired results are not achieved, the existing slopes shall be overexcavated as directed by the soils engineer and reconstructed. The degree of overbuilding shall be increased until the desired compacted slope surface condition is achieved. Care shall be taken by the contractor to provide thorough mechanical compaction to the outer edge of the overbuilt slope surface. As fill slope construction proceeds, the slope surface shall be thoroughly backrolled with a sheepsfoot roller at vertical height intervals not exceeding four feet.

     Following the attainment of the desired slope height, the outer surface of overbuilt slopes shall be cut back to the finished surface contour shown on the approved grading plan. Care shall be taken by the contractor not to excavate beyond the desired finished slope surface.

     B.     Alternate Method of Construction. Fill slopes less than fifteen feet in height or flatter than three horizontal to one vertical may be constructed by alternative procedures where specifically approved by the soils engineer prior to grading. Prior to such approval, the contractor shall submit to the soils engineer a detailed written description of the procedure he proposes to utilize. Within such description, the following guidelines shall be included. Unless slopes are overfilled and cut back to grade, the outer faces of all fill slopes shall be backrolled utilizing a sheepsfoot roller at intervals not exceeding four feet of vertical slope height. Vibratory methods may be required. During construction of the fill slopes, care shall be taken to maintain near-optimum moisture conditions over the entire slope height. Following achievement of the slope height as shown on the approved grading plan, the entire slope face shall be thoroughly compacted utilizing a vibratory sheepsfoot roller. Upon completion of the above procedures, the faces of all fill slopes shall be grid-rolled over the entire slope height with standard grid-rolling type of equipment. Prior to grid-rolling, care shall be taken to maintain near-optimum moisture conditions.

     Following slope construction in the manner described above, if the required uniformly compacted fill slope condition is not achieved, overfilling and cutting back shall be required. Completed slopes not approved by the soils engineer shall be overexcavated a minimum of twelve feet (horizontal) and replaced by the overfilling and cutting back procedure described in subsection A of this section. (Ord. 294, 1982)

 

27.12.040 Slope design.
     All slopes to be constructed in connection with land development shall be designed for proper stability after carefully considering such geological factors and soil properties which may affect that stability. The design of all slopes shall not be steeper than two horizontal to one vertical in fill or one and one-half horizontal to one vertical in cut and shall be substantiated with a report by the soils engineer, certifying that he has investigated the property and that in his opinion the proposed steeper slope will not endanger any public or private property.

     A.    Where the existing grade is at or below street elevation, the following shall apply:

     1.     In areas where full street improvements exist (curb, gutter and complete paving), the maximum finished pad height shall be no more than twelve inches above the top of curb elevation, measured at the lowest point along the lot frontage curb line, and be compatible with surrounding adjacent properties, as determined by the city engineer.

     2.     In areas where full street improvements do not exist, the maximum finished pad height shall not be more than twelve inches above the crown line elevation of the street, measured at the lowest point along the lot frontage, and be compatible with surrounding adjacent properties, as determined by the city engineer.

     B.     Where the existing grade is above street elevation, the following shall apply:

     1.     The pad elevation shall be compatible with surrounding adjacent properties as determined by the city engineer.

     C.

     The city engineer shall enforce the provisions of this title. He may delegate to the city building official such authority for the administration of this title as he deems appropriate. (Ord. 294, 1982; Ord. 126 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 27.5-1)

 

27.28.020 Permit issuance.
     The city engineer shall, upon application by qualified persons, issue permits in connection with land alteration when all applicable conditions established by this title for such permits have been met. He may attach such conditions as he deems appropriate to protect health, safety, and welfare. (Ord. 294, 1982; Ord. 126 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 27.5-1.01)

 

27.28.030 No work to continue without permit.
     The city engineer shall cause land alteration being done without a permit to be stopped until a permit has been obtained. He may require that such work done without a permit be removed or corrected at the expense of the responsible person. Where land alteration work involves an embankment improperly constructed or constructed without adequate testing, he shall cause such embankment to be reconstructed or, in lieu thereof, shall cause a declaration of improper land alteration to be recorded in the office of the county recorder. (Ord. 294, 1982; Ord. 126 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 27.5-1.02)

 

27.28.035 Work without permit.
     Any work done without a permit when a permit is required by this chapter is unlawful and a public nuisance. The city engineer or city building official may issue a stop work notice upon determination that a public nuisance is taking place. Upon order of the city council, the city attorney shall commence necessary proceedings for the abatement, removal and/or enjoinment of any such public nuisance in the manner provided by law. Any failure, refusal or neglect to obtain a permit as required by this chapter shall be prima facie evidence of the fact that a public nuisance has been committed in connection with the work begun or done contrary to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 314 § 2, 1987; Ord. 294, 1982)

 

27.28.037 Belated permit—double fees.
     If a work commenced or done for which a permit is required by this chapter before a permit is obtained, the permit fee shall be doubled. The payment of such double fee shall not waive compliance with this chapter. Such double fee is not a penalty but is a payment to defray the added costs of special inspections required for enforcement of the provisions of this chapter in such cases. The imposition or payment of such double fee shall not prevent the imposition of a penalty. (Ord. 514 § 2, 1987; Ord. 294, 1982)

Chapter 27.32 FEES
27.32.010 Computation and payment.
     Fees shall be in accordance with the current fee schedule as may be adopted from time to time by council resolution.

     For excavation and fill on the same site, the fee shall be based on the volume of excavation or fill, whichever is greater. If it is determined that the volume of excavation or fill incident to the grading is greater than the volume on which the land alteration fee was initially computed, the applicant shall pay any additional fee based upon the recomputed volume of excavation or fill. The estimates shall be made or verified by the city engineer.

     Fees required by this chapter shall be collected by the city finance officer.

     No permit shall be issued and no land alteration shall be permitted until the applicable fees have been received by the city finance officer. (Ord. 294, 1982; Ord. 126 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 27.6-1)

 

27.32.020 State work—Permit and fees.

     Ninety percent of the fee for a land alteration permit shall be refundable if no inspections have been done by the city and the work is abandoned. (Ord. 514 § 2, 1987; Ord. 294, 1982; Ord. 126 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 27.6-2)

 

27.32.040 Fee for failure to obtain permit.
     In the event that land alteration work is commenced without benefit of a land alteration permit, the city engineer shall cause such work to be stopped until a permit is obtained. The permit fee in such instance shall be double that which would normally be required. The payment of such double fee shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of this title in the performance of the work. Such fee shall not be construed to be a penalty, but shall be construed as an added fee required to defray the expense of enforcement of the provisions of this title in such cases. The imposition or payment of such double fee shall not prevent the imposition of any penalty prescribed or imposed by this title. (Ord. 294, 1982; Ord. 126 § 1, 1976, Exhibit A § 27.6-3)

Chapter 28.02 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS
28.02.010 Statutory authorization.
     The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of Palm Desert does adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.02.020 Findings of fact.
     A.    The flood hazard areas of Palm Desert are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

     B.     These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards, which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.02.030 Statement of purpose.
     It is the purpose of this title to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

     A.    Protect human life and health;

     B.     Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

     C.     Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

     D.    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

     E.     Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

     F.     Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;

     G.    Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

     H.    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.02.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
     In order to accomplish its purposes, this title includes methods and provisions to:

     A.    Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

     B.     Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

     C.     Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

     D.    Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which, may increase flood damage; and

     E.     Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

Chapter 28.04 DEFINITIONS
28.04.010 Definitions.
     Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this title its most reasonable application.

     “Accessory use” means a use, which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

     “Alluvial fan” means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders; gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.

     “Apex” means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front.

     “Appeal” means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this title.

     “Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

     Area of Special Flood Hazard. See “Special flood hazard area.”

     “Area of special flood-related erosion hazard” is the land within a community, which is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).

     “Area of special mudslide (mudflow) hazard” is the area subject to severe mudslides (mud flows). The area is designated as Zone M on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).

     “Base flood” means a flood, which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “100-year flood”). Base flood is the term used throughout this title.

     “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade, i.e., below ground level on all sides.

     “Breakaway walls” are any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by flood waters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

     1.     Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood, and

     2.     The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

     Building. See “Structure.”

     “Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

     “Flood-related erosion” means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such. as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.

     “Flood-related erosion area” or “Flood-related erosion prone area” means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.

     “Flood-related erosion area management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations.

     “Floodplain or flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water, from any source. See “Flooding.”

     “Floodplain Administrator” is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

     “Floodplain management regulations” means this title and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

     “Flood proofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents.

     “Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either side of the “regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.

     “Fraud and victimization” as related to Chapter 28.12, Variance Procedure, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

     “Functionally dependent use” means a use, which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.

     “Hardship” as related to Chapter 28.12, Variance Procedure, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

     “Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

     “Historic structure” means any structure that is:

     1.     An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:

     a.     The anchoring standards in Section 28.10.010(A).

     b.     The wet flood-proofing standard in Section 28.10.010(C)(3).

     “Market value” shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation, that has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences.

     “Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

     “Mudslide” describes a condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.

     “Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area” means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow.

     “Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

     “Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

     “Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

     “Sand dunes” mean naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.

     Sheet Flow Area. See “Area of shallow flooding.”

     “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

     “Structure” means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.

     “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

     “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

     1.     Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or

     2.     Any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

     “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this title.

     “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this title. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this title is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

     “Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

     “Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

Chapter 28.06 GENERAL PROVISIONS
28.06.010 Lands to which this title applies.
     This title shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of Palm Desert. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.06.020 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
     The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated October 1979, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), dated April 15, 1980, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this title. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this title and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this title and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at the public works department, Palm Desert Civic Center, 73-510 Fred Waring Drive, Palm Desert, California. (Ord. 1317 § 16, 2017; Ord. 1228 § 1, 2011; Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.06.030 Compliance.
     No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this title and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.06.040 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

However, where this title and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.06.050 Interpretation.
     In the interpretation and application of this title, all provisions shall be:

     A.    Considered as minimum requirements;

     B.     Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

     C.     Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.06.060 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
     The degree of flood protection required by this title is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This title does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This title shall not create liability on the part of the city council, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this title or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

28.08.020 Designation of the floodplain administrator.
     The director of public works or designated representative is appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this title by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.08.030 Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.
     The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following.

     A.    Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that:

     1.     Permit requirements of this title have been satisfied;

     2.     All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;

     3.     The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and

     4.     The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this title, “adversely affects” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.

     B.     Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data.

     1.     When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 28.06.020, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Chapter 28.10. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption; or

     2.     If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas — A Guide for Ob-

taining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations” dated July 1995 in order to administer Chapter 28.10:

     a.     Simplified Method.

     i.      One hundred-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication, or the discharge-drainage area method, and

     ii.     Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA, or

     b.     Detailed Method.

     i.      One hundred-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ HEC-HMS computer program, and

     ii.     Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ HEC-RAS computer program.

     C.     Notification of Other Agencies. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse:

     1.     Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;

     2.     Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

     3.     Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

     D.    Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations.

     1.     Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR).

     2.     All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

     E.     Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available, as needed the following:

     1.     Certification required by Sections 28.10.010(C)(1) and 28.10.040;

     2.     Certification required by Section 28.10.010(C)(2);

     3.     Certification required by Section 28.10.010(C)(3);

     4.     Certification of elevation required by Section 28.10.030(B);

     5.     Certification required by Section 28.10.060(A);

     6.     Reports required by Section 28.10.080(C).

     F.     Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Chapter 28.12.

     G.    Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this title as specified in Section 28.06.030. (Ord. 1228 § 2, 2011; Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.08.040 Appeals.
     The city council of Palm Desert shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this title. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

Chapter 28.10 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
28.10.010 Standards of construction.
     In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:

     A.    Anchoring.

     1.     All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.

     2.     All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of Section 28.10.040.

     B.     Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed:

     1.     With flood resistant materials as specified in FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 2-93, and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;

     2.     Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;

     3.     With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and if

     4.     Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

     C.     Elevation and Flood Proofing. (See Chapter 28.04 definitions for “basement,” “lowest floor,” “new construction,” “substantial damage” and “substantial improvement.”)

     1.     Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, including basement:

     a.     In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. The state of California recommends that in AO zones without velocity the lowest floor be elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM by at least two feet, or elevated at least four feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.

     b.     In an A zone, elevated to or above the base flood elevation; said base flood elevation shall be determined by one of the methods in Section 28.08.030(B) of this title. The state of California recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation, as determined by the community.

     c.     In all other zones, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. The state of California recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation.

28.10.060 Floodways.
     Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 28.06.020 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply.

     A.    Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

     B.     If Section 28.10.060(A) is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Chapter 28.10. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.10.070 Mudslide (mudflow) prone areas.
     A.    The floodplain administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area.

     B.     Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include but are not limited to the:

     1.     Type and quality of soils;

     2.     Evidence of ground water or surface water problems;

     3.     Depth and quality of any fill;

     4.     Overall slope of the site; and

     5.     Weight that any proposed development would impose on the slope.

     C.     Within areas, which may have mudslide hazards, the floodplain administrator shall require that:

     1.     A site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering;

     2.     The proposed grading, excavation, new construction, and substantial improvement be adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages;

     3.     The proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site of off-site disturbances; and

     4.     Drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.10.080 Flood-related erosion-prone area.
     A.    The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas as known to the community.

     B.     Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard.

     C.     If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard.

     D.    Within Zone E on the FIRM, a setback is required for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated “useful life” of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

Chapter 28.12 VARIANCE PROCEDURE
28.12.010 Nature of variances.
     The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

     It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure, built below flood level, are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.12.020 Appeal board.
     A.    In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this title, and the:

     1.     Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

     2.     Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

     3.     Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

     4.     Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

     5.     Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

     6.     Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

     7.     Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

     8.     Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

     9.     Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

     10.   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

     11.   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

     B.     Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

     1.     The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and

     2.     Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Riverside County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

     C.     The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

 

28.12.030 Conditions for variances.
     A.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Chapters 28.08 and 28.10 of this title have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

     B.     Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in Chapter 28.04 of this title) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

     C.     Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

     D.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this title. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the governing body need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

     E.     Variances shall only be issued upon a:

     1.     Showing of good and sufficient cause;

     2.     Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional “hardship” (as defined in Chapter 28.04 of this title) to the applicant; and

     3.     Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Chapter 28.04 — see “public safety or nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization, (as defined in Chapter 28.04), of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

     F.     Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A through E of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

     G.    Upon consideration of the factors of Section 28.12.020A and the purposes of this title, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this title. (Ord. 985 § 1, 2001)

     A.    The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties summarized as follows:

     1.     The anticipated use for the property remains that for which it was originally intended or requires minimal alteration for the proposed reuse;

     2.     The distinguishing original qualities or character of a cultural resource or historic district and its environment shall not be compromised. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive features should be avoided when possible;

     3.     All cultural resources shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to recreate an earlier appearance shall be discouraged;

     4.     Certain alterations which may have taken place in the course of time are potentially significant to understanding the history and development of a cultural resource and its environment. These historic alterations may have acquired significance in their own right and this significance shall be recognized and respected;

     5.     Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship, which characterize a cultural resource, shall be retained;

     6.     Deteriorated features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new feature should match the feature being replaced in material, composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair and replacement of missing features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different elements from other sources;

     7.     Surface cleaning shall be undertaken with proven methods as designated by the Secretary of the Interior Standards that shall avoid damage to the historic materials;

     8.     Contemporary design for alterations and additions shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not compromise significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the cultural resource and its environs;

     9.     Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to the cultural resource shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the resource would be unimpaired;

     10.   Archaeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources will be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken;

     11.   Any other Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties may also be applied as appropriate.

     B.     Applicable design guidelines.

     C.     The goals and policies of this chapter; and

     D.    The goals and policies of the general plan and any applicable specific or community plan, rules and regulations in the city of Palm Desert. (Ord. 1168, 2008)

     B.     The proposed project is consistent or compatible with the architectural style and the character-defining elements of the cultural resource;

     C.     The proposed project does not destroy or adversely affect an important architectural, historical, cultural or archaeological feature or features;

     D.    The colors, textures, materials, fenestration, decorative features, details, height, scale, massing and methods of construction proposed are consistent with the period and style of the cultural resource;

     E.     The proposed project is compatible with adjacent or nearby cultural resources and their character-defining elements and will not adversely affect the character of a historic district;

     F.     The proposed project is not fully consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards, but is consistent with and supportive of identified goals and policies of the general plan or applicable community or specific plan(s) and the project is generally consistent with and supportive of the goals and policies of this chapter; and

Title 30 PREFERENTIAL PARKING
Chapter 30.01 RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING AREAS

Chapter 30.01 RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING AREAS
30.01.010 Legislative purpose.
     This title is enacted in response to the serious adverse effects caused in certain areas and neighborhoods of the city by motor vehicle congestion, particularly the long-term parking of motor vehicles on the streets of such areas and neighborhoods by nonresidents thereof who do not visit or conduct business with residents. Such parking by nonresidents threatens the health, safety and welfare of all the residents of the city. In order to protect these areas and neighborhoods, it is necessary to enact parking regulations restricting parking by nonresidents therein, while providing the opportunity for residents to park near their homes. In these situations, uniform parking regulations restricting residents and nonresidents alike would not serve the public interest. Rather such regulations would contribute to neighborhood decline while ignoring alternatives to automobile travel available to non-residents who park in these areas. For the reasons set forth in this chapter, a system of preferential resident parking is enacted for the city. (Ord. 887 § 1, 1998)

 

30.01.020 Legislative findings.
     A.    General Findings. The city council finds that serious adverse effects in certain areas and neighborhoods of the city result from motor vehicle congestion, particularly long-term parking of motor vehicles on the streets of such areas and neighborhoods by nonresidents thereof who do not visit or conduct business with residents. The permit program established by this chapter will relieve these serious adverse affects by:

     1.     Reducing potential hazardous traffic conditions resulting from the long-term parking of commuter motor vehicles in neighborhoods;

     2.     Protecting such areas and neighborhoods from polluted air, excessive noise, and trash and refuse caused by the entry and exit of such motor vehicles;

     3.     Protecting the residents of such areas and neighborhoods from unreasonable burdens in obtaining parking near their residences and in gaining access to their residence;

     4.     Preserving the character of such areas and neighborhoods as residential; promoting the efficiency of the maintenance of the streets of such areas and neighborhoods in a clean and safe condition;

     5.     Preserving the value of property in such areas and neighborhoods;

     6.     Preserving the safety of children and other pedestrians; and

     7.     Promoting traffic safety and the peace, good order, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city.

     B.     Specific Findings. The following specific legislative findings of the city council in support of preferential resident parking are set forth as illustrations of the need compelling the enactment of this chapter. These findings do not exhaust the subject of the factual basis supporting the enactment of this preferential resident parking program.

     1.     The safety, health, and welfare of the residents of the city can be greatly enhanced by maintenance of the attractiveness and livability of its neighborhoods and other residential areas;

     2.     A large number of Palm Desert residents possess automobiles and, as a result, are daily faced with the need to store these automobiles in or near their residences;

     3.     Certain neighborhoods and areas of the city either have marginally sufficient on or off-street space to accommodate the convenient parking of motor vehicles by residents thereof in the vicinity of their homes or have insufficient space therefore;

     4.     Some neighborhoods and areas as described in subsection (B)(3) of this section are often burdened by the parking in such neighborhoods and areas of motor vehicles owned by nonresidents which compete for the available on-street parking spaces;

     5.     There exists certain parking “generators” within the city, which attract nonresidents to residential areas to seek parking which increases the severity of the shortage of space for resident parking in such neighborhoods and residential areas;

     6.     Unnecessary vehicle miles, noise, pollution, and strain on interpersonal relationships caused by the conditions set forth herein create unacceptable hardships on residents of these neighborhoods and areas by causing the deterioration of air quality, safety, tranquility, and other values of the urban residential environment;

     7.     If allowed to continue, these adverse effects on the residents of the city will contribute to a decline of the living conditions therein, a reduction in the attractiveness of residing within the city, and consequent injury to the general public welfare. The regulations enacted in this chapter will serve to promote the safety, health and welfare of all the residents of the city by reducing unnecessary personal motor vehicle travel, noise and pollution, and by promoting improvement in air quality, the convenience and attractiveness of urban residential living, and the increased use of public mass transit facilities available now and in the future. The public welfare will also be served by preserving a more stable and valuable property tax base in order to generate the revenues required to provide essential public services.

     A resident motor vehicle or nonresident motor vehicle on which is displayed a valid parking permit as provided for herein shall be permitted to stand or be parked in the residential permit parking area for which the permit has been issued without being limited by parking regulations established pursuant to this chapter. Said motor vehicle shall not be exempt from parking restrictions or prohibitions established pursuant to authority other than this chapter. All other motor vehicles parked within a residential permit parking area shall be subjected to the parking regulations adopted as provided in this title as well as the penalties provided for herein.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon recommendation by the code compliance supervisor, the public safety commission may by resolution adopt regulations limiting the use of parking permits in an existing residential permit parking area to the parking of motor vehicles not more than two city blocks from the city block where the address for which the permit is issued is located. Such regulations may be adopted if the public safety commission finds that such limitation is necessary in order to decrease on-street parking congestion and effectively regulate residential permit parking. Upon adoption by the public safety commission of such regulations for an existing residential permit parking area, the code compliance supervisor shall cause written notification of such limitation, either by reissuance of permits or by other appropriate means, to be mailed to all persons holding parking permits for the residential permit parking area designated in the resolution. Following such notification, no motor vehicle on which is displayed a valid parking permit as provided for herein shall be permitted to stand or be parked in such residential permit parking area more than two city blocks from the city block where the address for which the permit has been issued is located. Such limitation may also be adopted when a new residential permit parking area is established by resolution of the public safety commission.

Permits may be renewed annually or for some other period of time as designated by the code compliance supervisor upon reapplication in the manner required by the code compliance supervisor.

It is a violation of this chapter, unless expressly provided to the contrary herein, for any person to stand or park a motor vehicle contrary to the parking regulations established pursuant hereto.

Such conduct shall constitute a violation of the chapter both by the person holding the valid parking permit and the person who so uses or displays the permit on a motor vehicle other than that for which it is issued. Upon conviction thereof, the person shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or be imprisoned for a period not exceeding six months, or both.

30.01.160 Revocation of permits.
     A.    The code compliance supervisor is authorized to revoke the residential parking permit of any person found to be in violation of this chapter and upon written notification thereof, the person shall surrender such permit to the code compliance supervisor. Failure, when so requested, to surrender a residential parking permit so revoked, shall constitute a violation of law and this chapter; and,

     B.     In the event a visitor permit is being used in a manner which violates this chapter, the code compliance supervisor may cancel the permit by issuing notice to the holder of the permit. In addition to canceling any visitor permit used in violation of this chapter, the code compliance supervisor may deny any further application for a visitor permit by any person for the residence in which such person resides as long as that person who used a visitor permit resides there.
