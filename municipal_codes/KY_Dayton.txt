payments will coincide with payment of ad valorem taxes.



   (B)   The amount of any outstanding assessment or installments
thereof on any property, and accrued interest and other charges, constitutes
a lien on the property to secure payment to the bondholders or any other
source of financing of the improvement.  The lien takes precedence over all
other liens, whether created prior to or subsequent to the publication of the
ordinance, except a lien for state and county taxes, general municipal taxes,
and prior improvement taxes, and is not defeated or postponed by any private
or judicial sale, by any mortgage, or by any error or mistake in the 
description of the property or in the names of the owners.  No error in the
proceedings of the Council shall  exempt  any benefited property from the
lien for the improvement assessment, or from payment thereof, or from the
penalties or interest thereon, as herein provided.

through 35.17 applies if additional property is included in the improvement
or if change is made in the method or period of financing; but additional
property may be included in the improvement with the consent of the owner
thereof without compliance with other sections if it does not increase the
cost apportioned  to  any  other property, or any other change may be made
without such compliance if all property owners of the improvement consent.

   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in
compliance with the open records law and the requested records are
immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection.  Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of
the City Clerk/Treasurer for the inspection.  No person shall remove
original copies of public records from the offices of any public agency
without the written permission of the official custodian of the record. 
(KRS 61.872(1).



   (C)   An applicant may inspect public records during the regular
business hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from
the city through the mail if the applicant’s residence or principle place
of business is outside of the county in which the city is located and he has
precisely described public records which are available within the city. If
the person requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed,
the official custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the
cost of mailing.  KRS 61.872(3).



   (D)   The applicant shall have  the right to make  abstracts of
the public records and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by
this chapter.  When copies are requested, the custodian may require a
written request and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
36.01.



   (E)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall
be available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public
records used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy
format where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. 
Agencies are not required to convert hard copy format records to electronic
formats.



   (F)   The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as
not less than 8½ inches × 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white
paper, or for electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard
Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format.  If the public agency
maintains electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this
format conforms to the requestor’s requirements, the public records may be
provided in this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified
by the public agency.  Any request for a public record in a form other than
the forms described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized
request.

   (G)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the
disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial
purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial
purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee.  The public
agency from which copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a
commercial purpose may require a certified statement form the requestor
stating the commercial purpose for which  they shall be used, and may
require the requestor to enter into a contract with the agency.  The
contract shall permit use of the public records for the stated commercial
purpose for a specified fee.  The fee may be based on the cost to the public
agency of media, mechanical processing and staff required to produce a copy
of the public record or records or the cost to the public agency of the
creation purchase, or the acquisition of the public records.



(KRS 61.874 (4))



   (H)   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part
of a public record for a:



      (1)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial
purpose, if a certified statement form the  requestor was required by the
public agency pursuant to subsection (G) of this section: or



      (2)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly
allows the use of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or



      (3)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly
allows the use of the public record for a commercial purpose.  A newspaper,
periodical, radio or television station shall not be held to have used or
knowingly allowed the use of the public record for a commercial purpose
merely because of its publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its
express permission for that commercial use.



(KRS 61.874 (5))



   (I)   Online access to public records in electronic form, as
provided under this section, may be provided and made available at the
discretion of the public agency.  If a party wishes to access public records
by electronic means and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a
public agency may require that the party enter into a contract, license, or
other agreement with the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements. 
Fees shall not exceed:



      (1)   The cost of physical connection to the system and
reasonable cost of computer time access charges;



      (2)   If the records are requested for a commercial purpose, a
reasonable fee based on the factors set forth in subsection (G).

§ 36.06  REFERRAL TO PROPER CUSTODIAN.



   If the City Clerk/Treasurer does not have custody or control of the
public record or records requested, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall so notify
the applicant and shall furnish the name and location of the custodian of the
public record.



(KRS 61.872(4))



§ 36.07  PUBLIC RECORDS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.



   If the public record is in active use, in storage, or not otherwise
available, the official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant
and shall designate a place, time, and date for inspection of the public
records, not to exceed three days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays) from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of
the cause is given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date
on which the public record will be available for inspection or duplication.



(KRS 61.872(5))



§ 36.08  REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.



   If the application places an unreasonable burden in producing public
records, or if the custodian has reason to believe that repeated requests are
intended to disrupt other essential functions of the public agency, the
official custodian may refuse to permit inspection of the public records or
mail copies of public records.  However, refusal under this section must be
sustained by clear and convincing evidence.  (KRS 61.872(6))



§ 36.09  TIME LIMITATION; DENIAL OF INSPECTION.



   (A)   The official custodian, upon any request for records made
under this chapter, shall determine within three (3) days, excepting
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request
whether to comply with the request and shall notify in writing the person
making the request within the three-day period of its decision.  Any agency
response denying, in whole or in part, inspection of any record shall include
a statement of the specific exception authorizing the  withholding  of 
the  record and  a  brief  explanation of how the exception applies to
the record withheld.  The response shall be issued by the official custodian
or under the official custodian’s authority and shall constitute final
agency action.



(KRS 61.880)



   (B)   If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review
the denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed
under the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882.  Upon the Attorney
General’s request, the agency will provide additional documentation.



   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney
General reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole
or in part, the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute
appeal proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory
relief in the circuit court.  In addition, if the Attorney General disallows
the request, or if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding
the Attorney General’s opinion, and the person seeking disclosure
institutes proceedings in circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney
General of such action.  (KRS 61.880, 61.882)



§ 36.10  CONCEALING OR DESTROYING RECORDS PROHIBITED.

nature where the public disclosure thereof would constitute a clearly

however, apply to records the disclosure or publication of which is directed

entity that disclosed the records.



         (b)   Upon and after July 15, 1992, records
confidentially disclosed to an agency or required by an agency to be

in administrative adjudication that were compiled in the process of detecting

prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication.  Unless
exempted by other provisions of this chapter, public records exempted under
this provision shall be open after enforcement action is completed or a

property, said owner shall notify the City Administrator and Blight
Administrator, who shall, if they find the property is no longer abandoned
urban property, notify the City Clerk/Treasurer and the Campbell County
Property Valuation Administrator to strike the property from the list of
abandoned properties as of the succeeding January 1.



   (E)   No later than January 15 of each year the City Administrator

opportunity for a hearing. If the Dayton Code Enforcement Board finds the
property was incorrectly classified as abandoned urban property, it shall

   (A)   Green alone or “Go”:  Vehicular traffic facing the signal
may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such
place prohibits either such turn.  However, vehicular traffic shall yield
the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection at the time such signal is exhibited.



   (B)   Steady yellow alone or “Caution” when shown following the
green or “Go” signal:  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal
is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that
a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular
traffic shall not enter the intersection.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady
yellow signal may enter and clear the intersection.

facing the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an
intersection or at such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible

§ 91.21  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ANIMAL OWNERS; ENFORCEMENT OF
RESTRICTIONS.



   (A)   Responsibility of all animal owners.  It shall be the duty of
every owner of any animal, or anyone having an animal in his possession or
custody, to exercise reasonable care and to take all necessary steps and
precautions to protect other people, property, and animals from injuries or
damages which might result from their animal’s behavior, regardless of
whether such behavior is motivated by mischievousness, playfulness, or
ferocity.



   (B)   Parent or guardian liability.  In the event the owner or
keeper of any animal is a minor, the parent or guardian of such minor shall
be responsible to insure that all provisions of this subchapter are complied
with.



   (C)   Duty to keep animal under restraint while on owner, possessor,
or custodian’s property.  It shall be the duty of every owner of any
animal, or anyone having any animal in his possession or custody, to insure
that the animal is kept under restraint and that reasonable care and
precautions are taken to prevent the animal from leaving, while unattended,
the real property limits of its owner, possessor, or custodian, and that it
is securely and humanely enclosed within a house, building, fence, pen, or
other enclosure out of which it cannot climb, dig, jump or otherwise escape
on its own volition. Such enclosure must be securely locked at any time the
animal is left unattended, or it must be securely and humanely restrained by
chain, cable, and trolley, or other tether of sufficient strength to prevent
escape, or it must be on a leash under the control of a competent person.



   (D)   Additional requirements for precautions that must be taken by
owners of dangerous animals.  Whenever outside of its enclosure as provided

by the owner and restrained by a secure collar and leash of sufficient
strength to prevent its escape. No dangerous animal shall be chained,
tethered, or otherwise tied to any inanimate object, such as a tree, post, or
building outside of its own enclosure as provided herein.  Owners of
dangerous animals who maintain their animal out of doors, must have a portion
of their property fenced with a perimeter  or  area  fence. Within  this
perimeter fence, the dangerous animal must be humanely confined inside a pen
or kennel of adequate size.  The pen or kennel may not share common fencing
with the area or perimeter fence.  The kennel or fence must have secure
sides, a secure top attached to all sides, the sides must either be buried
two (2) feet into the ground, sunken into a concrete pad, or securely
attached to a wire bottom.  The gate to the kennel must be locked.



   (E)   Duty to keep animal under restraint while off property.  It
shall be the duty of the owner of any animal or anyone having an animal in
his possession to keep the animal under restraint and in control at all times
while the animal is off the real property limits of the owner, possessor, or
custodian.  For purposes of this section, the animal is deemed under control
when, it is securely confined within a vehicle parked or in motion, or it is
properly confined within a secure enclosure with the permission of the owner
of the property where the enclosure is located, or it is securely restrained
by a leash or other device held by a competent person.



   (F)   Additional requirements that must be taken by owners of
dangerous animals.  Except when being transported in, and securely confined
within, a vehicle, no dangerous animal shall be permitted off the property of
his owner except when it is attended by its owner, and is restrained by a
secure collar and leash (not to exceed six (6) feet in length), both collar
and leash to be of sufficient strength to prevent escape, and muzzled by
sufficient means to prevent its biting other persons or domestic animals.



   (G)   Enforcement of restrictions on dangerous animals.



      (1)   In the event that any law enforcement officer has
probably cause to believe that a dangerous animal is being harbored in
violation of this subchapter he may:



         (a)   Order the violation immediately corrected and cite
the owner or keeper to appear in court for the violation, or



         (b)   If the violation cannot be immediately corrected
and the animal is posing an imminent serious threat to human beings or other
domestic animals, the animal may be seized and impounded, in which case the
owner or keeper will be cited to appear in court for the violation.  At the
owner’s request and expense, such impoundment may be at a veterinarian or
licensed kennel of the owner’s choosing.  If the court rules that the
animal is not dangerous as defined, it will be released to the owner.  If
the court rules that it is dangerous as defined, the animal will be released
to the owner after payment of any fees and penalties, and upon presentation
of proof that the animal will now be kept restrained or confined as specified
in this subchapter.



      (2)   If the owner or keeper of any alleged dangerous animal
impounded for violation of this subchapter presents proof that the animal
will not be kept in compliance with this subchapter, the animal will be
released upon payment of any fees and penalties due.



      (3)   If the owner or keeper of an alleged dangerous animal
fails to either provide proof that the animal will now be kept restrained or
confined in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, or fails to
reclaim it after impoundment, and if it cannot be adopted by someone
providing proof that it will be kept restrained or confined as specified in
this subchapter, it will be humanely euthanized.



   (H)   Warning signs.  All owners, keepers, or harborers of any
guard dog or dangerous animal shall display in a prominent place on their
premises, and at each entrance or exit to the area where such animal is
confined, a sign easily readable by the public using the words “Beware of
Dangerous Animal” or “Beware of Dog”.

dangerous animal, or anyone on behalf of such person, may make a complaint
before the Dangerous Animal Officer or District Court, charging the owner,
possessor, or custodian of such animal with harboring a dangerous animal.  A
copy of such complaint shall be served upon the person so charged in the same
manner and subject to the laws regulating the service of summons in civil
cases, or by any law enforcement officer of the city with a return receipt,
directing such person to appear before the District Court for a hearing of
such complaint at a time fixed.  If upon a hearing of the parties and their
witnesses, the court finds the person so charged is the owner, possessor, or
guardian of the animal in question, and that such animal has without cause,
pursued, wounded, or attacked a human being or other domestic animal, the
court shall declare such animal a dangerous animal and order the owner,
possessor, or guardian to henceforth keep such dangerous animal securely
confined as set forth herein, and impose the penalties set forth in §
91.99.

hereof, the court shall order the owner, possessor, or guardian of said
dangerous animal to immediately remove the animal from the city or order the
animal humanely euthanized.

PROHIBITED ANIMALS



§ 91.30  FINDINGS.



   (A)   The City of Dayton is an urban area with a population living
in close proximity to each other and extensive vehicular traffic.



   (B)   The urban character of the community and the health and safety
of its citizens requires that livestock, poultry and undomesticated and
exotic animals, reptiles or fish be prohibited from the territorial limits of
the city.



   (C)   The keeping of livestock and poultry creates noxious and
hazardous odors and can cause the spread of disease and attracts vexatious
and disease carrying insects and varmints which are detrimental to the health
and safety of the public.



   (D)   The keeping of undomesticated and exotic animals, reptiles or
fish, in addition to creating the same noxious and hazardous conditions
associated with livestock and poultry, creates dangerous and unsafe
conditions to persons residing in proximity to such animals due to attacks,
bites, clawing, and other activities which are instinctive to such animals.



   (E)   The keeping of livestock, poultry, undomesticated and exotic
animals, reptiles or fish within an urban setting constitutes cruelty to such
animals in that said animals require large spaces for their habitats, are
instinctively wary of human contact, and are oblivious to the dangers of
urban life such as vehicular traffic.

other tree on public property.  Topping is defined as the severe cutting
back of limbs to stubs larger than three (3) inches in diameter within the

overhanging any street or right-of-way within the city shall prune the
branches so that such branches shall not obstruct the light from any street
lamp or obstruct the view of any street intersection and so that there shall
be a clear space of eight (8) feet above the surface of the street or
sidewalk.  Owners shall remove all dead, diseased, or dangerous trees or
broken or decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the safety of the
public.  The city shall have the right to prune any trees or shrub on
private property when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the
street from a street light or interferes with visibility of any traffic
control device or sign.



   (C)   Dead or diseased tree removal on private property.  The city
shall have the right to cause the removal of any dead or diseased trees on
private property with the city when such trees constitute a hazard to life
and property, or harbor insects or disease which constitute a potential
threat to other trees within the city.  The City Tree Board will notify in
writing the owners of such trees.  Removal shall be done by owners  at
their own expense within sixty (60) days after the date of service of
notice.  In the event of failure of owners to comply with such provisions,
the city shall have the authority to remove such trees and charge the cost of
removal on the owner’s property tax notice.

license fee shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) annually in advance

company or city employee doing such work in the pursuit of their public
service endeavors.  Before any license shall be issued, each applicant shall

   (A)   Demolition orders generally. A Code Enforcement Officer shall
order the owner of a premises to demolish and remove a structure located
thereon, or if such structure is capable of being made safe by repairs, to
repair and make safe and sanitary or to demolish and remove at the owners
option, when, in the opinion of the Code Enforcement Officer:



      (1)   Imminent danger exists on the subject property that
necessitates immediate action, or there is reason to believe that the
existence of a violation of this Chapter with respect to the structure
presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare; or



      (2)   The structure is so old, dilapidated, or has become so
out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for
human habitation or occupancy, or demolition is otherwise reasonably
necessary to protect the public interest.



   (B)   Order. The order shall specify necessary repairs, if any, and
a time in which the owner shall comply therewith, which shall be no less than
30 days unless an emergency exists pursuant to section (A)(1). It shall be
served on the owner of record in accordance with this chapter.



   (C)   Hearing prior to demolition by city.



      (1)   Except when an imminent danger exists that will not
permit delay, whenever the owner of a property fails to comply with a

officer and shall conduct a hearing prior to the city undertaking demolition
of the structure.

evidence that demolition is authorized by division (A).



      (4)   The property owner may waive his or her right to a

owner’s failure to appear at the hearing after proper notice shall
constitute a waiver, unless good cause is shown.



      (5)   Upon a showing by substantial evidence that demolition
of the structure is authorized by division (A), or upon waiver of hearing by
the property owner, the hearing officer shall enter an order to that effect

      (6)   The order shall be served on the owner of record and any
lien holder of record within fourteen (14) days of the final determination,

record, that lien holder may, within forty-five (45) days from the receipt of
that notice, correct the violations cited or elect to pay all fines, penalty
charges, and costs incurred in remedying the situation as permitted.



      (7)   Anyone affected by an order issued pursuant to division
(C)(5) may, after service of such order, apply to Campbell Circuit Court for
an order restraining the Code Enforcement Officer from razing such structure.



   (D)   Demolition by city. Upon final determination that the
structure shall be demolished by the city, or when an imminent danger exists
that will not permit the delay associated with a hearing, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall cause the structure to be razed and removed, either
through an available public agency or by contract or arrangement with private
persons, and the cost of such razing and removal, together with related
expenses, costs, fees, and attorney fees to the extent provided by law, shall
be charged against the owner of the real estate upon which the structure is
located. Upon failure of the owner to effect payment of such costs, a lien
shall be placed by the city against the real estate upon which the razed or
removed structure was located pursuant to § 99.99.



   (E)   Appeals. Any person directly affected by an order under this
section shall have the right to appeal to the Code Enforcement Board within

Code Enforcement Board, in order to abate any condition described by this
section. The Code Enforcement Officer shall not be precluded from pursuing

the city of any change in address, the cessation of business or any other
changes that render the information supplied to the city in the license
application inaccurate.

§ 110.04  APPORTIONMENT.



   (A)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, gross
receipts shall be apportioned as follows:



      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales
revenue in more than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the gross receipts
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in
division (B) of this section, plus the sales factor, described in division
(C) of this section, and the denominator of which is two (2); and



      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than
one (1) tax district, by multiplying the gross receipts by the sales factor
as set forth in division (C) of this section.



      (3)   For the purpose of divisions (A) through (E) of this
section, the business entity shall file an apportionment form provided by the
city.



   (B)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is
the total amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the
business entity for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total
compensation paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax
period. Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the
individual’s service is performed within the city.



   (C)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
total sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period,
and the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business
entity everywhere during the tax period.



      (1)   The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property
is in the city if:



         (a)   The property is deEvered or shipped to a
purchaser, other than the United States government, or to the designee of the
purchaser within the city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions
of the sale; or



         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store,
warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser
is the United States government.



      (2)   Sales revenue, other than revenues from the sale, lease
or rental of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real
property, are apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of
which is the time spent in performing such income-producing activity within
the city and the denominator of which is the total time spent, performing
that income-producing activity.



      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real
property is allocated to the tax district where the property is located.



   (D)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity’s activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity’s business activity, if reasonable:



      (1)   Separate accounting;



      (2)   The exclusion of anyone (1) or more of the factors;



      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors
which will fairly represent the business entity’s business activity in the
city; or



      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an
equitable allocation and apportionment of gross receipts.



   (E)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or
payable as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the
city. The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage that the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this
subsection, the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.



   (F)   All partnerships, S-corporations, and all other entities where
income is “passed through” to the owners are subject to this chapter. The
occupational license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income
before it is “passed throughl' these entities to the owners.



   (G)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or
withdraws from the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in
any manner surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the
dissolution, cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of
charter shall not defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and
collection of any occupational license tax for the period of that taxable
year during which the business entity had business activity in the city.



   (H)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal
income tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the
purposes of this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year
required by the federal government, and shall employ the same methods of
accounting required for federal income tax purposes.

§ 110.05  EMPLOYERS TO WITHHOLD.



   (A)   Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee
shall deduct and withhold upon the payment of the compensation an
occupational license tax calculated under § 110.03 imposed against the
compensation and wages earned in the city. Amounts withheld shall be paid to
the city in accordance with this chapter.



   (B)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this
section shall, for the quarter ending after January 1 and for each quarter
ending thereafter, on or before the end of the month following the close of
each quarter, make a return and report to the city, and pay to the city, the
tax required to be withheld under this section, unless the employer is
permitted or required to report within a reasonable time after some other
period as determined by the city.



   (C)   Every employer who fails to withhold or pay to the city any
sums required by this chapter to be withheld and paid shall be personally and
individually liable to the city for any sum or sums withheld or required to
be withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section.



   (D)   The city shall have a lien upon all the property of any
employer who fails to withhold or pay over to the city sums required to be
withheld under this section. If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the
amounts withheld to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the
amounts withheld were required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails
to withhold, the lien shall commence at the time the liability of the
employer is assessed by the city.



   (E)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this
section shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and
file on a form furnished or approved by the city a reconciliation of the
occupational license tax withheld where compensation is paid or payable to
employees. Either copies of federal forms W-2 and W-3, transmittal of wage
and tax statements, or a detailed employee listing with the required
equivalent information, as determined by the city, shall be submitted.



   (F)   Every employer shall furnish each employee a statement on or
before January 31 of each year showing the amount of compensation and
occupational license tax deducted by the employer from the compensation paid
to the employee for payment to the city during the preceding calendar year.



   (G)   An employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax
required to be deducted and withheld under this section.



   (H)   The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or any
other person holding an equivalent corporate office of any business entity
subject to this section shall be personally and individually liable, both
jointly and severally, for any tax required to be withheld from compensation
paid or payable to one or more employees of the business entity, and neither
the corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the City,
nor the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that
liability; provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to
each and every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax
becomes or became obligated. No person shall be personally and individually
liable under this section unless such person had authority to collect,
truthfully account for, or pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the
time that the taxes imposed by this chapter become or became due.



   (I)   Not withstanding divisions (G) and (H) of this section, every
employee receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under
§ 110.03 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all cases where
the employer does not withhold the tax levied under this chapter from the
employee, such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing with the
city each quarter in the same manner as if they were the employer or as
otherwise required by the city. If an employer fails to or is not required to
withhold, report, or pay the license tax it shall become the duty of the
employee to file with the City. The only employer that is not required to
withhold, report, and pay the occupational license tax is the federal
government including the United States Postal Service. The payment required
to be made by an employee can be made quarterly, for the periods ending March
31, June 31, September 30, and December 31 of each year, or at anytime the
employee wishes to make an estimated payment for the year in which wages are
earned. All license fees must be received by February 28 for the preceding
calendar year, together with a copy of the employee’s W-2 form. Employers
not required to withhold, report, or pay the license tax must annually,
during the month of January of each year, make a return to the city, in which
is set forth the name and social security number of each employee of the
employer during the preceding calendar year, giving the amount of salaries,
wages, commissions, or other compensation earned during such preceding year
by each such employee. This list shall include all current fu11-time
employees, part time employees, temporary employees, and terminated employees
whether it be voluntary or involuntary.

§ 110.06  RETURNS REQUIRED.



   (A)   All business entity returns for the preceding taxable year
shall be made by April 15 of each year, except returns made on the basis of a
fiscal year, which shall be made by the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth
(4th) month following the close of the fiscal year. Blank forms for returns
shall be supplied by the city or standard forms provided by the Kentucky
Secretary of State.



   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal
income tax return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of
filing its occupational license tax return with the City. Whenever, in the
opinion of the city, it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return
of any business entity in order to audit the return, the city may compel the
business entity to produce for inspection a copy of any statements and
schedules in support thereof that have not been previously filed. The city
may also require copies of reports of adjustments made by the federal
government.



   (C)   Every business entity subject to an occupational license tax
governed by the provisions of this chapter shall keep records, render under
oath statements, make returns, and comply with rules as the city from time to
time may prescribe. Whenever the city deems it necessary, the city may
require a business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to make a
return, render statements under oath, or keep records, as the city deems
sufficient to determine the tax liability of the business entity.



   (D)   The city may require, for the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the
taxable income of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of
the business entity or of any other person having knowledge on the premises.



   (E)   The full amount of the unpaid tax payable by any business
entity, as appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the city at
the time prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return,
determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return.



   (F)   Every business entity making payments of six hundred dollars
($600.00) or more to persons other than employees for services performed
within the city is responsible for maintaining the records of those payments
and for completing IRS Form 1099 on or before February 28 of the year
following the close of the calendar year in which such compensation was paid
and to remit copies of the IRS Form 1099 or equivalent information to the
city on or before February 28 of each year.

§ 110.07  EXTENSIONS.



   (A)   The city may grant any business entity an extension of not
more than six (6) months, unless a longer extension has been granted by the
Internal Revenue Service or is agreed to by the city and the business entity,
for filing its return, if the business entity, on or before the date
prescribed for payment of the occupational license tax, requests in writing
the extension and pays the amount properly estimated as its tax. Extension
request forms shall be supplied by the city.



   (B)   If the time for filing a return is extended, the business
entity shall pay, as part of the tax, an amount equal to twelve percent (12%)
per annum simple interest on the tax shown due on the return, but not been
previously paid, from the time the tax was due until the return is actually
filed and the tax paid to the city. A fraction of a month is counted as an
entire month.



(Ord. 2017-21, passed 12-5-17)



§ 110.08 REFUNDS.



   (A)   Where there has been an overpayment of tax under § 110.05, a
refund or credit shall be made to the employer only to the extent that the
amount of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld under § 110.05 by
the employer. Unless a written application for refund or credit is received
by the city from the employer within two (2) years from the date the
overpayment was made no refund or credit shall be allowed. Where there has
been an overpayment of the maximum tax due under § 110.05, a refund or
credit shall be made to the employee to the extent of overpayment only if a
written application for refund is received by the city from the employer or
the employee within two years from the date the overpayment was made. All
written applications for refunds shall be submitted to the city on a form
furnished or approved by the city. Refunds may be withheld from an employee
until the employer has filed all required forms and provided all required
information to the city. Overpayments of less than five dollars ($5.00) shall
not be refunded.



   (B)   An employee who has compensation attributable to activities
performed outside the city, based on time spent outside the City, whose
employer has withheld and remitted to this city, the occupational license tax
on the compensation attributable to activities performed outside the city,
may file for a refund within two (2) years of the date prescribed by law for
the filing of a return. The employee shall provide a schedule and computation
sufficient to verify the refund claim and the city may confirm with the
employer the percentage of time spent outside the city and the amount of
compensation attributable to activities performed outside the city prior to
approval of the refund.



   (C)   Where there has been an overpayment of tax under § 110.03, a
refund or credit shall be made to any person or business entity to the extent
of overpayment only if a written application for refund or credit is received
by the city from the person or business entity within two (2) years from the
date the overpayment was made. No refund shall be made of any tax paid unless
a complete return is filed as required by § 110.03.



(Ord. 2017-21, passed 12-5-17)



§ 110.09  FEDERAL AUDIT PROVISIONS.



   (A)   As soon as practicable after each return is received, the city
may examine and audit the return. If the amount of tax computed by the city
is greater than the amount returned by the business entity, the additional
tax shall be assessed and a notice of assessment mailed to the business
entity by the city within five (5) years from the date the return was filed,
except as otherwise provided in this subsection.



      (1)   In the case of a failure to file a return or of a
fraudulent return the additional tax may be assessed at anytime.



      (2)   In the case of a return where a business entity
understates gross receipts, or omits an amount properly includable in gross
receipts, or both, which understatement or omission, or both, is in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of gross receipts stated in the
return, the additional tax maybe assessed at anytime within six (6) years
after the return was filed.



      (3)   In the case of an assessment of additional tax relating
directly to adjustments resulting from a final determination of a federal
audit, the additional tax may be assessed before the expiration of the times
provided in this subsection, or six (6) months from the date the city
receives the final determination of the federal audit from the business
entity, whichever is later.



      (4)   The times provided in this subsection may be extended by
agreement between the business entity and the city. For the purposes of this
subsection, a return filed before the last day prescribed bylaw for filing
the return shall be considered as filed on the last day. Any extension
granted for filing the return shall also be considered as extending the last
day prescribed by law for filing the return.



   (B)   Every business entity shall submit a copy of the final
determination of the federal audit within thirty (30) days of the conclusion
of the federal audit.

   (A)   No suit shall be maintained in any court to restrain or delay
the collection or payment of any tax levied by this chapter.



   (B)   Any tax collected pursuant to the provisions of this chapter
may be refunded or credited within two (2) years of the date prescribed by
law for the filing of a return or the date the money was paid to the city,
whichever is the later, except that:



      (1)   In any case where the assessment period contained in §
110.09 has been extended by an agreement between the business entity and the
city, the limitation contained in this subsection shall be extended

claim for refund or credit within the time provided for in this section or
six (6) months from the conclusion of the federal audit, whichever is later.



   (C)   For the purposes of this subsection and division (D) of this
section, a return filed before the last day prescribed by law for filing the
return shall be considered as filed on the last day.

acquired by him or her of the affairs of any person, or information regarding
the tax schedules, returns, or reports required to be filed with the tax
district or other proper officer, or any information produced by a hearing or
investigation, insofar as the information may have to do with the affairs of
the person’s business. This prohibition does not extend to information
required in prosecutions for making false reports or returns for taxation, or
any other infraction of the tax laws, or in any way made a matter of public
record, nor does it preclude furnishing any taxpayer or the taxpayer’s
properly authorized agent with information respecting his or her own return.

testifying in any court, or from introducing as evidence returns or reports
filed with the tax district, in an action for violation of the Qt/s tax laws
or in any action challenging the city’s tax laws.



   (B)   The city reserves the right to disclose to the Commissioner of
Revenue of the state or his or her duly authorized agent all such information

to obtain information form the files and records of the Kentucky Revenue
Cabinet and maintains the privileged character of the information so
furnished. Provided, further, that the city may publish statistics based on
such information in such a manner as not to reveal data respecting gross
receipts or compensation of any person or business entity.



   (C)   In addition, the city is empowered to execute similar
reciprocity agreements as described in division (B) of this section with any
other taxing entity, should there be a need for exchange of information in
order to effect diligent enforcement of this chapter.



   (D)   Any person violating the provisions of this section by

      (1)   “DWELLING UNIT.” Any group of rooms located within a
building or structure, including mobile homes, and forming a single
housekeeping unit with facilities which are used or designed to be used for
living, sleeping, cooking or eating.



      (2)   “DWELLING.”  Any building which contains one or
more dwelling  units or any rooming unit,  rooms or area designated or 
used for sleeping purposes either as a primary use or use on casual
occasions. “DWELLING” shall also include a rooming house, motels, tourist
homes, school dormitories, and apartment buildings.



      (3)   “OWNER.”  Any corporation, company, partnership or
other association or any natural person, who, alone, jointly, or with several
others shall:



         (a)   Have all or part of the legal title to any
dwelling or dwelling unit, with or without accompanying actual possession
thereof, or shall have all or part of the beneficial ownership of any
dwelling unit and a right to present use and enjoyment thereof, including a
mortgage in possession; or



         (b)   Have charge, care, or control of any dwelling or
dwelling unit as owner, executor, administrator, trustee, guardian of the
estate, or duly authorized agent of the owner.  Any such person thus
representing the actual owner shall be bound to comply with the owner’s
obligations under this section.



      (4)   “ROOMING UNIT.”  Any room which is designed or used
for sleeping purposes.  A “ROOMING UNIT” may also include a room in a
rooming house, a hotel, a motel, a tourist home, a school dormity, or an
apartment building which may, or may not have some additional facilities for
eating or cooking contained therein.



   (B)   (1)   Subject to such exceptions and conditions for
compliance as stated herein, six months after the effective date of this
section, smoke detectors shall be required in all dwellings privately owned
or rented for occupancy.  It shall be the responsibility of the owner of
each new and/or existing occupied dwelling unit to install smoke detectors in
each dwelling unit as hereinafter provided.  Said smoke detectors shall be
capable of sensing visible or invisible particles or combustion and providing
a suitable audible (or visual for a deaf or hearing impaired person) alarm.



      (2)   This section shall apply to any and all dwellings or
dwelling units, new or existing, which are not otherwise required to have
smoke detectors located herein under the provisions of the currently adopted
Kentucky Building Code and/or the currently adopted Life Safety Code (LSC
101).



   (C)   (1)   In order to comply with this section, only ionization
or photoelectric-type detectors approved by a nationally recognized testing
laboratory shall be installed.  As an alternative to self- contained smoke
detectors, under certain limited conditions, an approved fire-detection
system or a combination thereof may be installed.  Each and every
alternative system must be individually approved in written form by the Fire
Chief or the Chief Fire Inspector of the City Fire Department.



      (2)   Smoke detectors in new residential dwellings shall be
wired directly (hard wired) to the building.  In existing buildings, it is
preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to the power supply;
however, said detectors may be powered by self-monitored battery or operated
by an electrical plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer
device, provided that the outlet is not controlled by any switch other than
the main power supply.



      (3)   Smoke detectors shall be placed in accordance with
applicable National Fire Protection Act (N.F.P.A.) Standards.  Detectors may

Where bedrooms or rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other
use areas (such as kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets),
they shall be considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this
section.  In a dwelling unit which contains a well defined sleeping room
separated from the other activity areas of the same unit, the detectors shall
be located in the corridor within the unit or interior area giving access to
the rooms used for sleeping purposes.  Where sleeping areas are separated
and/or where a single smoke detector will not adequately service all sleeping
areas, there shall be a smoke detector installed adjacent to each sleeping
area.



      (5)   In a rooming unit, the detector shall be centrally
located on the ceiling.



      (6)   In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or
any rooming unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke
detectors in each dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in
centrally located common areas, so that smoke detectors will adequately
service all sleeping areas.



      (7)   At least one detector shall be installed in or near each
stairway leading up to an occupied area in such a manner as to assure that
rising smoke is not obstructed in reaching the detector and the detector
intercepts rising smoke before it reaches the occupied area.



   (D)   (1)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for
supplying and installing in an operable condition the required detector(s)
and for providing maintenance and testing in an owner- occupied residence; or
for providing the manufacturer’s maintenance and testing instructions to a
tenant in the case of rental property.



      (2)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for
maintenance and testing of detectors, in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions, which are located in common areas and/or detectors in rooming
units where the tenant usually has short periods of occupancy (hotels,
motels, rooming or tourist homes).



      (3)   The tenant shall be responsible for maintaining and
testing the detector, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions,
which are within his or her exclusive control during the life of the
tenancy.  The tenant shall be responsible for notifying the owner when a
detector becomes inoperable, whereafter the owner has ten days in which to
repair or replace in operable condition said detector(s).  In the
battery-operated detectors, battery replacement shall be the responsibility
of the tenant.



      (4)   At every change of tenancy, it shall be the duty of the
owner to test and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in
operable condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing
them in operable condition.



      (5)   At every change of occupancy of every dwelling unit
occasioned by or incidental to a sale, lease or sublease of said unit, it
shall be the duty of the grantor thereof (i.e., the seller, lessor, or
sublessor, as the case may be) to provide, before occupancy by the new
occupant thereof, that all smoke detectors which are required by this section
(and other applicable laws) are installed and in proper working condition. 
Failure to comply with this division shall be punishable as set forth herein,
provided, however, that this division shall not be construed to violate or
render void any contract, lease or sublease subject hereto.



      (6)   No smoke detector or alternative system shall be
directly connected (permanently wired) to the electrical system of a
structure without the proper electrical certification.



   (E)   This section is intended to be used with, and supplemented by,
the applicable provisions of the National Fire Protection Standards 72-E and
74 (current edition) which are hereby incorporated herein; however, if there
shall be any conflict between this section and the said supplemental
standards, this section and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant
thereto shall pervail.  All amendments to or changes in N.F.P.A.  Nos. 72-E
and 74 are adopted and made a part hereof without further reference.



   (F)   (1)   The Fire Chief or the Fire Inspector of the City Fire
Department shall be primarily responsible for the enforcement of this section.



      (2)   The City Inspector shall assist the Fire Chief by making
referrals to the Fire Chief as part of its regular inspection and enforcement
of all city housing, building and safety codes.  No building permits for
remodeling or repair of a dwelling unit shall be issued for any dwelling unit
not properly equipped with said detectors.  No certificate of occupancy
shall be issued for any new dwelling or dwelling unit not properly equipped
with said detectors.  Detectors must be operable for the final inspection of
the City Inspector and the Fire Chief.  Instructions/maintenance booklets
must be provided to the owner by the manufacturer as per N.F.P.A. No. 74, and
said documentation displayed to the City Inspector or Fire Chief during the
final inspection.

division (A) above upon written determination that such requirement is
unreasonable due to design, geographical abnormalities, adequate substitute
accommodations, cost or for other good cause shown.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 152.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has, in KRS Chapter
100, delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the City Council hereby adopts the following floodplain
management regulations as set forth in this chapter.



(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 1, § A, passed 9-5-06)



§ 152.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, causing increased flood height and velocity, and
by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage.



(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 1, § B, passed 9-5-06)



§ 152.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding
by provisions designed to:



   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;



   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood
waters;



   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase erosion or flood damage; and



   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to
other areas.



(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 1, § C, passed 9-5-06)



§ 152.04  OBJECTIVES.



   The objectives of this chapter are to:



   (A)   Protect human life and health;



   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;



   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;



   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood- prone areas
in such a manner as to minimize future flood-blighted areas caused by
flooding;



   (G)   Ensure that potential home buyers are on notice that property
is in a special flood hazard area; and



   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area
assume responsibility for their actions.



(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 1, § D, passed 9-5-06)



§ 152.05  DEFINITIONS.



   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.



   “A ZONE.”  Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in
which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or
a combination of both. In A Zones, flood waters may move slowly or rapidly,
but waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of
100-year flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not
determined.



   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).”  A structure
located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure, the use of
which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory
structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used
for human habitation, and should be designed to have minimal flood damage
potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports,
storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.



   “ACCESSORY USE.”  A use which is incidental and subordinate to the
principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected
by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed
addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent
perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.



   “A99 ZONE.”  That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood

chance flood (100-year) flood. Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined.



   “AH ZONE.”  An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are
between one and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations
are shown.



   “AO ZONE.”  An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth
is between one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood
depths are shown.



   “APPEAL.”  A request for a review of the Floodplain
Administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the
Floodplain Administrator’s ruling on a request for a variance.

flood hazard areas (SFHAs) that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is in the process of being
restored to provide a 100-year or greater level of flood protection. After
restoration is complete these areas will still experience residual flooding
from other flooding sources.

community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths
range from one to three feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path
of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.



   “BASE FLOOD.”  A flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (also called the “100-year flood”). Base flood
is the term used throughout this chapter.



   “BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).”  The elevation shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, Al-30, AR, AR/IA, AR/AE,
AR/Al-A30, AR/AH, and AR/AO that indicates the water surface elevation
resulting from a flood that has a 1% or greater chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.



   “BASEMENT.”  Any area of a structure having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.



   “BUILDING.”  See definition for “structure.”



   “COMMUNITY.”  A political entity having the authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.

determined by the Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated,
or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical
information, and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject
to periodic inundation by flood waters that can adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams.



   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).”  A program developed by the
Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities
in the regular program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures for protection from flooding.



   “CRITICAL FACILITY.”  Any property that, if flooded, would result
in severe consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if
unusable or unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely
affect the health and safety of the public. Critical facilities include, but
are not limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently
mobile to avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing
homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle
and equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be
called upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility
facilities important to maintaining or restoring normal services before,
during and after a flood, and those facilities or installations which
produce, use or store volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-
reactive materials, hazardous materials or hazardous waste.



   “D ZONE.”  An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.

   “EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.”  A manufactured
home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before the effective date of the first floodplain management
ordinance adopted by a community.



   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” 
The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed,
including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.

      (4)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a
lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by
waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly
caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water,
accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such
as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and
unforeseeable event which results in flooding.



   “FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM).”  A map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) has delineated the areas of flood
hazards and the regulatory floodway.



   “FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).”  A map on which the boundaries
of the flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having
special hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).



   “FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).”  A map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated special flood hazard areas
and risk premium zones.



   “FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY.”  The report provided by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) containing flood profiles, the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), and/or the Flood Boundary Floodway Map (FBFM), and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.



   “FLOODPLAIN” or “FLOOD-PRONE AREA.”  Any land area susceptible
to being inundated by flood waters from any source.



   “FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.”  The individual appointed by a
community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.



   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.”  The operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving
and enhancing natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
ordinances, and open space plans.



   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.”  This chapter and other
zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health
regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion
control), and other applications of police power, which control development
in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state and/or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.



   “FLOODPROOFING.”  Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation
facilities, structures, and their contents.



   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.”  A certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the
time of certification, stating that a nonresidential structure, together with
attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to a specified
design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage
of water, and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and
anticipated debris impact forces.



   “FLOODWAY.”  The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than
one foot. Also referred to as the “regulatory floodway.”

the regulatory floodway.



   “FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION.”  As related in § 152.52, Appeals and
variance procedures, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on
or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the Board of
Adjustments will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure
adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for
50 to 100 years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the
base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of
damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as
a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering
that those increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may
purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage,
and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.



   “FREEBOARD.”  A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above
the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is
used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to
flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard
must be applied not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofing level, but also to the level of protection provided to all
components of the structure, such as building utilities, HVAC components, and
the like.



   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE FACILITY.”  A facility, structure, or
other development which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is
located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a
docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or
passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term
storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.



   “GOVERNING BODY.”  The local governing unit, i.e. the city that is
empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public health,
safety and general welfare of its citizenry.



   “HAZARD POTENTIAL.”  The possible adverse incremental consequences
that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a
dam or misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential
classification of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of
a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity,
flood-routing capacity).



   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.”  The highest natural elevation of the
ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.



   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.”  Any structure that is:



      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic
Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;



      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary
of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a
registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the
Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;



      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic
places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved
by the Secretary of the Interior; or



      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic
places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been
certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary
of the Interior, or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states
without approved programs.



   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).”  Increased cost of
compliance coverage means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost
to repair a substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal
repair cost and that is required to being a substantially damaged building
into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable
mitigation measures are floodproofing (nonresidential), relocation,
elevation, demolition, or any combination thereof. ICC coverage is available
on residential and non-residential buildings (this category includes public
or government buildings, such as schools, libraries, and municipal buildings)
insured under the NFIP.



   “LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).”  An official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs include the
following categories:



      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on
technical data showing that a property was inadvertently included in a
designated SFHA. An LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes
that a specific property is not located in an SFHA.



      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on
technical data that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood
zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and
planimetric features.



      (3)   Letter of Map Revision – Based on Fill (LOMR F).  A
determination that a structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed
engineered fill above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA.



   “LEVEE.”  A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment,
designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to
contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection
from temporary flooding.



   “LEVEE SYSTEM.”  A flood protection system that consists of a
levee or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage
devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound
engineering practices.



   “LIMITED STORAGE.”  An area used for storage and intended to be
limited to incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and
have low flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood-resistant
material, void of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be
temperature controlled.



   “LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE.”  The lowest elevation of the sidewalk,
patio, attached garage, deck support, or basement entryway or grade
immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction.



   “LOWEST FLOOR.”  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely
for parking of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a structure’s lowest floor, provided that
such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.



   “MANUFACTURED HOME.”  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used
with or without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the
required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers,
and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive
days or longer and intended to be improved property. The term “manufactured
home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.” (See “recreational
vehicle.”)

followed by a letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits
represent the map panel. The letter suffix represents the number of times the
map panel has been revised. The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the
letter “B” is the first revision.



   “MARKET VALUE.”  The property value, excluding the land (as agreed
between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. Market value of the structure can be established by
independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of
structure (actual cash value) or adjusted assessed values.



   “MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL).”  The average height of the sea for all
stages of the tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program,
the MSL is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the
floodplain as shown on a community’s FIRM. For purposes of this chapter,
the term is synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD)
1929 or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988.



   “MITIGATION.”  Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate
long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The
purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to
minimize the costs of disaster response and recovery.



   “MUDSLIDE” or “MUDFLOW.”  Describes a condition where there is
a river, flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a
result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent
accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy
or sustained rain. A mudslide or mudflow may occur as a distinct phenomenon
while a landslide is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the
Floodplain Administrator only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the
proximate cause of damage that occurs.



   “MUDSLIDE OR MUDFLOW AREA MANAGEMENT.”  The operation of and
overall program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide
or mudflow damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations.



   “MUDSLIDE OR MUDFLOW-PRONE AREA.”  An area with land surfaces and
slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate
indicate a potential for mudflow.



   “NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP).”  The federal program
that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating
communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal
government and the private insurance industry.



   “NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD).”  As corrected in 1929,
a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations
within the floodplain. Generally used as the vertical datum on the older
FIRMs. Refer to FIRM legend panel for correct datum.



   “NEW CONSTRUCTION.”  Structures for which the start of
construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain
management regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.



   “NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.”  A manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or
after the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by
a community.

constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;



   (E)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so
as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components
during conditions of flooding; and if within Zones AH or AO, so that there
are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters
around and away from proposed structures;



   (F)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;

structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not furthered, extended, or
replaced.



(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § A, passed 9-5-06)



§ 152.31  SPECIFIC STANDARDS.



   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have
been provided as set forth in § 152.07, the following provisions are
required:



   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment and ductwork
elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings
sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces
on walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of division (C) of
this section.



      (1)   In an AO Zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above
the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number
specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the
highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. (The Commonwealth of
Kentucky recommends that the lowest floor be elevated above the highest
adjacent grade to a height higher than the depth number specified in feet on
the FIRM by at least one foot, or elevated at least three feet above the
highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.)



      (2)   In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will
determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods
include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses,
use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use
of historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no
data can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than one
foot above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR Chapter 4, Regulation
060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements for a
state floodplain permit: The applicant shall provide cross-sections for
determining floodway boundaries, and thereby base flood elevations, at any
proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All
cross-sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical
error tolerances of no more than ± 0.5 foot. Cross-section elevations shall
be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at
points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each
cross-section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in
the number and at the locations specified by the Cabinet. If necessary to
ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the Cabinet may require
additional cross- sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond
those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.



      (3)   In all other zones, elevated two feet above the base
flood elevation.



      (4)   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of
the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building
inspection department to be properly elevated. Such certification and
verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.



   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure,
including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes, shall be
elevated to conform with division (A) of this section or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:



      (1)   Be floodproofed below an elevation two feet above the
level of the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;



      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;



      (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall
certify that the standards of this division are satisfied. Such certification
along with the design and operational maintenance plans shall be provided
Floodplain Administrator.



      (4)   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in division
(D) of this section.



      (5)   All new construction and substantial improvement with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which
are subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood- resistant materials
below an elevation two feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of flood water. Opening sizes for meeting
this requirement must meet or exceed the standards of § 152.31(C).



   (C)   Elevated structures. New construction and substantial
improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that
include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls
below the lowest level shall be designed to preclude finished living space
and designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.



      (1)   Openings for complying with this requirement must either
be certified by a professional engineer or architect and meet the following
minimum criteria:



         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total
net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding;



         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot above foundation interior grade, which must be equal to in elevation
or higher than the exterior foundation grade; and



         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic
flow of flood waters in both directions.



      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard
exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).



      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms.



      (4)   The total floor area of all such enclosed areas shall
not exceed 300 square feet.



      (5)   For enclosures greater that seven feet in interior
height, where elevation requirements exceed six feet above the highest
adjacent grade, a copy of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting
the conversion of the area below the lowest floor to a use or dimension
contrary to the structures’ originally approved design, shall be presented
as a condition of issue of the final certificate of occupancy.



   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.



      (1)   All new and substantially improved manufactured homes
placed on sites located within A, Al-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community’s

Kentucky recommends at least one foot above the base flood elevation); and



         (c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.



      (3)   Excepting manufactured homes that have incurred
substantial damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or
substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
must be elevated so that:



         (a)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an

(FIRM) must either:



            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive
days;



            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use;
or



            3.   Meet the permit requirements for new
construction of this chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements
for manufactured homes.



         (c)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if
it is licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor
vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the
site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.



   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard
established in § 152.07, are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the
following provisions shall apply:



      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless
certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood
discharge;



      (2)   If division (E)(1) above is satisfied, all new
construction and substantial improvements and other proposed new development
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
152.30 through 152.36.



(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § B, passed 9-5-06; Am. Ord. 2006-19, passed 9-19-06;
Am. Ord. 2014-1, passed 2-4-14)



§ 152.32  STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
AND/OR FLOODWAYS.



   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 152.07,
where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where
base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions
apply:



   (A)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall
be located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical
data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.



   (B)   New construction or substantial improvements of structures
shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance
with § 152.07.



(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § C, passed 9-5-06; Am. Ord. 2014-1, passed 2-4-14)



§ 152.33  STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES.



   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 152.07,
are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:



   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above either the base flood elevation, or in Zone AO, the
flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest
adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor,
including basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest
adjacent grade.



   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures shall:



      (1)   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to
or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade.
In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent
grade.



      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities
be completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in
Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so
that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in § 152.31(B).



(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § D, passed 9-5-06)



§ 152.34  STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.



   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area
and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;



   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;



   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards;



   (D)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available, base flood elevation and floodway data for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser,
shall be provided;



   (E)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed
structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base
flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall
be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided
to the Floodplain Administrator; and



(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 5, § E, passed 9-5-06; Am. Ord. 2014-1, passed 2-4-14)



§ 152.35  STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH
THE LETTER “A”.



   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated
“A” the following provisions shall apply:



   (A)   Must be non-habitable;



   (B)   Must be anchored to resist flotation and lateral movement;



   (C)   Must be provided with flood openings in accordance with the
standards of § 152.31(C);



   (D)   Must be built of flood resistant materials below a level two
feet above the base flood elevation;



   (E)   Must elevate utilities one foot above the base flood elevation;



   (F)   Can only be used for storage or parking;



   (G)   Must not be modified for a different use after permitting.

§ 152.36  CRITICAL FACILITIES.



   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain).
Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the
floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the
SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the base
flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken
to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
flood waters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT



§ 152.50  FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR DESIGNATED; DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.



   (A)   The City Council hereby appoints the Mayor, or the Mayor’s
designee, to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this
chapter by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its
provisions, and is herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.



   (B)   The Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed,
authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions
of this chapter. The Floodplain Administrator is further authorized to render
interpretations of this chapter, which are consistent with its spirit and
purpose by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its
provisions.



   (C)   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain
Administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following:



      (1)   Permit review. Review all development permits to ensure
that:



         (a)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been
satisfied;



         (b)   All other required state and federal permits have
been obtained: review proposed development to assure that all necessary
permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which
approval is required by federal or state law, including § 404 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;



         (c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible
manner;



         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect
the carrying capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter,
“adversely affects” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development
will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot at any point.



      (2)   Review and use of any other base flood data. When base
flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with § 152.07, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state
agency, or other source, in order to administer §§ 152.30 through 152.36.
Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for adoption.



      (3)   Notification of other agencies.



         (a)   Notify adjacent communities, the Kentucky Division
of Water, and any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or
regulatory authority prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse;



         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the
Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA);
and



         (c)   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.



      (4)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and
maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:



         (a)   Certification required by § 152.51(B)(1) (lowest
floor elevations) as shown on an accurately completed and certified elevation
certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially
improved structures, in accordance with § 152.51(B)(2);



         (b)   Certification required by § 152.51(B)(2)
(elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) as shown on an
accurately completed and certified floodproofing certificate. Verify and
record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new
or substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in accordance
with § 152.51(B)(2);



         (c)   Certification required by § 152.31(C);



         (d)   Certification of elevation required by §
152.34(A) (subdivision standards);



         (e)   Certification required by § 152.31(E) (floodway
encroachments);



         (f)   Assure that maintenance is provided within the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood- carrying
capacity is not diminished;



         (g)   Review certified plans and specifications for
compliance;



         (h)   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations
of this chapter as specified in §§ 152.98 and 152.99.



      (5)   Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed,
as to the exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas,
for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions.



         (a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, for example,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual
field conditions, the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
152.52(C)(1);



         (b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data
have not been provided in accordance with § 152.07, then the Floodplain
Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source,
in order to administer the provisions of §§ 152.30 through 152.36;



         (c)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular
structure, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a
registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with §
152.31(B) a floodproofing certificate;



         (d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this
chapter shall be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and
shall be open for public inspection.



      (6)   Right of entry.



         (a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to
enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, or whenever the Administrator
has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon
any premises any condition or ordinance violation which makes such building,
structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Floodplain
Administrator may enter such building, structure or premises at all
reasonable times to inspect the same or perform any duty imposed upon the
Administrator by this chapter.



         (b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, the
Floodplain Administrator he or she shall first present proper credentials and
request entry. If such building, structure, or premises are unoccupied, the
Floodplain Administrator shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the
owner or other persons having charge or control of such request entry.



         (c)   If entry is refused, the Floodplain Administrator
shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.



         (d)   When the Floodplain Administrator shall have first
obtained a proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to
secure entry, no owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care
or control of any building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect,
after proper request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry
therein by the Floodplain Administrator for the purpose of inspection and
examination pursuant to this chapter.



      (7)   Stop work orders. Upon notice from the Floodplain
Administrator, work on any building, structure or premises that is being done
contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall immediately cease. Such
notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property,
or to his or her agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall state the
conditions under which work may be resumed.



      (8)   Revocation of permits.



         (a)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit
or approval, issued under the provisions of this chapter, in case there has
been any false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the
application or plans on which the permit or approval was based.



         (b)   The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a permit
upon determination by the Administrator that the construction, erection,
alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the
structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in
conformity with, the provisions of this chapter.



      (9)   Liability. Any officer, employee, or member of the
Floodplain Administrator’s staff, charged with the enforcement of this
chapter, acting for the applicable governing authority in the discharge of
his or her duties, shall not thereby render the Floodplain Administrator
personally liable, and is hereby relieved from all personal liability, for
any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act
required or permitted in the discharge of the Floodplain Administrator’s
duties. Any suit brought against any officer, employee, or member because of
such act performed by him or her in the enforcement of any provision of this
chapter shall be defended by the department of law until the final
termination of the proceedings.



      (10)   Expiration of floodplain construction permit. A
floodplain development permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall
expire if the “start of construction” permit has not occurred within 180
calendar days from the date of its issuance.

§ 152.51  ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.



   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in §
152.07. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials,
drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of the
Administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can
be processed. Specifically, the following information is required.



   (A)   Application stage.



      (1)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL)
of the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A
and elevation of highest adjacent grade; or



      (2)   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to
which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed;



      (3)   All appropriate certifications from a registered
professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed
structure will meet the floodproofing criteria in § 152.31 (B) and §
152.33(B);



      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will
be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.



   (B)   Construction stage.



      (1)   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before
construction continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it
shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator and to the state a certification of the elevation of the lowest
floor or floodproofed elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In
AE, Al-30, AH, and A Zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base
flood elevation, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same.



      (2)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular
structure, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued
work undertaken prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the
permit holder’s risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest
floor and floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately
and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to
submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall
be cause to issue a stop- work order for the project.



(Ord. 2006-14, Art. 4, § B, passed 9-5-06)



§ 152.52  APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Nature of variances.



      (1)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the
chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances
pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may
be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual
that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an
exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The
characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent
parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to
the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.



      (2)   It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its
citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of
the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that
variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood
chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and
contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be
properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in
which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.



   (B)   Designation of variance and appeal board. City Council shall
establish an Appeal Board consisting of the Board of Adjustments.



   (C)   Duties of variance and Appeal Board.



      (1)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.



      (2)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Campbell Circuit Court, as
provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.



   (D)   Appeals/variance procedures. In passing upon such
applications, the Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all
relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter,
and the:



      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;



      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;



      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual
owner and future owners of the property;



      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by
the proposed facility;



      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront,
in the case of functionally dependent facility;



      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not
subject to flooding or erosion damage;



      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;



      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;



      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;



      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and



      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and
bridges and culverts.



   (E)   Conditions for variances.



      (1)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the
purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.



      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.



      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood
hazard. Minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances
to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.



      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:



         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and



         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood height, additional threats to public
safety, cause extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, as defined in
§ 152.05, “public safety and nuisance”, cause fraud or victimization of
the public, as defined in § 152.05, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.



      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood
elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.



      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records
of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) upon request.



      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of
divisions (D)(1) through (D)(5) above are satisfied and that the structure or
other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during
the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and
does not create a public nuisance.



   (F)   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is
granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community
official that:



      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and;



      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Campbell County Clerk and shall
be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the
affected parcel of land.



      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of
all variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial,
and report such variances issued in the community’s biennial report
submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.



   (G)   Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition in § 152.05) upon
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude
the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.

Floodplain Administrator may issue a citation to the offender stating the
violation, prior notices of violation issued, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with
the approved permit, and within what period of time the remedy is to occur,

person to whom the citation is issued shall respond to the citation within
seven days of the date the citation is issued by either carrying out the
remedies and corrections set forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set
forth in the citation or requesting a hearing before the governing body. If

hearing and the determination that a violation occurred shall be considered
final.

SECTION 9.12  CONTINUING EXISTING USES AND STRUCTURES(NONCONFORMING).



   A.   Nonconforming lots of record:



      1.   Any lot of record which does not meet the requirements of
this appendix shall be considered a nonconforming lot of record.



      2.   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions
of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the
time of passage or amendment of this appendix, and if all or part of the lots
do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this
appendix, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel
for the purposes of this appendix, and no portion of that parcel shall be
used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements established
by this appendix, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves
remaining any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this
appendix.



      3.   Where a single nonconforming lot of record exists having
a lot area less than required by the particular zone district wherein the lot
is located, development may be permitted on the lot, provided: the lot is
located on an existing and improved public street; the lot is of separate
ownership from all adjacent and contiguous parcels; the adjacent and
contiguous parcels exist as developed building lots or dedicated street
right-of-ways precluding acquisition of additional area to achieve
conformity; and development proposed on the lot is in conformance with all
other requirements of this appendix. Where a dimensional variance from any
minimum yard, setback, and the like is necessary to develop on the lot, an
application for dimensional variance shall be submitted for review and
approval by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with § 18.0 through 18.9.



   B.   Nonconforming uses:



      1.   Continuance: Except as herein provided, the lawful use of
any structure or land existing at the time of the adoption of this appendix
may be continued although that use does not conform to the provisions of this
appendix; it shall become a legal nonconforming use. However, no
nonconforming use or structure may be enlarged or extended beyond its area of
use at the time it becomes a legal nonconforming use, unless and until the
use is brought into conformance with all provisions of this appendix.



      2.   Change from one nonconforming use to another:



         a.   The lawful use of a building or premises existing
at the time of adoption of this zoning code may be continued, although such
use does not conform to the provisions of such zoning code, except as
otherwise provided therein.



         b.   The Board of Adjustment shall not allow the
enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of
its operation at the time the regulation which makes its use nonconforming
was adopted, nor shall the Board permit as change from one nonconforming use
to another unless the new nonconforming use is in the same or a more
restrictive classification. However, the Board may grant approval, effective
to maintain nonconforming-use status, for enlargements or extensions, made or
to be made, of the facilities of a nonconforming use, where the use consists
of the presenting of a major public attraction or attractions, such as a
sports event or events, which has been presented at the same site over such
period of years and has such attributes and public acceptance as to have
attained international prestige and to have achieved the status of a public
tradition, contributing substantially to the economy of the community and
state, of which prestige and status the site is an essential element, and
where the enlargement or extension was or is designed to maintain the
prestige and status by meeting the increasing demands of participants and
patrons.



      3.   Termination: in all cases, the Board of Adjustments shall
hold a public hearing in accordance with the applicable requirements of §
18.2. Following that hearing, the Board may terminate the right to operate a
nonconforming use based on any of the following conditions, and if the
decision is to do so, the Board shall state its bases, in writing, for that
determination.



         a.   Non-operative, non-used, or abandoned for a period
of 12 consecutive months providing that the Board of Adjustments may allow
the continuation of that nonconforming use if it is determined that reasons
for the nonuse were beyond the owner’s/ operator’s control.



         b.   Whenever the structure, in which the nonconforming
use is operated, is damaged in any manner whatsoever and the cost of
repairing such damage exceeds 50% of the market value of that structure in
which the nonconforming use is operated and a determination is made by the
Board of Adjustment that this structure should not be reconstructed.



         c.   Whenever the structure, in which the nonconforming
use is operated, becomes obsolete or substandard under any applicable
ordinance of the city and the cost of placing that structure in lawful
compliance with the applicable ordinance exceeds 50% of the market value of
that structure as of the date of the official order under the applicable
ordinance and a determination is made by the Board of Adjustment that this
structure should not be reconstructed.



         d.   Whenever said nonconforming use is determined to be
detrimental or injurious to the public health, safety, or general welfare.



      4.   Zone change: the foregoing provisions shall apply to uses
which become legally nonconforming due to zone changes which take place
thereafter.



   C.   Nonconforming structures:



      1.   Continuance: except as herein provided, any lawful
nonconforming structure existing at the time of adoption of this appendix,
may be occupied, operated, and maintained in a state of good repair, but no
nonconforming structure shall be enlarged or extended unless the enlargement
or extension can be, and is, made in compliance with all of the provisions of
this appendix.



      2.   Termination: In all cases the Board of Adjustment shall
hold a public hearing in accordance with the applicable requirements of §
18.2. Following that hearing, the Board may terminate the right to operate a
nonconforming structure based on any of the following conditions, and if the
decision is to do so, the Board shall state its bases, in writing, for that
determination.



         a.   Whenever the nonconforming structure is damaged in
any manner exceeds 50% of the market value of that structure and a
determination is made by the Board of Adjustment that the structure should
not be reconstructed.



         b.   Whenever the nonconforming structure becomes
obsolete or substandard under any applicable ordinance of the city and the
cost of placing the nonconforming structure in lawful compliance with the
applicable ordinance exceeds 50% of the market value of the nonconforming
structure as of the date of the official order under the applicable ordinance
and a determination is made by the Board of Adjustment that the structure
should not be reconstructed.



         c.   Whenever a nonconforming structure is determined to
be detrimental or injurious to the public health, safety, or general welfare.



      3.   Zone change: The foregoing provisions shall apply to
structures which become legally nonconforming due to zone changes which take
place thereafter.



   D.   Repairs and maintenance:



      1.   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement or nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that
the cubic content of the building, as it existed at the time of passage or
amendment of this appendix which rendered it nonconforming, shall not be
increased.



      2.   Nothing in this appendix shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring, to a safe condition, of any building, structure,
or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting
the public safety, except for the conditions as stated in B, 3, b, or C, 2, b
of this section.



   E.   Nonconforming signs:



      1.   Continuance: Except as herein provided, any lawful
nonconforming sign existing at the time of adoption of this appendix, may be
continued; however, no sign shall be changed in any manner unless it is
changed in compliance with all provisions of this appendix.



      2.   Termination: In all cases, the Board of Adjustment shall
hold a public hearing in accordance with the applicable requirements of §
18.2. Following that hearing, the Board may terminate the right to operate a
nonconforming sign based on any of the following conditions and, if the
decision is to do so, the Board shall state its bases, in writing, for
determination and the property owner shall be responsible to remove the sign
at the owner’s expense. If the sign is not removed within 30 days of the
date of the Board’s action to terminate the sign, the city may remove the
sign and may bill the owner, or attach the cost of the service to the annual
property tax bill:



         a.   Not meeting the requirements for sign regulations,
as regulated in § 14.0 through 14.7.



         b.   Nonuse or abandonment of a nonconforming sign for a
period of 12 consecutive months.

SECTION 9.13  EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS:



   A.   Exceptions to height limits: the height limitations of this
appendix shall not apply to such things as: church spires, various types of
towers, smoke stacks, other related structures and necessary mechanical
appurtenances, etc.; provided their construction is in accordance with
existing or hereafter adopted ordinances of the city and is acceptable to the
Federal Aviation Agency and the Federal Communications Commission.



   B.   Front yard variance: where the average depth of existing front
yards within 300 feet of the lot in question and within the same block front,
is greater than the minimum front yard depth required by this appendix, the
required minimum front yard depth on the lot shall be modified to be the
average depth of the existing front yards.



   C.   Exception to area and yard regulations:  where existing or
proposed development within the R-3 Zone is to be subdivided, the minimum
area and yard requirements may be less than required by this appendix
provided that:



      1.   The maximum density of the zone is not exceeded or the
minimum site for the total development must not be less than that required by
the respective zone.



      2.   A site plan, as required by the applicable requirements
of § 9.19, including the proposed area and yard requirements for the
development, is submitted for review and approval by the Planning Commission.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 9.14  CONDITIONAL USES.



   A.   Determination: subject to the requirements of § 18.7, the
Board of Adjustments may authorize a conditional use to be located within any
zone in which such conditional use is permitted, if the evidence presented by
the applicant is such as to establish, beyond any reasonable doubt:



      1.   That the proposed use at the particular location is
necessary or desirable to provide a service or facility which will contribute
to the general well-being of the neighborhood or the community;



      2.   That such use will not be detrimental to the health,
safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or
injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity.



   B.   Conditional use permits: in accordance with KRS 100.237, the
Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide applications for
conditional use permits to allow the proper integration into the community of
uses which are specifically named herein which may be suitable only in
specific locations in the zone only if certain conditions are met:



      1.   The Board of Adjustments may approve, modify, or deny any
application for a conditional use permit. If it approves a permit, it may
attach necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one
or more things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of
a continuing nature. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board’s
minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a reference to the
specific section in the zoning regulation listing the conditional use under
consideration. In addition, said conditional use permit shall be recorded in
the office of the County clerk and one copy of said permit attached to the
deed for the property for which it is issued. The Board shall have power to
revoke conditional use permits, or variance for noncompliance with the
condition thereof. Furthermore, the Board shall have a right of action to
compel offending structures or uses removed at the cost of the violator and
may have judgment in persona for that cost.



      2.   Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the
applicant from complying with all of the requirements of this appendix, the
building code, housing code, and other regulations of the city.



      3.   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been
exercised within the time limit set by the Board or within 12 consecutive
calendar months from date of issuance, such conditional use permit shall not
revert to its original designation unless there has been a public hearing.
Exercised as set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for
the construction of the main building or other improvement has been let; or
in the absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is
under construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions
involving substantial investment shall be under contract, in development, or
completed. When construction is not a part of the use, exercised shall mean
that the use is in operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth
in the permit.



      4.   a.   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall
review all conditional use permits, except those for which all conditions
have been permanently satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the
power to inspect the land or structure where the conditional use is located
in order to ascertain that the landowner is complying with all of the
conditions which are listed on the conditional use permits.



         b.   If the landowner is not complying with all of the
conditions listed on the conditional use permit, the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator shall report the fact in writing to the Chairman of the Board
of Adjustment. The report shall state specifically the manner in which the
landowner is not complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit,
and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time
it is furnished to the chairman of the Board of Adjustment.



         c.   The Board shall hold a hearing on the report within
a reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be
furnished to the landowner at least one week prior to the hearing. If the
Board of Adjustment finds that the facts alleged in the report of the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator are true and that the landowner has taken no
steps to comply within the time between the date of the report and the date
of the hearing, the Board of Adjustment may authorize the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator to revoke the conditional use permit and take
the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity on the
land which the conditional use permit authorizes.



      5.   Once the Board of Adjustment has completed a conditional
use permit and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be
completely and permanently satisfied, the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator, upon request of the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make
a determination that the conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts
which indicate that the conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in
the margin of the copy of the conditional use permit which is on file with
the County clerk, as required in KRS 100.329. Thereafter the use, if it
continues to meet the other requirements of this appendix, will be treated as
a permitted use.

      2.   A plot plan, footing and foundation plan, and
construction plans for any new construction;



      3.   A statement from the applicable legislative body insuring
that all past and current taxes have been paid.



      4.   Upon receipt of the foregoing items, the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall inspect the building, structure, or
improvements, and the proposed location where same will be set within the
city and determine if the proposed development will comply with all
applicable codes and regulations.



      5.   The move and set shall be referred to the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator for approval or denial of compliance with this
appendix.



      6.   Upon approval by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator,
a building permit to move and set shall be issued. The City Engineer shall
then be notified of same and shall issue a transportation permit. The City
Engineer or his agent shall designate the route to be traveled. The transport
permit is good only for the date specified on permit. The transport permit
will not be issued if 90 consecutive calendar days or more have lapsed from
the date of inspection by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator. The
transport permit provided for in this section shall not be in lieu of any
other permits which may be required by the city.



      7.   No transport or building permit to move and set shall be
issued until the applicant has first obtained the necessary permits from the
telephone company, public utilities companies, railroad companies, and the
Kentucky Department of Transportation, and the county road supervisor,
whichever are applicable.



   D.   Fees:



      1.   There will be a building investigation fee as established
by the City Council to cover the costs of investigation and inspection for
determining the structural soundness of buildings, structures, or
improvements to be moved, the fee is payable in advance and must accompany
the application provided for herein. The inspection shall determine what will
be necessary to bring buildings, structures, or improvements into compliance
with all applicable codes and regulations should the building not comply.
This fee is not returnable. If buildings, structures, or improvements are
found to be in compliance with the city’s applicable codes and regulations,
a building permit to move and set will be issued and the fee will be based on
the cost of new foundations and all work necessary to place the building or
structure in its completed condition in the new location. This fee is in
addition to the building investigation fee.



      2.   No person, corporation, or company shall transport, move,
or set any building, structure, or improvement in the jurisdiction of the
City Council, until and unless such person, corporation, or company shall
post with the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator a good and sufficient
indemnity bond in the amount of $5,000 in favor of the city. The bond shall
be made by a surety corporation authorized to do business in the state.

SECTION 9.17  SCREENING AND DUMPSTER AREA.



   Screening areas shall be provided for the purpose of minimizing the
friction between incompatible land uses and improving the aesthetic and
functional quality of new development.



   A.   Screening area requirements: all screening areas shall be
approved by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator (or Planning Commission,
where required by this appendix) according to a submitted site plan as
regulated by the applicable requirements of this appendix. Screening areas
shall be designed, provided, and maintained according to the following:



      1.   Where vegetative and/or topographic conditions that
provide a natural screening and buffer exist prior to development of
properties in question, every effort shall be made to retain such conditions.
In such cases additional screening may not be required, provided that
provision is made for maintenance of such condition to the satisfaction of
the City Council.



      2.   Wherever screening is required in this appendix, all

necessary, and the type of screening needed. The City Council may require
review of the proposed screening plan from the U.S. Soil Conservation
Service, or the applicable County Agricultural Extension Service.



      6.   Screening areas are to be provided within the required
minimum yard setback as required in each district’s regulation. In the case
where property is located adjacent to another governmental jurisdiction,
screening requirement shall be the same as if the zone in the adjacent
legislative body (or a zone containing the most similar types of permitted
uses as provided herein) were located within this city.



      7.   In the case where a zoning map change occurs resulting in
adjacency to a different zoning district that was previously the case, and
where development has already occurred on property in the unchanged district,
required additional setbacks and screening requirements (as required in each
district’s regulations) shall be provided for the property in the district
where the zone change occurred.



   B.   Provision and maintenance: required screening areas shall be
provided as a condition of development by the owner or developer. All
required screening (including the planting of trees and other vegetation)
shall be maintained by the property owner.

regulated according to the following requirements:



      1.   Except as herein provided, no swimming pool or associated
equipment shall be permitted within any minimum front, side, or rear yard
depth, nor within any public utility right-of-way easement. Above ground
pools, including apparatus and equipment pertaining to the operation of the
swimming pool, shall be permitted within any minimum side or rear yard depth
of the lot or easement; provided, however, that if at any time construction,
repair, or maintenance is necessary within the easement, removal of the pool
will be at the owner’s expense.



      2.   Swimming pools which are constructed in-ground, shall be
required to have a fence or wall, including a self-closing or self-locking
door or gate around the pool or the property on which the pool is located.
Such fence or wall shall be at least four feet, but not more than seven feet
in height (only classes 1, 3, 4, or 5 fences are permitted, as regulated in
§ 13.10). The fence or wall shall be constructed in such a manner so that a
small child may not reach the pool from the street or any adjacent property
without climbing the fence or wall or opening the gate or door.



      3.   a.   Swimming pools, which are located above ground,
shall be required to have a fence or wall, including a self-closing or
self-locking door or gate around the pool or property upon which the pool is
located. Such fence or wall shall be at least four (4) feet, but not more
than seven (7) feet in height (only classes 1, 3, 4, and 5 are permitted as
regulated by Article XIII of this appendix). Such fence or wall shall be
constructed in such a manner that a small child may not reach the pool from
the street or any adjacent property without scaling a fence or wall or
opening the gate or door. Said wall may be the wall of the above ground pool
providing that said wall is at least four (4) feet in height above the
surrounding ground level.



         b.   Any access to above ground pools by means of a
ladder or stairway shall be provided with a self-closing or self-locking door
or gate, or some other device that would prevent a small child from gaining
access to the pool by means of a ladder.



      4.   Glare from lights used to illuminate the swimming pool
area shall be directed away from adjacent properties.



      5.   All swimming pools and associated equipment shall be

and regulations of the city. Water used in the swimming pool, which is
obtained from other than a public source, shall be approved by the Northern
Kentucky District Health Department.



      6.   All swimming pools existing at the time of adoption of
this appendix which are unprotected by a surrounding fence or wall, including
gates or doors, as regulated herein, shall be required to comply with the
provisions of this appendix section within 60 days after its adoption.



   B.   Public, semi-public and commercial swimming pools: all public,
semipublic, and commercial swimming pools shall be regulated according to the
following requirements:

SECTION 9.24  HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS.



   A.   This section is designed to ensure, when development is
proposed in those areas of the community which have physical characteristics
limiting development (hillside slopes of 20% or greater) that said
development will occur in a manner harmonious with adjacent lands so as to
minimize problems of drainage, erosion, earth movement, and other natural
hazards.



   B.   Areas of land on which development is physically restricted due
to excessive hillside slopes shall be limited according to the following
requirements:



      1.   Development proposed on land areas identified on the
Comprehensive Plan as physically restrictive development areas and any other
areas, which have slopes of 20% or greater shall require approval before
development may occur. In those areas which are identified in the
Comprehensive Plan as physically restrictive development areas and containing
slopes less than 20%, the requirements contained herein may be waived; if,
after review of the proposed site plan by the engineer it is determined that
the development will not result in hillside slippage or soil erosion.



      2.   No excavation, removal, or placement of any soil,
foundation placement, or construction of buildings or structures of any
nature within the area identified in B.1. above, may occur until plan
specifications for such work have been submitted in the form of a site plan
as regulated by § 9.19. In addition to site plan requirements, the following
shall also be submitted:



         a.   Plans which show existing topography and the
proposed physical changes necessary for construction, indicating grading
(cutting and filling) compaction, erosion ponds, areas to be defoliated, and
any other pertinent information which will change the natural physical
features of the site or general area.



         b.   Information defining results of subsurface
investigation of the area under consideration, including test borings,
laboratory tests, engineering tests, and a geological analysis. The
investigation shall be made by a qualified registered civil engineer and a
geologist, indicating that any structural or physical changes proposed in the
area will be completed in manner which will minimize hillside slippage or
soil erosion.



      3.   The site plan and other information required in § 9.19
shall be reviewed by the engineer and the Northern Kentucky Area Planning
Commission staff, who will recommend to the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative, what effect the proposed development will have on
hillside slippage and soil erosion After consideration of the recommendation,
the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, may authorize
use of the site in accordance with the submitted plans.



      4.   If, after review of the plans required by this section,
the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, determines
that the proposed plans will not minimize hillside slippage, the Planning
Commission shall deny a permit for the development of the land.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 9.25  GENERAL MOBILE HOME REGULATIONS.

Health Department and the Sanitation District No. 1 of Campbell and Kenton
Counties), and safety requirements applicable to a conventional dwelling,
shall be equally applicable to a mobile home.



   C.   The mobile home shall be set and adequately anchored on a
concrete or hard surfaced slab in accordance with the Kentucky Mobile Home
and Recreational Vehicle Park regulations and the open space between the
ground and the floor f the mobile home shall be enclosed with some material
as concrete block, corrugated metal, or other durable and suitable material.



   D.   Any person, firm, or corporation desiring to locate a mobile
home shall apply for a zoning/building permit, and an occupancy permit.
Applicable permits must be approved prior to the installation and occupancy
of any mobile home. The proper permits must be displayed in a conspicuous
location in each mobile home, signifying that all permits have been approved
by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator.



   E.   All mobile homes shall meet the requirements of KRS 219.310 
through 219.410.



SECTION 9.26  PHASED ZONING REGULATIONS.



   A.   Phased zoning is an overlay type regulation to be used in cases
where the timing and/or phasing of the zoning of an area is especially
critical to the implementation of the adopted Comprehensive Plan. The intent
of the phased zoning regulations is to encourage redevelopment of a specified
area for the use or density designated on the Comprehensive Plan when the
necessary conditions for such development are realized (e.g., demolition of
existing deteriorated areas; provision of urban services, such as public
water and centralized sanitary sewer systems). Implicit in such a phased
zoning approach is the premise that until such conditions are realized, the
type of development identified by the comprehensive plan is premature; such
development would be prevented by temporarily zoning the area to generally
conform with the predominant existing land use, with a clear stipulation of
an intended future re-zoning, which would be in compliance with the adopted
Comprehensive Plan.



   B.   The phased zoning regulations may be overlaid over any zoning
classification by means of a conventional zone change process. The use of the
phased zoning regulations would indicate that the regulations of the overlaid
zone are currently being enforced based upon the general existing land use,
but on attainment of all the requirements of the zone which corresponds to
the adopted Comprehensive Plan for type of use or density, the area could be
rezoned in direct compliance with the plan.



   C.   Phased zones are indicated on the official zoning map by adding
to the overlaid zone, the letter “P” as a suffix enclosed in parentheses.
For example, in order to properly phase its change, an area zoned R-1JJ,
which is identified for future use on the adopted Comprehensive Plan for
industrial could be temporarily zoned R-1JJ (P), indicated that present
development on the site would be in conformance with the regulations of the
overlaid R-1JJ Zone, but that, upon the attainment of certain conditions (for
example, provision of flood levee and demolition of existing buildings) as
indicated on the local Comprehensive Plan, the area could be rezoned through
a conventional zone change procedure. At the time of the zone change, the
temporary R-1JJ (P) zone is removed and the area is developed according to
the regulations of the new zone, which is in conformance with the adopted
Comprehensive Plan.



   D.   The minimum size of any area to be rezoned as regulated by this
section of the ordinance is five acres, provided that all other provisions of
this appendix and the subdivision regulations are adhered to. Development of
a smaller tract adjacent to an existing zone being requested may be permitted
if the proposed development conforms to and extends the original development
as if the new area had been a part of the original development and provided
further that the zone is in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.

receiving the recommendations of the Planning Commission, review said
recommendation and take action to approve or disapprove said RCD application.
Such action may incorporate any conditions imposed by the City Council.
However, should the City Council take action to impose different conditions
than were reviewed and considered by the Planning



Commission then said conditions shall be resubmitted to the Planning
Commission for further review and recommendations in accordance with division
C.1.a. above. Approval of the RCD Overlay Zone shall require that development
be in conformance with the Stage I approved plan.



         c.   The City Council shall forward a copy of the
approved plan to the Planning Commission for further processing in accordance
with the requirement for Stage II Plan and record plat.



         d.   Zoning map amendment - upon approval of the RCD
Overlay Zone, the official zoning map shall be amended by adding the prefix
“RCD” to the existing residential (R-1) Zone (such as RCD-R-1B, RCD-R-1C,
and so on) for the area as shown on the Stage I approved plan.



      2.   Stage II Development Plan and Record Plat: a Stage II Plan



and record plat shall be developed in conformance with the Stage I approved
plan and in accordance with the requirements of § 9.20.B. and C., and
submitted to the Planning Commission for its review and approval. Except for
the manner of submission and processing, the subdivision regulations may be
waived, where applicable, and the requirements of § 9.20.B. and C. shall be
substituted therefore. Those requirements not specifically waived by the
Planning Commission shall conform with the subdivision regulations.



         a.   1)   The Planning Commission shall review the
submitted Stage II Plan with regard to its compliance with the required
elements of § 9.20.B., for Stage II development plans, other applicable
elements of this appendix, other applicable regulations, and its conformity
with the Stage I approved plan. The Planning Commission, in approving the
Stage II Plan, may authorize minor adjustments from the Stage I approved
plan, provided that the adjustments do not: change land uses, increase
overall density, significantly alter circulation patterns (vehicular and
pedestrian) or decrease the amount or usability of open space or recreation
areas or affect other applicable requirements of this appendix.



            2)   Upon Planning Commission approval of the
Stage II Plan, a copy of the Plan, shall be forwarded to the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator, who shall grant permits only in accordance
with the Stage II approved plan and other plans as may be required by this
appendix.

applicable requirements of the subdivision regulations, and its conformance
with the Stage II approved plan.



            2)   Upon Planning Commission approval of the
record plat, copies of the plat, certified by the Planning Commission, and
suitable for recording, shall be forwarded by the Planning Commission to the
office of the County Clerk to be recorded.



   D.   Residential uses and densities: attached and detached
single-family dwellings may be permitted, including customary accessory uses
to the permitted residential uses, within a RCD Overlay zone. The density of
dwelling units in a RCD, shall be determined by the density (dwelling units
per net acre) as calculated from the existing residential R-1 zone
superimposed by the RCD Overlay Zone. This density shall be applied to the
total project area excluding that land devoted to streets (public and
private).



   E.   Area requirements: except as herein provided, no RCD Overlay
Zone shall be permitted on less than five acres of land. Development of a
smaller tract adjacent to an existing RCD Overlay Zone may be permitted, if
the proposed development conforms to and extends the original development as
if the new area had been a part of the original development. In addition, the
RCD Overlay Zone may be permitted on less than five acres, if approved by the
Planning Commission, according to the following criteria:



      1.   The proposed development tract would be well integrated
with adjacent development so that it would not adversely affect adjacent
development;



      2.   The limited size of the proposed development tract would
not result in the creation of properties which would be unusable or which
would be isolated by this development.



      3.   The proposed development would connect to or extend
existing circulation systems (vehicular and pedestrian) and not create a
traffic hazard;



      4.   The proposed development, including accessory uses would
be designed so that any noise-creating activities or visually unattractive
areas (such as dumpsters) would be buffered from adjacent properties; and



      5.   The proposed development tract would be a logical parcel
of land for development and not be a series of fragmented parcels intermixed
with existing development.



   F.   Height, yard and setback regulations: requirements shall be as



approved in the plan.



   G.   Off-street parking and loading or unloading: off-street parking
and, when applicable, loading and/or unloading shall be provided in
accordance with §§ 11.0 through 12.2.



   H.   Fences, walls, and signs: the location, height and type of all
fences, walls, and signs shall be as approved in the plan.



   I.   Erosion and sedimentation control: effective erosion and
sediment controls shall be planned and applied in accordance with § 9.8.



   J.   Common open space - recreation area: at least 20% of the total
acreage of the proposed RCD shall be retained as common open space and
recreation area, and dedicated to a public or private entity for operation
and maintenance. The open space and recreation areas shall be physically
situated so as to be readily accessible, available to, and usable by all
residents of the RCD. Common open space and recreation area shall be that
part of the total project exclusive of dwellings, streets, parking areas,
single-family lots, commercial areas, and other non-open space and
non-recreationally oriented facilities.



   K.   Amendments: any amendments to plans, except for the minor
adjustments which may be permitted by the Planning Commission, shall be made
in accordance with the procedure required by this appendix, subject to the
same limitations and requirements as those under which such plans were
originally approved.



   L.   Expiration: any amendment to RCD Overlay Zone shall be subject
to the time constraints, as noted below. Upon expiration of the time period
and any extensions thereto, the City Council may initiate a request for a
public hearing by the Planning Commission, in accordance with the
requirements of KRS Chapter 100, for the purpose of determining whether said
RCD Overlay Zone should revert to its original zoning designation. A public
hearing may be initiated if either of the following conditions apply:



      1.   A Stage II Plan has not been approved by the Planning
Commission within a period of 24 consecutive months from the date of the
Stage I approved plan and RCD Overlay Zone amendment by the City Council;
provided that an extension may be permitted upon approval of the legislative
body or their duly authorized representative if sufficient proof can be
demonstrated that prevailing conditions have not changed appreciably to
render the Stage I approved plan obsolete.



      2.   Substantial construction has not been initiated within a
period of 12 consecutive months from the date of approval of the Stage II
Plan by the Planning Commission; provided than an extension may be permitted
upon approval of the City Council or its duly authorized representative if
sufficient proof can be demonstrated that the construction was delayed due to
circumstances beyond the applicant’s control, and that prevailing
conditions have not changed appreciably to render the Stage I approved plan
obsolete. The amount of construction constituting initiating substantial
construction shall be as approved in the Stage I approved plan.

SECTION 10.15  CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD) ZONE.



   A.   Purpose: the purposes of the Central Business District (CBD)
Zone are to:



      1.   Provide for planned business district of special interest
to the proper development of the city;



      2.   Promote the revitalization of the existing business
district of the city;



      3.   Promote flexibility in the design and development of the
business district, in a planned and coordinated fashion; and



      4.   Provide for the neighborhood commercial-type needs of the
city and the surrounding area.



   B.   Criteria for evaluation of development in the CBD: in order to
encourage and guide the development of the city’s business district in a
way that will result in a coordinated approach to the entire area and ensure
its proper integration into the surrounding community, the following criteria
shall be used as the basis to evaluate any new development, including
expansions or changes to existing development, in the area zoned CBD (refer
to Figure 1 of this section, which illustrates some of these criteria):



      1.   High intensity retail/service (for example, high activity
or traffic generators) uses shall be encouraged to locate adjacent to Sixth
Avenue;



      2.   Pedestrian access shall be encouraged/promoted along
Sixth Avenue via the provision of continuous sidewalks, crosswalks, and
pedestrian resting areas or shelter areas;



      3.   Vehicular access shall be encouraged along the periphery
of the CBD Zone boundaries (such as 5th, 7th, McKinney and Berry Streets, and
the alleys);



      4.   Curb cuts directly onto Sixth Avenue will be severely
restricted in order to promote the pedestrian (mall-type) orientation of
Sixth Avenue (State Route 8) as the major arterial street through the city.
Access is to be encouraged from existing streets intersecting with Sixth
Avenue, the alleys, or fifth or Seventh Avenues;



      5.   The existing alleys should be utilized for the provision
of off-street parking or loading areas via the resurfacing and widening of
the alleys;



      6.   Pedestrian links should be provided from parking along
the alleys or from off-street parking facilities to the primary activity
areas;



      7.   Those areas within the CBD Zone which are adjacent to
existing residential development, specifically the areas abutting 5th and 7th
Streets are transitional areas between the high intensity commercial
development along Sixth Avenue and the residential development. Every effort
should be made to utilize these areas for off-street parking facilities to
provide a transition (or buffer area) as well as encourage access on the
periphery of the business district. Any other type of development in these
areas should be designed in a manner as to be beneficial to the business area
and not be detrimental to those areas which are zoned for residential uses;



      8.   The fagade treatment of buildings including the
utilization of sings, in the CBD Zone should be relatively uniform in design
and type of materials in order to improve the overall attractiveness of the
business district;



      9.   The orientation of commercial buildings should be towards
the alley as well as towards Sixth Avenue (front, rear, or side entrance) in
order to promote the best utilization of the alleys and the safety or ease of
access for customers;



      10.   Areas adjacent to existing residences should be
landscaped to protect the existing residential development. Lighting should
be provided for the safety of customers, but should not glare onto adjacent
residences. Wherever possible, areas within the CBD Zone should also be
landscaped to improve the attractiveness of the business district;



      11.   Private off-street parking facilities shall be located
within a reasonable walking distance of the use they are intended to serve.



   C.   Permitted uses: these are the uses which are permitted on

SECTION 10.17  NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (NCD) ZONE.



   A.   Purpose: the purpose of the Neighborhood Commercial District
(NCD) Zone is to:



      1.   Provide for planned business district of special interest
to the proper development of the city;



      2.   Promote the revitalization of the existing business
district of the city;



      3.   Promote flexibility in the design and development of the
business district, in a planned and coordinated fashion; and



      4.   Provide for the neighborhood commercial-type needs of the
city and the surrounding area.



   B.   Criteria for evaluation of development in the NCD: in order to
encourage and guide the development of the city’s business district in a
way that will result in a coordinated approach to the entire area and ensure
its proper integration into the surrounding community, the following criteria
shall be used as the basis to evaluate any new development, including
expansions or changes to existing development, in the area zoned NCD (refer
to Figure 1 of § 10.15, which illustrates some of these criteria):



      1.   High intensity retail/service (for example, high activity
or traffic generators) uses shall be encouraged to locate adjacent to Sixth
Avenue;



      2.   Pedestrian access shall be encouraged/promoted along
Sixth Avenue via the provision of continuous sidewalks, crosswalks, and
pedestrian resting areas or shelter areas;



      3.   Those areas within the NCD Zone which are adjacent to
existing residential development, specifically the areas abutting 5th and 7th
Streets are transitional areas between the high intensity commercial
development along Sixth Avenue and the residential development. Every effort
should be made to utilize these areas for off-street parking facilities to
provide a transition (or buffer area) as well as encourage access on the
periphery of the business district. Any other type of development in these
areas should be designed in a manner as to be beneficial to the business area
and not be detrimental to those areas which are zoned for residential use;



      4.   The facade treatment of buildings including the
utilization of sings in the NCD Zone should be relatively uniform in design
and type of materials in order to improve the overall attractiveness of the
business district;



      5.   The orientation of commercial buildings should be towards
5th Avenue as well as towards Sixth Avenue (front, rea, or side entrance) in
order to promote the best utilization of 5th Avenue and the safety or ease of
access for customers.



      6.   Areas adjacent to existing residences should be
landscaped to protect existing residential development. Lighting should be
provided for the safety of customers, but should not glare onto adjacent
residences. Whenever possible, areas within the NCD Zone should also be
landscaped to improve the attractiveness of the commercial district.



      7.   Private off-street parking facilities shall be located
within a reasonable walking distance of the use they are intended to serve.



   C.   Permitted uses: these are the uses which are permitted on
property zoned NCD as outlined on the official zoning map providing that they

   A.   Purpose: the purpose of the Mixed Land Use (MLU) Zone is to
provide for the combining of offices, hotels and motels, retail and service
uses, and residential uses within a planned development. Such development is
intended to be designed to provide for an internally oriented group of
activities which are functionally integrated relative to land uses, vehicular
and pedestrian circulation, and the arrangement of structures. In addition,
the intent of the zone is to promote flexibility in design and planned
diversification in the relationships between location of and types of uses
and structures; promote the advantages of modern large scale site planning
for community development through the efficient use of land, facilitating a
more economic arrangement of buildings, circulation systems. land uses, and
utilities; preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the existing landscape
features and amenities, and to utilize such features in a harmonious fashion;
provide for more usable and suitably located open space facilities and common
facilities than would otherwise be provided under conventional land
development procedures, but always with the intention of furthering the
public health, safety, and general welfare.



   B.   General: a MLU Zone may be permitted provided that all
conditions or provisions of this section, the applicable requirements of the
subdivision regulations, and any additional requirements as may be determined
necessary to provide for the most efficient layout of the MLU Zone and its
proper integration with the surrounding development are met; and a public
hearing is held on the MLU application.

Zone shall be processed as follows in two stages:



      1.   Stage I: applications for a map amendment to zone an area
for MLU shall be accompanied by a development plan, in accordance with the
Stage I Plan requirements, provided for within § 9.20. If an area, however,
is currently zoned MLU, the submission of the Stage I development plan for
review by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the legislative body, shall
not be required until the area is proposed to be developed.



         a.   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing
on the proposed application (development plan Stage I and where applicable,
the zoning map amendment), in accordance with the requirements of KRS Chapter
424, and review said application with regard to its compliance with the
stated purposes of the MLU Zone, the required elements of the Stage I Plan
and other applicable requirements of this section. Upon holding such hearing,
the Planning Commission shall make one of the following recommendations to
the legislative body approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval. The
Planning Commission shall submit, along with their recommendations, a copy of
the Stage I Plan and the bases for their recommendation.



         b.   The legislative body shall, within 45 days after
receiving the recommendations of the Planning Commission, review said
recommendations and take action to approve, or disapprove said MLU
application. Such action may incorporate any conditions imposed by the
Planning and Zoning Commission. However, should the legislative body take
action to impose different conditions than were reviewed and considered the
Planning Commission, then said conditions shall be resubmitted to the
Planning Commission for further review and recommendation, in accordance with
division C.1.a. Approval of the MLU Zone shall require that development be in
conformance with the Stage I approved plan. The legislative body shall
forward a copy of the approved plan to the Planning Commission for further
processing, in accordance with the requirement for Stage II plan and record
plat.

other applicable regulations, and its conformity with the Stage I approved
plan. The Planning Commission, in approving the Stage II plan, may authorize
minor adjustments from the Stage I approved plan provided that the
adjustments do not change land uses, increase overall density, significantly
alter circulation patterns (vehicular and pedestrian) or decrease the amount
and/or usability of open space or recreation areas, or conflict with other
applicable requirements of this section, for example, parking requirements.



         b.   Upon Planning Commission approval of the Stage II
plan, a copy of said plan shall be forwarded to the city’s Zoning
Administrator, who shall grant permits only in accordance with the Stage II
approved plan and other regulations, as may be required.

of the proposed MLU development shall be retained as open space or recreation
areas. Such open space/recreation areas shall be physically situated so as to
be readily accessible, available to, and usable by all activities within the
MLU development. Open space and recreation areas shall be that part of the
total project exclusive of parking areas, access drives and streets. At such
time as the Stage II development plan for a particular development is
submitted to the Planning Commission, notwithstanding § 10.18.C.2.a., open
space requirements of less than 20% may be considered for development if:
unusual topographic conditions exist, unique treatment of parking areas is
provided for, and unique conditions and circumstances exist on or adjacent to
the site.



   N.   Criteria: evaluation of the proposed development plan shall be
based upon the following criteria:



      1.   Agreement with the various elements of the Comprehensive
Plan and, where applicable, any KRS Chapter 99 approved urban renewal
development plan.



      2.   Extent to which the proposed development plan is
consistent with the purpose of the MLU Zone.



      3.   Adequacy of the proposed site, considering such factors
as the sufficiency of the size of the site to comply with the established
criteria, the configuration of the site, and the extent to which the site is
formed by logical boundaries (based on topography, natural features, streets,
relationship of adjacent uses, and so on).



      4.   Nature and extend of the proposed uses in relation to the
unique characteristics of the site; the current or anticipated need for such
use(s) and the specific size and locale of the market area from which the
specific uses of the site will draw or serve.



      5.   Extend to which the proposed design, as indicated in the
Stage I plan, is compatible and coordinated with the existing and/or proposed
development contiguous to the site. Compatibility and coordination with
existing and/or proposed development shall be reviewed in terms of intensity
of land use type in relation into the general character of the surrounding
areas, including coordination of vehicular and pedestrian circulation, the
scale (i.e., height and mass of structures), of the proposed development;
location of open spaces and size of setbacks; provisions of screening areas
or utilization of natural features; the transition of land use types based on
the proposed design; and the impact of the proposed development on adjacent
uses, such as noise, visual impact, hours of operation, traffic circulation,
and so on.



      6.   Amount of traffic that would be generated by the proposed
operation and the ability of the existing highway system to adequately handle
said traffic. Where deficiencies exist, proposed traffic improvements that
would correct such deficiencies should be considered.



      7.   Extent to which the design of the internal street system
provides for the efficient and safe movement of traffic within and adjacent
to the site.



      8.   Extend to which all necessary public utilities and
facilities are available to service the development, including police and
fire protection, water and sewer services, and other services normally
provided within the area. Where deficiencies exist, improvements that would
correct such deficiencies should be considered.



   O.   Amendments: any amendments to plans, except for the minor
adjustments which may be permitted by the Planning Commission, shall be made
in accordance with the procedure required by division C.



   P.   Expiration: development plans within the MLU Zone shall be
subject to the time constraints, as noted below. Upon expiration of said time
period and any extensions thereto, the legislative body may initiate a
request for a public hearing by the Planning Commission, in accordance with
the requirements of KRS Chapter 100, for the purpose of determining the
appropriateness of the approved development plan. A public hearing may be
initiated if either of the following conditions apply:



      1.   Stage II Plan has not been approved by the Planning
Commission within a period of 24 consecutive months from the date of the
Stage I approved plan, except as agreed upon for the phasing of development
by the legislative body; provided that an extension may be permitted upon
approval of the legislative body or their duly authorized representative, if
sufficient proof can be demonstrated that prevailing conditions have not
changed appreciably to render the Stage I approved plan obsolete.



      2.   Substantial construction has not been initiated within a
period of 24 consecutive months from the date of approval of the Stage II
plan by the Planning Commission; provided that an extension may be permitted
upon approval of the legislative body or its duly authorized representative.
If sufficient proof can be demonstrated that the construction was delayed due
to circumstances beyond the applicant’s control, and that prevailing
conditions have not changed appreciably to render the Stage I approved plan
obsolete. The amount of construction constituting initiating substantial
construction shall be as approved in the Stage II approved plan.

shall prevail.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 11.1  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



   A.   Computation of parking spaces: in determining the number of
parking spaces required, if such spaces result in fractional parts thereof,
the number of said spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest
whole number.



   B.   Additional parking spaces to be provided: whenever the
intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises shall be increase
through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or
other units of measurement specified herein, additional parking spaces shall
be provided in the amounts hereafter specified for that use, if the existing
parking space is inadequate to serve that increase in intensity of use.



   C.   Location of off-street parking facilities:



      1.   Off-street parking facilities shall be located as follows:



         a.   Single-Family Residential zones (R-1B, R-1C, R1D,
R-lE, R-lG, R-lH, R-1-JJ) off-street parking may be permitted in driveways in
the front, side, and rear yards of permitted uses in these zones, provided
all requirements of this appendix are met. Additionally, off-street parking
may be located in the minimum rear yard. Off-street parking areas, including
driveways, located in the front yard in a single-family residential zone may
not be greater than ten feet wide unless the ratio of unpaved area to paved
area (grass area to parking and driveway areas) in the front yard is at least
two to one. However, the Board of Adjustment may grant a variance to the
two-to-one ratio if it determines that construction of the paved area will
not adversely affect adjacent property owners.



         b.   Multi-Family residential and mobile home park zones
(R-2, R-3, R-4, RMHP): Off-street parking is permitted in minimum required
side or rear yards of permitted uses in these zones. Off-street parking may
be permitted in required front yards, only if approved by the Planning
Commission according to the required site plan.



         c.   Special Development Zones (PUD, RCD, MLU):
Off-street parking shall be located as designated on the approved site plan.



         d.   Commercial and industrial zones (CBD, IP). Except
as herein provided, off-street parking may be permitted in minimum required
front, side, and rear yards of these zones in accordance with a site plan
that is approved by the Planning Commission.



      2.   All off-street parking facilities shall be located on the
same lot or zoning lot as the building served except for the following:



         a.   Permitted uses located within multi-family and
industrial zones may supply off-street parking within 300 feet from the lot
served, upon approval of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, providing
that the off street parking facilities are unable to be provided on the same
lot or contiguous to the same lot as the building being served. In addition,
the off-street parking shall be located in the same zone as the use being
served.



         b.   Existing single, two, or multi-family dwellings,
which are permitted uses herein and occupy a lot of such size that off-street
parking could not be provided on the same lot as the use being served, said
off-street parking may be permitted to locate within a distance not to exceed
300 feet from the dwelling upon approval of the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator. In addition, the off street parking lot shall be located in
the same zone as the use being served.



         c.   Off-street parking, as required for conditional
uses may be permitted to locate on another lot than the building or use being
served is located, when approved by the Board of Adjustment, provided that
the parking is located within reasonable walking distance of the use or
building being served and available at all times without restrictions for
those purposes.



         d.   Off-street parking facilities for uses permitted in
the CBD Zone may be located on another zoning lot provided that it is located
within the boundaries of the CBD Zone and approved by the Planning Commission.



   D.   Collective parking provision: collective off-street parking
facilities may be provided; however, the area for parking facilities shall
not be less than would otherwise be individually required except as provided
under division E. below.



   E.   Shared parking provision:



      1.   When any land or building is under the same ownership or
upon submission of satisfactory guarantees of the continued operation and
proper maintenance of the shared parking facility, and proposed development
is for two or more land uses excluding residential uses, the number of
minimum required parking spaces shall be computed by multiplying the minimum
number of parking spaces normally required for each land use by the
appropriate percentage as shown in the following shared parking credit table
for each of the five time periods shown. The number of parking spaces
required is then determined by adding the results in each column: the column
total that generates the highest number of parking spaces becomes the minimum
parking requirement.

      2.   The following requirements shall apply to any shared
parking facility for mixed use development.



         a.   The shared parking facility must be located within
500 feet walking distance of the entrance to the establishment to be served.
Said walkway access shall provide a safe means of pedestrian access to and
from the establishment being served.



         b.   Reserved spaces shall not be shared.



         c.   It shall be determined at the time of parking
facility plan approval that shared parking is possible and appropriate at the
location proposed. Particular attention is needed to assure that sufficient
and convenient short-term parking will be available to commercial
establishments during the weekday daytime period. The short-term shared
parking spaces must be located in the most convenient and visible area of the
parking facility nearest the establishment being served.



         d.   Any subsequent change in use shall require the
issuance of a new zoning permit and proof that minimum parking requirements,
per these regulations, will be met.



         e.   Shared parking may be utilized for other uses,
which are not shown in the parking credit table. The applicant shall prepare
a similar calculation for the proposed uses, indicating the estimated
percentage of each time period, based upon current parking information.
Documentation shall be submitted by the applicant to demonstrate that the
normal and regular operating hours of the uses proposing a shared parking
arrangement do not coincide or overlap in any manner.



   F.   Driveways not computed as part of required parking area:
entrances, exits, or driveways shall not be computed as any part of a
required parking lot or area, except in the case of single-family residential
zones, where access driveways may be used for parking.



   G.   Off-street parking space to be used for parking only: any
vehicle parking space shall be used for parking only. Any other use of such
space, including repair work or servicing of any kind other than in an
emergency, or the requirement of any payment for the use of that space, shall
be deemed to constitute a separate commercial use in violation of the
provisions of this appendix.



   H.   No building shall be erected in off-street parking space: no
building of any kind shall be erected in any off-street parking lot, except a
parking garage containing parking spaces equal to the requirements set forth
in this section or a shelter house booth for a parking attendant providing
the number of spaces required are not reduced.



   I.   Parking plan approval required: plans for all parking lot
facilities, including parking garages, shall be submitted to the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator for review and for compliance with the
provisions of this appendix and such other pertinent ordinances of the city.
These plans shall show the number of spaces and arrangements of parking
aisles, location of access points onto adjacent streets, provisions for
vehicular and pedestrian circulation, location of sidewalks and curbs on or
adjacent to the property, utilities, location of shelters for parking
attendant, locations of signs, typical cross-sections of pavement, base and
subbase proposed grade of parking lot, storm drainage facilities, location
and type of lighting facilities and such other information or plans as the
circumstances may warrant. Where parking plans include provisions for access
points to adjacent streets, then those plans shall also be prepared in
accordance with the requirements of § 11.3.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 11.2  DESIGN AND LAYOUT OF OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS.



   A.   Size of off-street parking spaces: for the purposes of this
appendix, one parking space shall be a minimum of 162 square feet in area,
exclusive of access drives or aisles, and shall be a minimum of nine feet in
width and eighteen feet (18') in length. However, a maximum of fifteen
percent (15%) of the number of required parking spaces may be a minimum of
128 square feet in area, exclusive of access drives or aisles, and a minimum
of eight feet (8') in width and sixteen feet (16') in length so long as each
such parking space is designated in plain view as for use of compact cars
only. The parking space shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven
feet (7').



   B.   Width of access drives:



      1.   All off-street parking areas shall be laid out with the
following minimum aisle or access drive widths:



         a.   Ninety (90) degree (perpendicular) parking: twenty
two feet (22') (either one or two-way circulation);



         b.   Sixty (60) degree (angle) parking: fifteen (15)
feet (one-way circulation only);



         c.   Forty-five (45) (angle) parking: twelve (12) feet
(one way-circulation only);



         d.   Thirty (30) degree (angle) parking: eleven (11)
feet (one-way circulation only);



         e.   Zero degree (parallel) parking: 12 feet (one-way
circulation).



      2.   When any combination of these types of parking is used
(facing the same aisle), the most restricted aisle or access drive width
requirements shall prevail. In addition, a two foot (2') overhang may be
permitted on the external sides of a parking area. If the width of the
parking space is increased over nine feet (9'), the drive aisle width can be
decreased two feet (2') in width in drive the aisle per one foot (1')
increase in space width, except that a drive aisle for two-way traffic may
not be decreased below twenty feet (20') in width and a drive aisle for
one-way traffic may not be decreased below eleven feet (11') in width.



   C.   Access to off-street parking spaces: access to off-street
parking spaces. Each required parking space shall be connected with a deeded
public right-of-way by means of aisles or access drives as required by
division B. of this section. The parking area shall be so designated to
ensure that all maneuvering into and out of each parking space shall take
place entirely within property lines of lots, garages, or storage areas.



   D.   Off-street parking areas in multi-family, commercial, or
Industrial zones: all such parking areas shall have a protective wall or
bumper blocks around the perimeter of the parking area and shall be so
designed that all vehicles leaving the facility will be traveling forward to
approaching traffic. All perking shall be effectively screened on each side
adjoining or fronting on any property situated in a zone permitting
single-family residential development, by a solid wall, fence or densely
planted compact hedge as regulated by § 154.052. Ground cover shrubs and
trees shall be located and maintained so as to not interfere with vehicular
and pedestrian traffic on the property or with sight distance clearances at
entrances and exits.



   E.   Lighting: any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking
areas shall not glare upon any right-of-way or adjacent property.



   F.   Paving of new off-street parking: all new off-street parking
facilities shall be paved with asphalt concrete or Portland Cement concrete
and shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the applicable
standards adopted by the city council.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)

SECTION 11.4  ACCESS CONTROL REGULATIONS.



   In order to promote greater safety of passage between highway and land;
improve the convenience and ease of movement of travelers on the highway;
permit reasonable speeds and economy of travel; and increase and protect the
capacity of the highway, the location and design of access points shall be in
accordance with the following access control requirements, these requirements
shall apply to all arterial and collector type streets as identified in the
adopted Comprehensive Plan:



   A.   Provision of reserved turning lanes: at those access points
where vehicles turning to and from the arterial and collector streets will
affect the roadway capacity reserved turn lanes shall be constructed by the
developer.



   B.   Provision of frontage road: where possible, provision for the
construction of a frontage road shall be made. However, access to the
arterial or collector streets via an intersecting street or a common driveway
shall be investigated if the design is not reasonable.



   C.   Coordination of access ponts: major access points on opposite
sides of the arterial and collector streets shall be located opposite each
other, otherwise turning movement restrictions may be imposed by the Planning
Commission or City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, whichever is applicable in
addition, in order to maximize the efficient utilization of access points,
access drive shall be designed, located, and constructed in a manner to
provide and make possible the coordination of access with and between
adjacent properties developed (present or future) for similar uses. As a
condition of approval for construction, use, or reuse of any access road, the
City Inspector/Zoning Administrator may require that unobstructed and
unencumbered access, in accordance with the provisions of this appendix, be
provided from any access point to adjacent properties.



   D.   Spacing restrictions for signalized access points:



      1.   Access points which will warrant signalization shall be
spaced a minimum distance of 1/4 miles apart. The exact location of the
signal light shall be determined by a traffic engineering study which shall
at least account for the following variables:



         a.   Speed;



         b.   Traffic signal phasing;



         c.   Traffic signal cycle length;



         d.   Roadway geometrics; and



         e.   Accident experience



      2.   Provision for all turning movements to maintain the
design capacity of the roadway shall be required.



   E.   Sight distance: the location of access points shall comply with
safe sight distance requirements as provided in Table 1 of this section. The
centerline of all access points shall intersect as nearly at a 90 degree
angle as possible, but in no case shall the angle of intersection be less
than 75 degrees or greater than 105 degrees, unless approved by the Planning
Commission or City inspector/Zoning Administrator, whichever is applicable,
due to certain exceptional conditions.



   F.   Location of un-signalzied access point:



      1.   Arterial streets.



         a.   Un-signalized access points shall be spaced a
minimum distance of 600 feet apart. Turning restrictions or reserved turn
lanes may be required.



         b.   One access point per existing tract will be
permitted; however, if the spacing requirements for a direct access point
onto an arterial street (as provided in division F.1.a. above) cannot be met,
then an access point may be located on a frontage road or on an intersecting
local street, or share a common driveway that meets the spacing requirements.
In order for the intersecting local street or frontage road to function
properly, access onto them should be controlled as follows:



            1)   Access points onto local streets intersecting
an arterial street shall be spaced a minimum distance of 100 feet, measured
from point of curb return to point of curb return, from the arterial street.



            2)   In areas zoned to permit commercial,
industrial, or multi-family residential use, access points from adjacent
properties onto frontage roads, shall be no less than 100 feet measured from
point of curb return to point of curb return from intersections of the
frontage road with local or collector streets.



         c.   Where the frontage of a tract is greater than 500
feet an additional access point may be permitted; however, the type of access
will depend on the spacing requirements in division F.1.a. of this section.
If the frontage of the tract is large enough, then at least one of the access
points may have direct access onto the arterial street, provided the spacing
between the adjacent access points meet the requirements of division F.1.a.
of this section and all other requirements of this section. In the case where
the frontage allows only one point of direct access due to spacing
restrictions as provided herein, the second access point will be via a
frontage road or an intersecting local street, or share a common driveway
that meets the spacing restrictions as provided along the arterial street.



         d.   If a tract of land has no means of access that
would meet the requirements of this section, one access point shall be
provided. However, all such access points shall be considered a temporary
right-of-way and may be terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning
movements, or caused to be relocated by the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator at that time as the particular use served by the access point
changes or the property is otherwise provided an alternate means of access
via a frontage road or an intersecting local street or sharing of a common
driveway. Provisions for the construction of a frontage road, restricted
turning movements, or other improvements, may be required, as a condition to
approval, in order to minimize the number of access points and congestion to
the adjacent street. In all cases where access points are classified as
temporary, the designation shall be duly noted on the plot plan or site plan
submitted for a zoning permit and also upon the deed of the property in
question.



      2.   Collector streets.



         a.   On two lane roadway, one access point per existing
tract will be allowed; however, if the frontage is greater than 500 feet, an
additional access point may be permitted. Furthermore, the minimum spacing
between adjacent access points on this type of facility shall be 100 feet,
measured from point of curb return to point of curb return, except in the
case where the street intersects another collector street or arterial street,
then the access points shall be spaced a minimum of 300 feet from the
intersection.



         b.   On multi-lane roadways the spacing is dependent on
whether or not a barrier median exists (prohibiting left turn movements). If
a barrier median exists, access points may be spaced as close as 300 feet;
however, certain turning movements will be prohibited. If a barrier median
does not exist, then the minimum spacing of access points shall be 600 feet.
In addition, some turning movements may be prohibited.



         c.   One access point per existing tract will be
allowed; however, if the spacing requirements for a direct access point, as
provided in division F.2.a. of this section, cannot be met, then an access
point may be located on a frontage road or on an intersecting street or share
a common driveway that meets the spacing requirements.



         d.   If a tract of land has no means of access that
would meet the requirements of this section, one access point shall be
provided. However, all such access points shall be considered a temporary
right-of-way and may be terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning
movements or caused to be relocated by the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator at that time as the particular use served by the access point
changes, or the property is otherwise provided an alternate means of access
via a frontage road or an intersecting local street or share a common
driveway. Provisions for the construction of a frontage road, restricted
turning movements, or other improvements, may be required, as a condition to
approval, in order to minimize the number of access points and congestion to
the adjacent street. In all cases where access points are classified as
temporary, the designation shall be duly noted on the plot plan or site plan
submitted for a zoning permit and also upon the deed of the property in
question.



   G.   Width of access points:



      1.   In single-family residential zones, no access point width
shall be less than nine feet, nor more than 20 feet. In all other zones,
access points shall not be less than 12 feet, nor more than 48 feet in width.
The width shall be as measured from the point of curb return to point of curb
return (or edge of pavement if no curb exists) excluding the curb radius.



      2.   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator may modify
(enlarge or reduce) the width to provide for a more efficient and safe
channelization of flow of traffic.



   H.   Exceptions to access points requirements: where situations
develop that may require special treatment, the requirements as provided in
§ 11.3 first six types of uses, may be varied provided that a traffic
engineering report is prepared by a qualified traffic engineer, establishing
that the special treatment will have no adverse effects on the roadway safety
and capacity.



   I.   Access point problem areas: if after special study, it is
determined that the type of use or activity proposed would have an adverse
effect on the safety and capacity of the adjacent roadway, the access point
spacing requirements as contained in this section may have to be increased in
order to adequately solve the traffic movement.



   J.   Approval of access points required: plans for all access points
and modification access points thereto (including plans to use existing
access points where a change of use for any tract of land would generate more
traffic than the previous use, thus producing an adverse effect on the
adjacent roadway) shall be submitted to the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator and the Northern Kentucky Area Planning Commission staff, at a
scale not less than one equals 100 feet. No action of approving or rejecting
these plans by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall be taken until a
review and recommendation of the plans has been made by the Northern Kentucky
Area Planning Commission staff. The plans shall show the location of all
access points, and access points within 600 feet in either direction.



The proposed access point shall include typical cross sections of pavement,
the base and subbase, proposed grade and storm drainage, and any other
information or plans that the circumstances may warrant. If the access points
are being located in conjunction with off-street parking or loading and
unloading facilities, then those plans shall also include parking and
off-street loading or unloading plans, in accordance with §§ 11.0 through
12.2.



   K.   Approval of access points along state-maintained routes by
Kentucky Department of Transportation: a copy of the plans for all access
points to be constructed along a state-maintained route shall also be
submitted to the Kentucky Department of Transportation for review and
approval during the same time as plans are submitted to the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator, as provided for in § 11.3.



   L.   No access point plans shall be approved or permits issued for
construction by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator until these access
point plans have been approved by the Kentucky Department of Transportation.

ARTICLE XII  OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING REGULATIONS



SECTION 12.0 OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING REGULATIONS.



   For all buildings and structures erected, altered, or extended, and all
uses of land established as specified therein, after the effective date of
this appendix, off-street loading and/or unloading facilities shall be
provided as required by the regulations herein. However, where a building
permit has been issued prior to the date of the adoption of this appendix,
and provided that construction has not begun within 90 days of such effective
date, off-street loading or unloading facilities in the amounts required by
this appendix shall prevail.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 12.1  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



   A.   Spaces required:



      1.   a.   Every building, structure, or part thereof,
erected and occupied for uses permitted in commercial and industrial zones,
including conditional uses permitted in residential zones, involving the
receipt or distribution of vehicles, materials, or merchandise and having up
to 5,000 square feet of gross floor area shall be provided with at least one
loading or unloading space. A study shall be prepared by the company or
operator to determine the additional loading or unloading space needs over
and above the first space required for the specific use proposed. In
determining the number of spaces needed, the study shall take into
consideration the following:



            1)   Estimated and projected arrival and departure
rates for scheduled and unscheduled (random) trucks;



            2)   Estimated and projected length of truck stop
duration for loading or unloading of each truck;



            3)   Estimated number of trips by vehicle type
(such as two axle vehicles, semi-tractor trailers, and the like) and size.



         b.   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall
review the study of estimated and projected loading or unloading needs and
make a determination if the number of spaces provided is adequate for the use
proposed.



      2.   If it is determined by the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator, based on existing conditions of the proposed site, the design
of the building, and the completed needs study, that additional loading or
unloading spaces are needed to accommodate the facilities than could be
reasonably provided, the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall require
that additional parking areas, properly designed, to handle the parking of
necessary trucks including the maneuvering of the trucks to and from the
necessary trucks including the maneuvering of the trucks to and from the
space, be provided for the storage of trucks waiting to be loaded or unloaded.



      3.   If after approval by the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator of the number of spaces and any storage of truck parking needed
to accommodate the loading and unloading of trucks for a specific use, a need
exists, based on operation of the specific use, to provide additional
off-street loading and unloading spaces or storage of trucks than was
previously determined, the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator may require
that corrective action be taken to eliminate any deficiencies as follows:



         a.   Limit the time and interval of arrival and
departure of trucks commensurate with the need; or



         b.   Require necessary additional loading or unloading
spaces, or require that adequate parking areas be provided for the storage of
trucks waiting to be loaded or unloaded.



   B.   Additional loading or unloading spaces to be provided: whenever
the intensity of any use of a building or premises is increased through
addition of gross floor area, change of use or increased activity, additional
loading or unloading spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
requirements of division A. above, if it is determined by the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator that the existing spaces are not adequate to
serve the increase in intensity.



   C.   Location of off-street loading and unloading area: all required
loading and/or unloading spaces shall be located on the same zoning lot as
the use served. However, permitted uses located in industrial zones may
provide parking areas for the storage of trucks waiting to be loaded or
unloaded within 300 feet from each lot served, upon the approval of the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator, providing that the off-street storage of
trucks are unable to be provided on the same lot or contiguous to the same
lot as the use being served and further provided that the storage of trucks
is located in the same zone as the use being served. Loading or unloading
areas may be located in the side and minimum required rear yards, provided
that all loading or unloading facilities shall be set back a minimum of ten
feet from the rear lot line and minimum side yard clearances are maintained.



   D.   Driveways not computed as part of required laoding or unloading
area. Entrances, exits, or driveways shall not be computed as any part of a
required loading or unloading space.



   E.   Off-street loading and unloading space to be used for loading
and unloading only: any loading or unloading space shall be used for loading
or unloading only. Any other use of such space, including repair work or
servicing of any kind other than in an emergency, or the requirement of any
payment for the use of such space, shall be in violation of the provisions of
this appendix.



   F.   No building to be erected in off-street loading or unloading
Space: no building of any kind shall be erected in any off-street loading or
unloading space.



   G.   Off-street loading or unloading space shall not be reduced: the
required parking spaces as set forth and designated in this appendix shall
not be reduced, except as provided for in this appendix.



   H.   Loading or unloading plan approval required: plans for all
loading or unloading facilities shall be submitted to the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator for review and for compliance with the
provisions of this appendix and any other pertinent ordinances of the City
Council. These plans shall show the number and location of loading or
unloading spaces, including necessary maneuvering of trucks and dock and
apron approach, and arrangements for truck circulation, location of curbs on
or adjacent to the property, utilities, location of signs, typical cross
sections of pavement, including base and subbase, proposed grade of lot,
storm drainage facilities, location and type of lighting facilities, and any
other information of plans as the circumstance may warrant. Where loading or
unloading plans include provisions for access points to adjacent streets,
then those plans shall also be prepared in accordance with the requirements
of § 11.4.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 12.2 DESIGN AND LAYOUT OF OFF-STREET LOADING OR UNLOADING AREAS.



   A.   Size of off-street loading or unloading space: each off-street
loading or unloading space shall be at least 14 feet in width and at least 60
feet in length, exclusive of aisle and maneuvering spaces and shall have a
vertical clearance of at least 15 feet. However, when it is demonstrated that
a particular loading or unloading space will be used by shorter trucks, as
provided for in § 12.1.A., the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator may
reduce the minimum length to not less than 35 feet.



   B.   Access:



      1.   Each required off-street loading or unloading space shall
be designed with direct access via an approved access drive, to a deeded
right-of-way which offers efficient ingress, egress, and safety for trucks.
Access drives or aisles shall be laid out with a width of at least 12 feet
for one-way circulation and at least 22 feet for two-way circulation with
intersection radii not to be less than 50 feet.



      2.   Off-street loading or unloading space shall be so
designed and constructed so that all maneuvering for loading or unloading can
take place entirely within the property lines of the premises being served.
These off-street loading or unloading spaces shall be so located as not to
hinder the free movement of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk or
street.



   C.   Other design features: docks are to be designed to facilitate
efficient loading or unloading. Platform heights should be 44 inches for
light pickup and delivery trucks and 48 through 52 inches for heavy trucks
and trailers. The dock area should be at least twice the total body floor
area of the largest number of trucks that can be docked at one time. Minimum
dock overhead clearance (including pipes, lights and the like) should be 12
feet.



   D.   Paving of off-street loading or unloading area: all off-street
loading or unloading areas, including spaces, maneuvering, and storage areas
for truck parking shall be paved with asphalt concrete or Portland cement
concrete and shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Appendix A
of this appendix.



   E.   Lighting: any lighting used to illuminate off-street loading or
unloading areas shall not glare upon any right-of-way or adjacent property.



   F.   Screening and landscaping: all loading or unloading areas
including storage of parked trucks, shall be effectively screened on each
side adjoining or fronting on any property situated in a residential zone as

Octave, Half Octave, and Third Octave Band Filter Sets S1.11 - 1966, American
National Standards Institute, 1430 Broadway, New Your, New York 10018, or the
latest edition of such standards, shall be used). In the enforcement of the
regulation, noises produced by the operation of motor vehicles or other
transportation facilities shall not be included in determining the maximum
permitted decibel level. In the I-P District, the sound pressure of noise
radiated continuously from any activity shall not exceed the value given in
Tables I and 2 of this section, at the location of any receiving land use. If
the noise is not smooth and continuous, one or more of the corrections in
Table 2 of this section shall be added or subtracted from each of the decibel
levels given in Table 1 below.



      2.   In the I-1 District the sound pressure of noise radiated
from any activity shall not exceed the values given in Table 3 below in any
octave band frequency at any point on or beyond any lot line. If the I-P or
I-1 Districts adjoin a residential district, the maximum sound pressure level
at any point on the district boundary shall be reduced by six decibels from
the maximum listed in Table 3 below.



      3.   In the I-2, I-4, and I-5 Districts, the sound pressure of
noise radiated from any activity shall not exceed the value given in Table 3
below in any octave band frequency at any point on or beyond the nearest
district boundary. If those districts adjoin a residential district, the
maximum sound pressure shall be reduced by six decibels from the maximum
listed in Table 3 below.



      4.   In all districts, industrial noise shall be muffled so as
not to become objectionable due to intermittence, beat, frequency, or
shrillness.



      5.   Table 1. Maximum permissible sound pressure level at
specified points of measurement for noise radiated continuously from a
facility.

inconsistent with this appendix, shall be valid for a period of 180
consecutive calendar days from time of issuance of the permit. If

permits, zoning permits and building permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator authorize

building or premises or part thereof, hereafter created, changed, converted
or enlarged, wholly or partly, until a certificate of occupancy shall have
been issued by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator. Such certificate
shall show that such building or premises or part thereof and the proposed
use thereof are in conformity with the provisions of this appendix. It shall
be the duty of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator to sign a certificate
of occupancy provided that he has checked and is satisfied that the building
and the proposed use thereof conform with all the requirements of this
appendix and the Building Code.



   A.   Certificate of occupancy for existing building: upon written
request from the fee owner, the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall
issue a certificate of occupancy for any building or premises existing at the
time of enactment of this appendix, certifying, after inspection, the extent
and kind of use made of the building or land, and whether such use conforms

certificate.



      2.   Applications for such certificates of occupancy for
nonconforming uses of land and buildings shall be filed with the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator by the owner or lessee of the land or building
occupied by such nonconforming uses within six consecutive calendar months of
the effective date of this appendix. Failure to apply for such certificate of
occupancy will place upon the owner and lessee the entire burden of proof
that such use of land or buildings lawfully existed on the effective date of
this appendix.



      3.   It shall be the duty of the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator to issue a certificate of occupancy for lawful nonconforming
uses upon application and such certificate shall identify the extent to which

of occupancy shall be kept on file in the office of the City Inspector/Zoning

ENFORCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.



   A.   Where investigation can be made by the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator or other designated employee using equipment normally available
to the City Council, the investigation shall be so made before notice of
violation is issued.



   B.   Where technical complexity, non-availability of equipment, or
extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable, in the opinion of the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator for the City Council to maintain the personnel
or equipment necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations,
procedures shall be established for:



      1.   Causing corrections in apparent violations of performance
standards;



      2.   For protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious and
unreasonable administration and enforcement of performance standard
regulations; and



      3.   For protecting the general public from unnecessary costs
for administration and enforcement.



   C.   If the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator finds, after
investigations have been made by qualified experts, that there is a violation
of the performance standards, he shall take or cause to be taken lawful
action to cause correction to within limits set by such performance standards.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 16.6  CITY INSPECTOR/ZONING ADMINISTRATOR; DUTIES REGARDING
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.



   If, in the judgment of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, there
is probably violation of the performance standards as set forth, the
following procedures shall be followed:



   A.   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall give written
notice, by registered mail or certified mail, to the person or persons
responsible for the alleged violation. The notice shall describe the
particulars of the alleged violation and the reasons why the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator believes there is a violation in fact, and
shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation to the
satisfaction of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator within 30 consecutive
calendar days of receipt of the notification. The notice shall state that
failure to reply or to correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of
the Zoning Commission within 30 consecutive calendar days of receipt of the
notice constitutes admission of violation of the terms of this appendix.



   B.   The notice shall further state that upon request of those to
whom said notice is directed, a technical investigation will be made by a
qualified expert and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of such
investigations shall be charged against those responsible for the violations,
in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is
determined that no violation exists, the cost of the investigation will be
paid by the City Council.



   C.   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days of
receipt of the notice, but the alleged violation is corrected to the
satisfaction of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, he shall note
“violation corrected” on his copy of the notice, and shall retain it
among his official records, taking such other action as may be warranted.



   D.   If there is no reply within 30 consecutive calendar days of
receipt of the notice and the alleged violation is not corrected to the
satisfaction of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, within the
established time limited, he shall proceed to take or cause to be taken such
action as is warranted by continuation of a violation after notice to cease.



   E.   If a reply is received within 30 consecutive calendar days of
receipt of the notice indicating that the alleged violation will be corrected
to the satisfaction of the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator, but,
requesting additional time, the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator may grant
an extension if they deem it warranted in the circumstances of the case and
if the extension will not, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life,
health, or property.



   F.   1.   If a reply is received within 30 consecutive calendar
days of receipt of the notice requesting technical determination as provided
in this appendix, and if the alleged violations continue, the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall call in properly qualified experts to
investigate and determine whether violations exist.



      2.   If expert findings indicate violations of the performance
standards, the costs of the investigations shall be assessed against the
properties or persons responsible for the violations in addition to such
other penalties as may be appropriate under the terms of § 18.11.



      3.   If no violation is found, the costs of the investigations
shall be paid by the City Council without assessment against the properties
of persons involved.

amendment to this appendix may originate with the Planning Commission, the
City Council, or with the owner of the property in question. Regardless of

Commission for its action before adoption by the City Council.



   C.   Public hearing required, notice given: the Planning Commission
shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposed amendment, at which
hearing parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be
heard. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published at
least once, but may be published two or more times in a newspaper of general
circulation in the County provided that one publication occurs not less than
seven (7) calendar days nor more than twenty-one (21) calendar days before
the occurrence of the hearing.



   D.   Other hearing requirements, zoning map amendment: in addition
to the public hearing notice required in division C. above, the following
notices shall be given when a proposal is submitted to amend the official
zoning map;



      1.   Notice of the hearing shall be posted conspicuously on
the property, the classification of which is proposed to be changed. The
posting shall consist of one or more signs clearly depicting the following
information: current zoning classification of property; proposed zoning
classification; date, place, and time of public hearing; and contact where
additional information regarding hearing may be obtained; and



         a.   Notice of the hearing shall be given at least ten
(10) days in advance of the hearing by personal , courier or mail service
with return receipt requested, to the owners of all property adjoining the
property, the classification of which is proposed to be changed. Where the

such street or alley shall be considered adjoining property.



         b.   It shall be the duty of the applicant proposing the
amendment to furnish to the Planning Commission and/or their duly authorized
representative the names and addresses of the owners of all adjoining
properties.



   E.   Findings necessary for map amendment: before any map amendment

making of a written report, setting forth explicitly the reasons and
substantiation as to how each would apply, and the finding and report shall
be recorded in the minutes and records of the Planning Commission or City
Council.



      1.   That the original zoning classification given to the
property was inappropriate or improper; or



      2.   That there have been major changes of an economic,
physical, or social nature within the area involved which were not
anticipated in the Comprehensive Plan and which have substantially altered
the basic character of that area.

be adopted whereby the zoning classification of an area is changed unless the
total area being applied for meets the following requirements as to minimum
size: the zoning map shall not be amended, changed, or modified in a manner
as to create a free standing zone of less than five acres, except where
specific area restrictions are stipulated in this appendix, or as outlined in
the adopted Comprehensive Plan by the Planning Commission. For the purpose of
computing the total size of an area to be rezoned for compliance herewith,
there shall be added to such area: the area of public rights-of-way interior
to the area being changed; one-half the area of public rights-of-way abutting
the area being changed; and the area of any land which is contiguous to the
area being changed (including land located outside the jurisdiction of the
City but contiguous thereto and which land already bears the zoning
classification sought for the area being changed). For the purpose of this
section, neither continuity nor abutment shall be destroyed by the existence

review those recommendations and take action to approve or disapprove the
proposed development plan. The approval may incorporate any conditions
imposed by the City Council. However, should the City Council take action to
impose different conditions than were reviewed and recommended by the
Planning Commission, then those conditions shall be resubmitted to the
Planning Commission for further review and recommendations in accordance with
the process required for the initial review.



            2)   Approval of the zoning map amendment shall
require that development be in accordance with the approved development plan.
Additionally, upon approval of the zoning map amendment, the official zoning
map shall be amended for the approved area.



         d.   1)   The City Council shall forward a copy of
the approved development plan to the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator

accordance with the applicable requirements of this appendix.



            2)   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator
and/or their duly authorized representative, in reviewing the site plan, may
authorize minor adjustments from the approved development plan, provided that
the adjustments do not: affect the spatial relationship of structures, change
land uses, increase overall density, alter circulation patterns (vehicular
and pedestrian), decrease the amount or usability of open space or recreation
areas, or affect other applicable requirements of this appendix.



      2.   Amendments: any amendments to plans, except for the minor
adjustments which may be permitted by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator
and/or their duly authorized representative as noted above, shall be made in
accordance with the procedure required by this appendix, subject to the same
limitations and requirements as those under which those plans were originally
approved.



      3.   Expiration: the zoning map amendment shall be subject to
the time constraint, as noted below. Upon expiration of the time period and
any extensions thereto, the City Council may initiate a request for a public
hearing by the Planning Commission, in accordance with the requirements of
KRS Chapter 100, for the purpose of determining whether said zoning map
amendment should revert to its original designation. A public hearing may be
initiated if either of the following conditions apply:

Commission within a twelve (12) months period from the date of final approval
of the zoning map amendment by the city;

within a twelve (12) months period from the date of approval of the site plan
by the Planning and Zoning Commission.



         c.   A written extension was not permitted by the city,
Planning Commission or its duly authorized representative. An extension may
be permitted upon approval of the Planning Commission if sufficient proof can
be demonstrated that the construction was delayed due to circumstances beyond
the applicant’s control, and that prevailing conditions have not changed
appreciably to render the approved development plan obsolete. The amount of
construction that constitutes initiating substantial construction shall be as
approved in the approved development plan.

   A.   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any
final action of the Board of Adjustment shall appeal from the action to the
circuit court of the county in which the property, which is the subject of
the action of the Board of Adjustment, lies. Such appeal shall be taken
within 30 days after the final action of the Board. All final actions, which
have not been appealed within 30 days, shall not be subject to judicial
review. The Board of Adjustment shall be a party in any such appeal filed in
the circuit court.



   B.   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any
final action of the Planning Commission shall appeal from the final action to
the circuit court of the county in which the property, which is the subject
of the commission’s action, lies. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days
after such action. Such action shall not include the commission’s
recommendations made to other governmental bodies. All final actions, which
have not been appealed within 30 days, shall not be subject to judicial
review. Provided, however, any appeal of a Planning Commission action
granting or denying a variance or conditional use permit authorized by KRS
100.203(5) shall be taken pursuant to this subsection. In such case, the 30
day period for taking an appeal begins to run at the time the City Council
grants or denies the map amendment for the same development. The Planning
Commission shall be a party in any such appeal filed in the circuit court.



   C.   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any
final action of the City Council relating to a map amendment shall appeal
from the action to the circuit court of the county in which the property,
which is the subject of the map amendment, lies. Such appeal shall be taken
within 30 days after the final action of the City Council. All final actions,
which have not been appealed within 30 days, shall not be subject to judicial
review. The City Council shall be a party in any such appeal filed in the
circuit court.



   D.   The owner of the subject property and applicants who initiated
the proceeding shall be made parties to the appeal. Other persons speaking at
the public hearing are not required to be made parties to such appeal.



   E.   For purposes of this appendix, final action shall be deemed to
have occurred on the calendar date when the vote is taken to approve or
disapprove the matter pending before the body.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 18.4  STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.



   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is
taken, certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal is
filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such
case proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a court of record on
application, or on notice to the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator from
whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 18.5  POWERS OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.



   Upon appeals, the Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:



   A.   To hear and decide on applications for dimensional variances
where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape
of a site on the effective date of this appendix, or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions, or some other extraordinary situation or condition of
that site, the literal enforcement of the requirements (height or width of
building or size of yards, but not population density) of the zoning chapter
would deprive the applicant of reasonable capacity to make use of the land.



   B.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged, by the
appellant, that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, grant
or refusal made by the City Inspector/Zoning Administrator in the enforcement
of this appendix. An appeal shall be taken within 60 consecutive calendar
days.



   C.   To hear and decide applications for conditional use permits to
allow the proper integration into the community of uses which are
specifically named herein which may be suitable only in specific locations in
the zone only if certain conditions are met as specified in § 9.14.



   D.   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this
appendix requests for interpretation of the official zoning map or for
decisions upon other special questions upon which the Board is authorized to
act upon.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 18.6  VARIANCES.



   A.   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide
on applications for variances. The Board may impose any reasonable conditions
or restrictions on any variance it decides to grant.



   B.   1.   Before any variance is granted, the Board must find
that the granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety, or welfare, will not alter the essential character of the
general vicinity, will not cause a hazard or nuisance to the public, and will
not allow an unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the zoning
regulations. In making these findings, the board shall consider whether:



         a.   That the requested variance arises from special
circumstances exist which do not generally apply to land in the general
vicinity, or in the same zone;



         b.   That the manner in which the strict application of
the provisions of the regulation would deprive the applicant of the
reasonable use of the land or would create an unnecessary hardship on the
applicant; and



         c.   The circumstances are the result of actions of the
applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from
which relief is sought.



      2.   The Board shall deny any request for a variance arising
from circumstances that are the result of willful violations of the zoning
regulation by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the zoning
regulations from which relief is sought.



   C.   The Board shall not possess the power to grant a variance or
permit a use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by
the zoning regulation in the zone in question, or to alter the density of
dwelling unit requirements in the zone in question.



   D.   A variance applies to the property for which it is granted and
not to the individual who applied for it. A variance also runs with the land
and is transferable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be
transferred by the applicant to a different site.



(Ord. 2017-6, passed 4-4-17)



SECTION 18.7  CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.



   A.   Conditional use permits shall not be issued without the
specific approval of the Board of Adjustment, as provided in this section.



   B.   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide
on applications for conditional use permits to allow the proper integration
into the community of uses which are specifically named in the zoning
regulations which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone only
if certain conditions are met:



      1.   The Board may approve, modify, or deny any application
for a conditional use permit. If it approves such permit it may attach
necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or more
things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a
continuing nature. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the Board’s
minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a reference to the
specific section in the zoning regulation listing the conditional use under
consideration. The Board shall have power to revoke conditional use permits,
or variances for noncompliance with the condition thereof. Furthermore, the
Board shall have a right of action to compel offending structures or uses
removed at the cost of the violator and may have judgment in personam for
such cost.



      2.   Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the
applicant from complying with all of the requirements of building, housing,
and other regulations.



      3.   In any case where a conditional use permit has not been
exercised within the time limit set by the Board, or within one year, if no
specific time limit has been set, such conditional use permit shall not
revert to its original designation unless there has been a public hearing.
“EXERCISED,” as set forth in this section, shall mean that binding
contracts for the construction of the main building or other improvement have
been let; or in the absence of contracts that the main building or other
improvement is under construction to a substantial degree, or that
prerequisite conditions involving substantial investment under contract, in
development, are completed. When construction is not a part of the use,
“EXERCISED” shall mean that the use is in operation in compliance with
the conditions as set forth in the permit.



      4.   The City Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall review all
conditional use permits, except for those which all conditions have been
permanently satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the power to
inspect the land or structure where the conditional use is located in order
to ascertain that the landowner is complying with all of the conditions which
are listed on the conditional use permit. If the landowner is not complying
with all of the conditions listed on the conditional use permit, the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall report the fact in writing to the
Chairperson of the Board of Adjustment. The report shall state specifically
the manner in which the landowner is not complying with the conditions on the
conditional use permit, and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the
landowner at the same time that it is furnished to the Chairperson of the
Board of Adjustment. The Board shall hold a hearing on the report within a
reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be
furnished to the landowner at least one week prior to the hearing. If the
Board of Adjustment finds that the facts alleged in the report of the City
Inspector/Zoning Administrator are true and that the landowner has taken no
steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the
hearing, the Board of Adjustment may authorize the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator to revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary
legal action to cause the termination of the activity on the land which the
conditional use permit authorizes.



      5.   Once the Board of Adjustment has completed a conditional
use permit and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be
completely and permanently satisfied, the City Inspector/Zoning
Administrator, upon request of the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make
a determination that the conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts
which indicate that the conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in
the margin of the copy of the conditional use permit which is on file.
Thereafter said use, if it continues to meet the other requirements of the
regulations, will be treated as a permitted use.



      6.   When an application is made for a conditional use permit
for land located within or abutting any residential zoning district, written
notice shall be given at least 15 days in advance of the public hearing on
the application to the applicant, City inspector/Zoning Administrator, the
Mayor and City Clerk of any city of the fifth or sixth class so affected,
within any county containing a city of the first class, an owner of every
parcel of property adjoining the property to which the application applies
and such other persons as the local zoning ordinance, regulations, or Board
of Adjustment bylaws shall direct. Written notice shall be by first class
mail with certification by the Board’s Secretary or other officer that the
notice was mailed. It shall be the duty of the applicant to furnish to the
Board the name and address of an owner of each parcel of property as
described in this division. Records maintained by the property valuation
administrator may be relied upon conclusively to determine the identity and
address of said owner. In the event such property is in condominium or
cooperative forms of ownership, then the person notified by mail shall be the
President or Chairperson of the owner group which administers property
commonly owned by the condominium or cooperative owners. A joint notice may
be mailed to two or more  co-owners of an adjoining property who are listed
in the property valuation administrator’s records as having the same
address.



      7.   When any property within the required notification area
for a public hearing upon a conditional use permit application is located
within an adjoining city, county, or planning unit, notice of the hearing
shall be given at least 14 days in advance of the hearing, by first-class
mail to certain public officials, as follows:



         a.   If the adjoining property is part of a planning
unit, notice shall be given to that unit’s planning commission; or



         b.   If the adjoining property is not part of a planning
unit, notice shall be given to the mayor of the city in which the property is
located or, if the property is in an unincorporated area, notice shall be
given to the judge/executive of the county in which the property is located.

Inspector/Zoning Administrator, from whom the appeal is taken.

the provisions of this appendix; or to decide in favor of the applicant on
any matter upon which it is required to pass under this appendix, or to

   (A)   Purpose.  These subdivision regulations as herein set forth
have been prepared in accordance with an adopted comprehensive plan for the
city to promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
city; to provide for the proper arrangement of streets in relation to
existing or proposed streets; to provide for adequate and convenient open
spaces for vehicular and pedestrian traffic, utilities, access of fire
fighting apparatus, recreation, light and air, and the avoidance of
congestion of the population, and to facilitate the orderly and efficient
layout and appropriate use of the land. In addition, these regulations also
provide for the accurate surveying of land, preparing and recording of plats
and the equitable handling of all subdivision plats by providing uniform
procedures and standards for observance by both the approving authority and
subdividers.



   (B)   Authority.  These regulations are adopted in accordance with
KRS 100.201 through 100.991.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 1.2 SCHEDULE OF CONSTRUCTION AND SALE OF LOTS.



   No lot, tract, or parcel in a subdivision in which the property is
located may be sold or transferred and no permit to erect any building upon
land in a subdivision may be issued unless a final plat has been approved by
the Planning Commission and recorded with the County Clerk of the county in
which the property is located, and until the construction of all improvements
required in connection therewith have been completed or guaranteed as
provided for in these regulations.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 1.3 SCHEDULE OF IMPROVEMENTS.



   The subdivider of any tract or parcel of land located within the city

the Planning Commission and acceptance by the City Council as provided for
herein.

SECTION 1.4 GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES.



   (A)   Subdivider and developer.  The subdivider or developer shall
use a land surveyor, and a civil engineer, registered in the state of
Kentucky to prepare plats and plans consistent with the design standards;
accomplish improvements consistent with the improvement requirements; and
process said plats and plans in accordance with these regulations.



   (B)   Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative, is charged with the duty of making investigations
and reports on the design and improvements of proposed subdivisions and
developments and requiring conformance of such subdivisions and developments
with the comprehensive plan for the city, KRS 100.111 through 100.991 and
these regulations. The Planning Commission shall require such redesign of
street patterns, lot layout, and such other information or plans so as to
accomplish the objectives and intent of the comprehensive plan and to insure
good traffic patterns, proper design and development of a particular area,
and appropriate consideration of abutting development.



   (C)   City Council.  Any street or other public ground which has
been dedicated shall not be accepted by the City Council until it has
received recommendations from the Planning Commission. No certificate of
occupancy shall be granted until the City Council accepts the improvements
for maintenance.

agreement and a bond acceptable to the city's Legal Counsel and the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative, are provided for the

reason, the subdivider or developer is unable to install the required
improvements. The amount of the bond shall be based on an estimate made by
the subdivider and approved by the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative (see Article VII, Section 7.20).  Upon
determination that all requirements of these regulations have been met, the
Planning Commission shall give final approval and shall indicate such
approval and date on the original drawing of the final plat.

disapprove the final plat, written notice of such action, including reference
to the regulation or regulations violated by the plat or the reasons for
disapproval shall be mailed to the subdivider or developer. The action shall
be entered on the official records of the Planning Commission.

Commission, or its duly authorized representative, shall cause to have made
at the expense of the subdivider or developer, four copies of the final plat

ARTICLE VI
DESIGN STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES FOR THE LAYOUT OF LAND SUBDIVISIONS



SECTION 6.0 STREETS.



   (A)   Conformity to comprehensive plan and/or official map. 
Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided or resubdivided includes any part
of a proposed arterial or collector street as designated on the comprehensive
plan and/or the official map, such street right-of-way shall be platted by
the subdivider in the location so designated and at the width indicated in
these regulations.



   (B)   Street extension.



      (1)   Existing streets.  The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provisions for the proper continuation of existing
streets in adjoining areas.



      (2)   Adjacent property. Where adjoining areas are not
subdivided and are appropriate for future subdivision, arrangement of streets
in new subdivisions shall make provisions for the proper projection of
streets to that adjoining area in a manner which shall provide for the
practical development of the adjacent property, permit a feasible extension
of the street, and be in general conformity with a plan for the most
advantageous development of the entire neighborhood.



      (3)   Half streets.  Dedication of one-half of the
rights-of-way (half streets) for streets proposed along the boundaries by
land to be subdivided, shall be prohibited.



      (4)   Dedication of one-foot strip next to undeveloped or 
unplatted land.  A one-foot strip of land shall be required along the
boundary line of subdivision wherever the right-of-way line of a street forms
such boundary next to undeveloped land. All one foot strips of land located
on dedicated rights-of- way shall be dedicated to the city for non-road
purposes.



   (C)   Street classification and function.



      (1)   Arterial streets.  Arterial streets should be planned
for continuation of movement of fast traffic between points of heavy traffic
generation and from one section of the community or communities to another.
Such arterial streets should traverse the entire community or communities and
should be spaced approximately one mile apart. Arterial streets should not
bisect neighborhoods but should act as boundaries between them. Abutting
properties should not face onto the roadway unless separated from it by a
frontage or service road.



      (2)   Collector streets.  Collector streets should be
designed to provide a traffic route from local streets to arterial streets.
These streets should be designed to carry traffic which has an origin or
destination within the neighborhood and should be designed to inhibit through
traffic.



      (3)   Local streets. Local streets shall provide direct and
full access to each lot and shall be laid out so that their use by through
traffic will be discouraged. Local streets intersecting with arterial streets
should be discouraged.



      (4)   Frontage roads. Frontage roads may be required along an
existing or proposed arterial street to provide access to lots along such
streets.



      (5)   Alleys. Where alleys are to be provided (e.g., in the
case of certain commercial development), they shall be designed to provide
only secondary access.



   (D)   Street rights-of-way.



      (1)   Widths and grades of new streets. Street right-of-way
widths and grades shall conform to the following minimum requirements:



TABLE 1
STREET RIGHTS-OF-WAY WIDTH AND GRADE REQUIREMENTS







* Arterial streets shall be based on current design standards and other
pertinent requirements of the Kentucky Department of Highways.



      (2)   Existing streets. Subdivisions platted along existing
streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way, if necessary, to meet the
minimum street width requirements set forth in Section 6.0 (D) (1) of these
requirements. Such dedication shall be in accordance with the following:



         (a)   At least the minimum right-of-way width shall be
dedicated where the subdivision is on both sides of an existing street.



         (b)   When the subdivision is located on only one side
of an existing street, one- half of the required width, measured from the
centerline of the right-of-way, shall be dedicated. However, in no case shall
the owner or owners of such property be forced to dedicate from their land
more than one- half of the required rights-of-way width.



   (E)   Curves and sight distance criteria.



      (1)   Horizontal curve. Where there is a change in the
alignment of a street along the centerline, a curve with a radius adequate to
insure safe sight distance shall be made. The minimum radii of curves shall
be:



 

STREET TYPE
 
MINIMUM CURVE RADIUS


Arterial
 
*


Collector
 
300


Local
 
100



 



      (2)   Sight distance. A minimum sight distance of 200 feet
shall be provided for local streets and 275 feet for collector streets.*



      (3)   Reverse curves. A tangent at least 100 feet shall be
provided between reverse curves for local streets and 200 feet for collector
streets.*



      (4)   Vertical curves. The minimum vertical curve length
required shall be calculated by multiplying the algebraic difference in
grades, times a "K" factor. Rounded "K" factors for the three street
classification types are as follows:*



         Local



            K=20 for both crest and sag curves



         Collector



            K=35 for both crest and sag curves



*Arterial streets shall be based on current design standards and other
pertinent requirements of the Kentucky Department of Highways.



   (F)   Cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets.



      (1)   Dead-end streets designed to be dead-end permanently,
shall not be longer than 600 feet, unless local topographic or other physical
conditions are such as to render these provisions impracticable, and shall be
provided with a turning circle having an outside pavement diameter (curb face
to curb face) of at least 80 feet and a street property line diameter of at
least 100 feet. If such street is of a temporary nature and a further
extension into adjacent land is anticipated, then said turning circle beyond
normal street width shall be in the nature of a dedication of the premises
included in said turning circle, but beyond the boundaries of the streets
proper. Such dedications shall be vacated to abutting property owners when
said dead-end street is legally extended into adjacent land. If such dead-end
street extends only one lot depth past a street intersection, no temporary
turning circle will be required.



      (2)   In the case of dead-end streets extending to the
boundary of the property, a one-foot strip within the dedicated right-of-way
shall be dedicated to the city for non-road purposes. Such dedication or
restriction shall be vacated or removed when the dead-end street is properly
extended.



   (G)   Street names.



      (1)   Duplication. The name of a new street shall not
duplicate existing or platted street names in Campbell County, or approximate
such names in spelling, or sound or pronunciation, or by the use of alternate
suffixes such as "Lane", "Way", "Drive", "Court", "Avenue", or "Street".



      (2)   Continuation of streets. New street names shall bear the
same name of any continuation of, or when in alignment with, an existing or
platted street.



      (3)   Approval of street names. All street names shall be
approved by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative,
before approval of the final plat.



   (H)   Alleys.



      (1)   Alleys shall be prohibited in residential zoning
districts.



      (2)   In commercial and industrial areas, adequate alleys
shall be provided where the design requires. Alleys shall not serve as part
of the required off-street parking, loading and/or unloading space required
by the zoning ordinance.



   (I)   Private streets.  New private streets or alleys shall not be
created or extended and existing ones shall, whenever practicable, be
dedicated to the public.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 6.1 INTERSECTIONS.



   (A)   Angle of intersection. The centerline of all streets shall
intersect as nearly at a 90 degree angle as possible, but in no case shall
the angle of intersection be less than 75 degrees or greater than 105 degrees
(unless a special modification is granted by the Planning Commission due to
certain exceptional conditions).



   (B)   Centerline offset of adjacent intersections. The use of
four-way type intersections shall be discouraged where possible and the use
of T-intersections shall be encouraged. Where T-intersections are used, the
following minimum centerline offsets of adjacent intersections shall be as
follows:



 

TYPE OF STREET
 
MINIMUM CENTERLINE OFFSET OF ADJACENT INTERSECTIONS IN FEET


Local --Local
 
150


Local --Collector
 
150


Collector --Collector
 
200



 



   (C)   Corner radii. Property lines at street intersections shall be
provided with a radius of not less than 15 feet. If because of certain
exceptional conditions, a modification is granted permitting an angle of
intersection less than 75 degrees, or greater than 105 degrees, then the
minimum radii shall be increased or decreased respectively.



   (D)   Grades approaching intersections. Grades approaching
intersections should not exceed 4% for a distance of not less than 100 feet
from the centerline of said intersections for local streets and 150 feet for
collector streets.



   (E)   Design adjacent to freeways, expressways or arterials. The
following principles and standards shall be used in the design of
subdivisions adjacent to freeways, expressways or arterials:



      (1)   Street design shall have the purpose of making adjacent
lots desirable by cushioning the impact of heavy traffic and of minimizing
the interference with traffic on such thoroughfares.



      (2)   The number of intersections with collector streets along
said thoroughfares shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable such
intersections shall be spaced not less than 1/4 mile apart. Frontage or
service roads shall be encouraged.



      (3)   Where frontage roads are not required, residential lots
adjacent to such thoroughfares shall be served by a local residential street
paralleling said thoroughfare at a generous lot depth therefrom or by a
series of cul-de-sacs or loop streets extending towards said thoroughfare
from a collector street.



      (4)   When the rear of any lot borders any such thoroughfare,
the subdivider or developer may be required to execute and deliver to the
city, an instrument, deemed sufficient by the city's Legal Counsel,
prohibiting the right of ingress and egress from said thoroughfare to said
lot. This may be in the form of a deed for a one-foot strip for non-road
purposes.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 6.2 EASEMENT.



   (A)   Utility easements.  Public utility easements at least 15 feet
in total width may be required along the rear and sides of lots where needed
for the accommodation of a public utility, drainage, or sanitary structures
or any combination of the foregoing. Where deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative, an additional easement
width shall be provided.



   (B)   Watercourses.  The subdivider shall dedicate rights-of-way or
provide easements for storm drainage purposes which conform substantially
with the lines of any natural watercourses, channels, streams, or creeks
which traverse the subdivision or for any new channel which is established to
substitute for a natural watercourse, channel stream or creek. Such
rights-of-way or easements shall be of a width which will provide for the
maintenance needs of the channel and incidental structures as determined by
the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 6.3 PHYSICAL CONSIDERATION.



   Subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the topography of
the land, to economize in the construction of drainage facilities, to reduce
the amount of danger, to minimize destruction of trees and topsoil and to
preserve such natural features as watercourses, unusual rock formations,
large trees, sites for historical significance, and other assets which, if
preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision and the
community.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 6.4 FLOOD HAZARDS.



   (A)   Prohibition of development in areas susceptible to flooding. 
Land subject to flooding or otherwise uninhabitable shall not be platted for
residential, commercial, or industrial uses or for any other use which may
increase the danger of health, life, property, or aggravate erosion or flood
hazards. Such land within the subdivision shall be set aside on the plat for
such uses as will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or
will not result in conditions contrary to the public welfare (e.g., use as
open space, extensive recreation use, conservation purposes). To insure that
lots will be located on land where they will provide flood-free sites, the
Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, may require the
subdivider to provide elevation and flood profiles sufficient to demonstrate
the sites will be free from the danger of flooding. Fill may be used in flood
danger areas to render lots habitable if such fill does not inhibit the flow
of the waters and thereby unduly increase flood heights in other areas and
meets with the approval of the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative. Such information shall be prepared by a registered civil
engineer.



   (B)   Stream easement.  If a stream flows through, or adjacent to,
the proposed subdivision, the plat shall provide for a storm water easement
or drainage right-of-way along the stream for a floodway of at least ten
feet. For the smaller streams, the plat shall provide for channel improvement
to enable them to carry all reasonable floods within banks. The floodway
easement shall be wide enough to provide for future enlargement of the stream
channels as adjacent areas become more highly developed and run-off rates are
increased.



   (C)   Streets.  Approval shall not be given for streets within a
subdivision which would be subject to inundation or flooding. All streets
must be located at elevations which will make them flood-free in order that
no portion of the subdivision would become isolated by floods.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 6.5 BLOCKS.



   (A)   Arrangement.  The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to
provide for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street
traffic. Blocks intended to be used for commercial or industrial purposes
shall be designed specifically for such uses with space set aside for
off-street parking and loading and/or unloading facilities as required by the
zoning ordinance.



   (B)   Length.  Blocks should not exceed 1200 feet.



   (C)   Width.  The width of blocks should ordinarily be sufficient
to allow for two tiers of lots except for double frontage lots as permitted
in Section 6.6 (B) (4) of these regulations.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 6.6 LOTS.



   (A)   Conformance to zoning.  All lots shall conform to or exceed
the requirements of the zoning ordinance. Each lot shall front onto a
publicly owned street, other than an alley.



   (B)   Lot frontage and width.



      (1)   Arterial street frontage.  No access onto an arterial
street shall be permitted from abutting properties except as provided for in
Section 6.0 (C)(4) of these regulations.



      (2)   Lot width.  The lot width at the minimum building
setback line shall not be less than that specified by the zoning district in
the zoning ordinance controlling said lot.



      (3)   Corner lots.  Corner lots shall have extra width to
permit conformance to the setback line on the side street.  In no case shall
a corner lot be so narrow that minimum zoning requirements of the zoning
ordinance cannot be met.



      (4)   Double frontage lots.  Lots shall not be laid out so
that they have frontage onto more than one street except:  (a)  when the
lots are adjacent to the intersection of two streets; or (b) when the rear of
the lot faces an arterial, freeway, expressway, railroad right-of-way, etc.
and the front of the lot faces onto a local residential street.



   (C)   Lot depth.



      (1)   Conformance to zoning.  Each lot shall be of such a
depth that front yard and rear yard requirements of the zoning ordinance,
plus a reasonable building site, shall be provided.



      (2)   Maximum depth.  The maximum depth of a lot shall not be
greater than three times the width of the lot, except lots which contain over
five acres of area.  Lots containing over five acres of area shall not be
less than 250 feet in width at any location.  Exceptional individual site
conditions may require variation from these requirements, as permitted by the
Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative.



      (3)   Extra depth and width in certain cases.  Fifty feet in
addition to the required lot depth may be required where a residential lot in
a subdivision backs up to a railroad right-of-way, a high pressure gasoline
or gas line, an arterial street, an industrial area or other existing land
use which may have a detrimental effect on the residential use of the
property, and where no street is provided at the rear of such lot.  Where a
residential lot has its side lot line adjacent to any of the aforementioned,
an appropriate additional width may also be required.



   (D)   Usable lots.



      (1)   Building lots.  All subdivisions shall result in the
creation of lots which are developable and capable of being built upon.  No
subdivision shall create lots which are impractical to improve due to
steepness of terrain, dangerous soil conditions, locations of watercourses,
or other natural physical limitations.



      (2)   Strips or parcels.  No remnants of property shall be
left which do not conform to lot requirements, or which are not required for
a private or public utility purpose, or which are not accepted by the city
and/or any other appropriate public body for an appropriate use.



      (3)   Side lot lines.  The side lot lines of all lots so far
as practicable, shall be at right angles to the street which the lot faces or
radial to the center of curvature, if such street is curved. In the case of a
cul-de-sac on which the lot faces, side lot lines shall be as nearly radial
to the center of curvature of the cul-de-sac as practicable.



   (E)   Large lots.  When land is subdivided into very large parcels
they should be of such shape and dimensions as to render possible the
re-subdivision of any such parcels at some later date into lots and streets
which meet the requirements of these regulations and of the zoning ordinance.



   (F)   Lot division.  No lot shall be divided by a city or county
boundary line.



   (G)   Yard requirement.  Yard requirements for lots within a
subdivision shall conform to the yard requirements set forth in the zoning
ordinance for the zoning district in which they are located.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 6.7 PEDESTRIAN WAYS.



   Where deemed necessary by the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative, pedestrian ways may be required and if provided,
they shall not exceed a 15% grade unless steps of an acceptable design, as
determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative,
are to be constructed.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 6.8 PUBLIC SITES.



   Where a proposed park or other recreational area, school site, or other
public ground identified in comprehensive plan is located in whole or in part
within the proposed subdivision, the Planning Commission may require a
reservation, as a condition precedent to final plat approval, not to exceed
two years, for the purchase of such public ground by the applicable public
body. If the city has adopted an official map and a short term capital
improvement program (as provided for in KRS 100.293 through 100.317) which
includes such park or other recreational area, school site, or other public
ground, then the Planning Commission may require a reservation, as a
condition precedent to final plat approval, not to exceed five years, for the
purchase of such public ground by the applicable public body.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



ARTICLE VII
IMPROVEMENTS



   The improvements which are hereby required shall be prepared by a
registered civil engineer and installed by the subdivider in accordance with
the provisions of these regulations and other regulations of the city and
state. These improvements shall be installed before the final plat is
approved (i.e., through conditional approval) or in lieu thereof, a bond
certified by the city's legal counsel as valid and enforceable by the city
may be accepted and shall be approved before approval of the final plat. Such
bond would secure to the city the actual construction and installation of
such improvements within a time required by the construction agreement and
according to the approved improvement plans.



   Prior to the commencement of any project involving the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative, a preconstruction meeting
will be held with the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, to discuss the project in regard to procedure, materials,
inspections, etc.



SECTION 7.0  DRAINAGE.



   A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider
to provide for the proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision
and the drainage area of which it is a part. The following requirements and
methods shall be followed:



   (A)   Storm drainage.  A subdivision plat shall not be considered
for final approval until the subdivider shall submit to the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative, a report by a registered
civil engineer, as to the ability of existing watercourse channels, storm
sewers, culverts, and other improvements pertaining to drainage or flood
control within the subdivision, to handle the additional run-off which would
be generated by the development of the land within the subdivision.
Additional information shall be submitted to adequately indicate that
provision has been made for disposal of surface water without any damage to
the developed or undeveloped land downstream or below the proposed
subdivision. This report shall also include:



      (1)   Estimate of the quantity of storm water entering the
subdivision naturally from areas outside the subdivision.



      (2)   Quantities of flow at each pick-up point (inlet).



      (3)   Location, sizes, and grades of required culverts, storm
drainage sewers, and other required appurtenances.



   (B)   Drainage requirements (grading).



      (1)   No final grading or sidewalk or pavement construction or
installation of utilities shall be permitted in any proposed street until the
final plat has been approved or conditionally approved by the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative.



      (2)   The subdivider shall grade each subdivision in order to
establish street, block, and lot grades in proper relation to each other and
to topography and further, a grading plan shall be prepared for the streets
along with street improvement details. The grading of the roadway shall
extend the full width of the right-of-way. Planting strips shall be graded at
a gradient of not less than 2% upward from the curb to the sidewalk or
property line.



   (C)   Drainage system requirements.



      (1)   The design criteria for storm drainage systems shall be
based on information from the "Manual for Instruction for Drainage Design"
prepared by the Department of Highways, Commonwealth of Kentucky, or any
other acceptable drainage manual.



      (2)   Culverts and storm sewers in all streets shall be
designed for at least a five-year storm frequency.



      (3)   For curbs and gutters, curb and gutter inlets and open
channels an intensity of four inches per hour shall be used in all
computations.



   (D)   Road drainage system.



      (1)   All roadways shall be provided with an adequate storm
drainage system.



      (2)   The road storm sewer system shall serve as the primary
drainage system and shall be designed to carry roadway, adjacent land, and
building storm water drainage. No storm sewer shall be permitted to be run
into the sanitary sewer system within the proposed subdivision.



      (3)   Curb drainage inlets and catch basins shall be provided
at intervals along roadways. Inlet spacing shall be adequate to limit the
spread of water to two feet into the roadway. Storm drainage inlets will be
placed so that crosswalks will not be flooded during the design storm
intensity of four inches per hour.



   (E)   Off-road drainage systems.  The design of the off-road
drainage system shall include the watershed affecting the subdivision and
shall be extended to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm
drainage.



      (1)   When the drainage system is outside of the road
right-of-way, the subdivider shall make provisions for dedicating of an
easement to the city to provide for the future maintenance of said system.



      (2)   The size and location of all off-street watercourses or
ditches running through the subdivision shall be enclosed or left open
subject to the approval of the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative. If a watercourse or ditch is left open it may be required to
be protected by a fence as determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative. The watercourse or ditch easement shall be wide
enough to contain ample clearance for the operation of maintenance equipment.



   (F)   Drainage easement.  Easements for drainage purposes shall be
a minimum of ten feet in width. Where the watercourse is large, easement
widths shall be increased as determined by the Planning Commission, or its
duly authorized representative. Where watercourses cross platted lots
diagonally, the subdivider should straighten such courses where practicable
and should substantially follow sublot lines. Easements shall be shown on the
record plat and shall cover all existing or reconstructed watercourses.



   (G)   Protection of drainage systems.



      (1)   The subdivider shall adequately protect all ditches to
the satisfaction of the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative. Ditches and open channels shall be seeded, sodded, or paved
depending on grades (slopes) and types of soils.



      (2)   As a general rule, ditches and channels with grades up
to 1% shall be seeded, with grades from 1% to 4% shall be sodded, and with
grades over 4% shall be paved. Seeding, sodding and paving operations shall
be in compliance with the "Commonwealth of Kentucky, Department of Highways,
Division of Design, Guidance Manual" issued by the Kentucky Department of
Highways.



   (H)   Material specifications.  Material and construction
specifications for all drainage projects (i.e., pipe, tile, seed, sod) shall
be in compliance with the "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction" issued by the Kentucky Department of Highways.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 7.1 SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.



   The subdivider shall construct a sanitary sewage collection system
designed to serve adequately all lots in his subdivision plus lines adequate
in size to facilitate the orderly development of nearby land which is an
integral part of the neighborhood service or drainage area (See Section 7.12
of these regulations) and connect said collection system to the public
sewerage system.



   (A)   Plans required.  When the subdivider submits the final plat
for approval he shall submit plans and specifications prepared by a
registered civil engineer showing the proposed sanitary sewerage system and
facilities. Said plans shall show pipe sizes, gradients, type of pipe, invert
elevations, location and type of manholes, the location, type, and size of
all lift or pumping stations and such other information as required by the
Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative.



   (B)   Design standards.  The design criteria for the sanitary
sewerage system shall be based on the "Standards for Sewage Works" prepared
by the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Board of Public Health
Engineers and in conformance with the requirements and/or guidelines of the
State Water Pollution Control Commission.



   (C)   Individual on-site disposal systems.  Individual on-site
disposal systems may be permitted in areas zoned to permit development on a
minimum area of one acre with the approval of the Planning Commission, or its
duly authorized representative, and the County Health Department. The County
Health Department shall have the power to require greater than the one-acre
minimum aforementioned.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 7.2 WATER SYSTEM.



   (A)   The subdivider shall construct a complete water distribution
system which shall serve adequately all lots within the proposed subdivision
plus lines adequate in size to facilitate the orderly development of nearby
land which is an integral part of the neighborhood service area (See Section
7.12 of these regulations). The water distribution system shall include
appropriately spaced fire hydrants, valves and other appurtenances necessary.



   (B)   When the subdivider submits the final plat for approval, he
shall submit plans and specifications prepared by a registered professional
civil engineer showing the proposed water system. Said plans shall show line
sizes, type of pipe, location of hydrants and valves, and other
appurtenances, if applicable, supply facilities, booster pumps, elevated or
ground-level storage tanks.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)

(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 7.12 PLANS FOR FUTURE EXPANSION-EXTRA SIZE AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS.



   All improvements shall be installed to satisfy the service requirements
for the service or drainage area in which the subdivision is located and the
improvements shall be of sufficient capacity to handle the expected
development of the overall service or drainage area involved.



   (A)   Extra-size improvements.



      (1)   Where improvements in excess of the size needed to serve
just the proposed subdivision are required, the subdivider shall pay for the
total cost of improvements he is required to install to serve his subdivision
plus the additional costs which result from the extra size improvement
required as determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative.



      (2)   Thus when conditions within the whole drainage area will
require an 18-inch sanitary sewer for example, and a 12-inch sewer will
adequately serve the subdivision involved, the subdivider shall construct the
18-inch utility.



   (B)   Off-site extensions.  When streets or utilities are not
available at the boundary of a proposed subdivision, the Commission, or its
duly authorized representative, shall require, as a prerequisite to approval
of a preliminary and final plat, assurances that such improvement extensions
shall be provided as follows:



      (1)   Extensions of utilities onto the property involved shall
be adequate to serve the total development requirements of the service or
drainage area. Utilities leaving the property shall be constructed in such a
manner as to make their extension practical for servicing the adjacent areas
of the service or drainage area.



      (2)   If the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, finds that the extensions across undeveloped areas would not
be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening properties or as a
governmental expense until some future time, the developer shall be required,
if he wishes to proceed with the development, to obtain necessary easements
or rights-of-way and construct and pay for such extensions. Such improvements
shall be available for connections by subdividers of adjoining land and the
subdivider may contract with adjacent property owners and/or subdividers of
adjacent land for reimbursement of the oversize and/or off-site improvements
constructed.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



SECTION 7.13 PLANS REQUIRED FOR THE CONTROL OF EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION.



   In the event that any developer shall intend to make changes in the
contour of any land proposed to be subdivided, developed, or changed in use
by grading, excavating or the removal or destruction of the natural topsoil,
trees, or other vegetative covering thereon the same shall only be
accomplished after the owner of said land or his agent has submitted to the
Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, for approval a
plan for erosion and sedimentation controls, unless there has been a prior
determination by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, that such plans are not necessary (See Section 3.4 (C)(5)). 
Such plans shall contain adequate measures for control of erosion and
siltation where necessary, using the guidelines and policies contained
herein.  The Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative,
shall review these plans as submitted, and shall take necessary steps to
insure compliance by the developer with these plans as finally approved.



   (A)   Requirements.



      (1)   Three sets of plans for the control of erosion and
sedimentation shall be submitted to the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative, at the time the final plat drawings are submitted.



      (2)   Measures to be taken to control erosion and
sedimentation shall be described and provided for in the construction
agreement and the estimated cost of accomplishing such measures shall be
covered in the performance bond (as per Section 7.19 (B) of these
regulations). In addition, the subdivider shall be required to provide a cash
escrow guarantee (to be held by a company which is in the practice of
handling escrows, approved by the City Council) in an amount determined by
the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, which would
insure the city that emergency measures could be taken by the city at the
subdivider's expense, if he did not initiate corrective action determined to
be needed by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative.
In this regard the subdivider shall, at the time of final plat submission,
deliver to the City Council, written instructions addressed to the escrow
holder which shall authorize and instruct the escrow holder to convey to the
subdivider, after completion of the entire subdivision, (as per the
construction agreement) upon approval, by resolution of the City Council, the
cash guarantee or to convey to the city, when the City Council has approved
such action, by resolution, such amounts of the cash guarantee, as the
resolution requires.



      (3)   During the construction phase, further consultive
technical assistance will be furnished, if necessary, by the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative, or by the local
representative of the Soil Conservation Service. The Planning Commission, or
its duly authorized representative, shall enforce compliance with the
approved plans.



      (4)   The Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, shall make a continuing review and evaluation of the methods
used and the overall effectiveness of the erosion and sedimentation control
program.



   (B)   Suggested control measures.  The following control measures
should be used for an effective erosion and sediment control plan:



      (1)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at
any one time during development.



      (2)   When land is exposed during development, the exposure
should be kept to the shortest practical period of time.



      (3)   Where necessary, temporary vegetation and/or mulching
should be used to protect areas exposed during development.



      (4)   Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins, or
silt traps) should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from
run-off waters from land undergoing development.



      (5)   Provisions should be made to effectively accommodate the
increased run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development.



      (6)   The permanent final vegetation and structures should be
installed as soon as practical in the development.



      (7)   The development plans should be fitted to the topography
and soils so as to create the least erosion potential.



      (8)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained
and protected.

      (1)   Construction agreement.



         (a)   To assure construction and installation of
improvements and control of erosion and sedimentation (when necessary)
required by these regulations, the subdivider shall execute a construction
agreement with the City Council in form and substance approved by the city's
legal counsel. This agreement shall provide that all such improvements (as
specified in this agreement) shall be constructed and installed at the
subdivider's expense in compliance with the standards and specifications for
each of the various types of improvements; (including, when applicable,
measures needed to control erosion and sedimentation); such improvements
shall be available to and for the benefit of the land within such subdivision
and surrounding land which is in the same service or drainage area; that such
improvements (as specified in this agreement) will be completed and installed
within 24 months of the date of conditional or final approval of the final
plat or within a mutually agreed upon extension (but never to exceed 12
consecutive calendar months).



         (b)   The construction agreement shall further provide
that, in the case where approval of the final plat has been given before
construction of improvements and a performance guarantee has been provided;
and if the improvements are not completed within the specified time, the
city, upon proper notice, may complete the improvements and recover full
costs and expenses thereof from the subdivider and may appropriate such
portion of money or bonds posted for the faithful performance of said works.



      (2)   Commencement of improvements.  No construction of any
improvements shall be commenced prior to the approval of the construction
agreement by the City Council.



   (B)   Guarantees.  The subdivider may execute and file guarantees
with the city in lieu of actual installation or completion of the required
improvements when requesting approval of the final plat. Such guarantees may
be in the form of a performance bond filed with the City Council and in such
an amount as the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative,
shall estimate and determine to be reasonably necessary to complete all of
the improvements required to be done by the subdivider (including measures to
control erosion and sedimentation, when applicable) and also the Planning
Commission, or its duly authorized representative's fee, for a field
inspection. The bond may be in the form of a surety bond or a cash bond or
negotiable United States Treasury Certificates of the kind approved by law
for securing deposits of public money. The bond shall be executed by the
subdivider as principal, and if a surety bond, shall be executed by a
corporation authorized to act as a surety under the laws of the State of
Kentucky, as surety. The bond shall be a guarantee of faithful performance of
any and all work and the construction and installation of all improvements
required to be done by the subdivider together with all engineering and
inspection costs and fees incurred by the city. The bond shall contain the
further condition that should the subdivider fail to complete all work and
improvements required to be done by him within 24 consecutive calendar months
of the date of approval of the final plat, or within a mutually agreed upon
extension, but never to exceed 12 consecutive calendar months, that the city
may, at its option, cause all required work to be done and improvements
constructed. The parties executing the bond shall be firmly bound for the
payment of all necessary costs therefor. Whenever the subdivider elects to
deposit cash or approved negotiable United States Treasury Certificates, the
city shall be authorized, in the event of any default on the part of the
subdivider or the performance of any work or construction of any improvements
for which the cash or negotiable bonds has been deposited, to cause the
required work to be done and to withdraw that amount required for payment of
all costs therefor.



   (C)   Liability insurance.  The subdivider may be required to
furnish such insurance as is deemed necessary by the City Council which shall
indemnify and save harmless the city from any and all liability arising by
reason of any conditions which may arise or grow out of the construction or
installation of improvements. The insurance shall be of such an amount as
determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative.
A copy of the insurance policy shall remain at all times with the City
Clerk/Treasurer.

   The work covered by these specifications consists of furnishing all
labor, equipment, and materials and in performing all operations in
connection with the construction of air-entrained portland cement concrete
pavement for streets and alleys in accordance with these specifications and
the applicable drawings.



   The cement concrete pavement work shall consist of a single course of
cement concrete, including reinforcement and longitudinal and transverse
joints, when required, constructed on a prepared subgrade or insulation
course in conformity with the lines, grades, and cross sections shown on the
plans or as established by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative.



ITEM 1.0  GRADING.



   This term shall consist of all grading above or below subgrade
elevations, of whatever nature, required to bring the street to the proper
subgrade elevation, including necessary excavation for curb, gutter,
sidewalk, construction of embankments, excavation and proper sloping of all
cuts, and other work incidental thereto.



   1.1   EXCAVATIONS:  All excavations shall be made to approximate
subgrade elevations and shall be true to grade.  Material below subgrade
elevation in cuts shall not be loosened by plowing or other methods during
the progress of the work.



   1.2   EXCAVATION BELOW SUBGRADE:  Whenever excavation below
subgrade elevation to remove spongy material, vegetable matter, or other
material is ordered by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, the contractor shall remove same in a satisfactory manner
acceptable to the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative,
and shall replace it with satisfactory material in layers not to exceed six
inches in thickness and shall thoroughly compact each layer before the next
layer is placed.



   1.3   CONSTRUCTION OF EMBANKMENTS:  Top soil shall be removed to
eliminate all vegetation from the area upon which embankment is to be
constructed.  Soil so removed may not be used in construction of embankment.



   Embankment shall be constructed, of approved materials, to approximate
subgrade elevation in layers not to exceed six inches in thickness and
extending the full width of the embankment.  Each layer shall be compacted
to not less than 95% of the density determined from the "Test for Moisture-
Density Relationship" (AASHO Designation T-99), unless otherwise directed by
the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, before the
next layer is placed.



   1.4   SUBGRADE PREPARATION:  The subgrade shall be in a moist
condition at the time the concrete is placed.  It shall be thoroughly wetted
a sufficient time in advance of the placing of the concrete to insure that
there will be no puddles or pockets of mud when the concrete is placed.  The
subgrade, however, shall not be allowed to dry out before the concrete is
placed.



   The subgrade soils shall be of uniform material and density to provide
for satisfactory pavement performance.  Soft spots that show up during
construction should be excavated and re-compacted with the same type of
material as found in the adjacent subgrade.  Uni form support cannot be
obtained merely by dumping extra granular material on the soft spot.  With a
uniform subgrade, excessive shrink and swell of expansive soils shall be
prevented by adequate moisture and density controls during compactions.  The
compaction of expansive soil to a density of not less than 95% of the density
determined from the "Test for Moisture-Density Relationship" (AASHO
Designation T-99) will effectively control shrinking and swelling during
periods of dry weather, providing the subgrade is not allowed to dry before
the pavement is constructed.  Concurrent with compaction, the subgrade shall
be shaped to plan elevation, grade, and cross section.  Special care shall
be taken in compacting the backfill of sewers, drainage facilities, and other
permanent structures that may be in the paved area.



   Immediately prior to placing the concrete, the subgrade shall be tested
for conformity with the cross section shown on the plans by means of an
approved template riding on the side forms.  If necessary, material shall be
removed or added, as required, to bring all portions of the subgrade to the
correct elevation.  It shall then be thoroughly compacted and again tested
with the template.  Concrete shall not be placed on any portion of the
subgrade which has not been tested for correct elevation.  The subgrade
should also be cleared of any loose material which may have fallen upon it.



   1.5   EQUIPMENT FOR COMPACTION OF EMBANKMENT AND SUBGRADE:  Any
compaction equipment capable of uniformly producing the required embankment
and subgrade densities, without lamination of, or within, successive layers,
will be permitted by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative.  All compaction equipment shall be in good condition and
shall be operated efficiently to assure uniform compaction.



   1.6   SUBGRADE FOR CURBS, GUTTERS, SIDEWALKS AND DRIVEWAYS: 
Subgrade areas to be occupied by curbs, gutters, sidewalks and driveways
shall be excavated, backfilled, as required, and compacted to establish
grade.  This work shall be done with particular care in accordance with all
requirements herein.



   1.7   EXCESS EXCAVATION:  Excavated material, that is not suitable
for or required for the construction of embankments, or the backfilling of
excavations from which unsuitable material has been removed, shall belong to
and be disposed of by the contractor.  The con tractor shall not deposit
excess material on private property.



   1.8   BORROW MATERIAL:  If sufficient soil of approved quality is
not available on the construction site for replacing unsuitable material
excavated and removed, or for embankment construction, the contractor shall
obtain and supply suitable borrow soil for such construction.



   1.9   SUBBASE:  Subbase may be required for streets that carry
large numbers of heavy trucks.  When subbases are required, they shall be
constructed with same care used in the design and placing of the concrete
pavement.



   1.10   EQUIPMENT OPERATED ON THE STREETS:  The contractor shall be
permitted to operate only pneumatic-tired equipment over any paved street
surfaces and shall be responsible for correction of any damage to street
surfaces in any manner resulting from the contractor's operations.



   1.11   PROTECTION OF UTILITY LINES:  The contractor shall at all
times take proper precautions for the protection of utility lines, the
presence of which are known, or can be determined by the examination of
appropriate maps of the utility companies and the city.  The contractor
shall be financially responsible for the repair of any damage to such service
lines.



   1.12   PROTECTION OF MISCELLANEOUS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
INSTALLATIONS:  The contractor shall at all times take proper precautions
for the protection of and replacement or restoration of driveway culverts,
street intersections, culverts or aprons, mail boxes, driveway approaches,
and all other public and private installations that may be encountered during
construction.  Written approval for complete replacement or restoration work
may be required by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative.

   Forms may be made of wood or metal and shall have a depth equal to or
greater than the prescribed edge thickness of the pavement.  Each section of
form shall be straight, free from bends or warps.



   The method of connections between the form sections shall be such that
the joint thus formed is tight and free from movement in any direction.



   Forms shall be of such cross sections and strength and so secured as to
resist the pressure of the concrete when placed and the impact and vibration
of any equipment which they support without springing or settlement.



   Approved forms shall be used for curved construction where the radius
is 100 feet or less.



   5.1   SETTING FORMS:  The subgrade under the forms shall be
compacted and shaped so that the form when set will be uniformly supported
for its entire length at the specified elevation.  The supply of forms shall
be sufficient to permit their remaining in place for at least 12 hours after
the concrete has been placed.  All forms shall be cleaned and oiled each
time they are used.



   5.2   GRADE AND ALIGNMENT:  The alignment and grade elevation of
the forms shall be checked by the contractor immediately ahead of concrete
placement and necessary corrections will be made.  Any forms that have been
disturbed or subgrade that has become unstable shall be corrected and forms
reset and rechecked.  Any variations in grade and alignment shall be subject
to approval by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, prior to placing the concrete.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



ITEM 6.0  PLACING CONCRETE.



   The concrete shall be mixed in quantities required for immediate use
and shall be deposited on the subgrade to the required depth and width of the
construction land in successive batches and in a continuous operation without
the use of intermediate forms or bulkheads.  The concrete shall be placed as
uniformly as possible in order to minimize the amount of additional spreading
necessary.  While being placed, the concrete shall be vibrated and compacted
with suitable tools so that the formation of voids or honeycomb pockets is
prevented.  The concrete shall be especially well vibrated and tamped
against the forms and along all joints.



   No concrete shall be placed around manholes or other structures until
they have been brought to the required grade and alignment.  Additional
tamping and compaction will be required after raising manholes.



   6.1   COLD WEATHER CONCRETING:  Concrete may be placed when the air
temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat is more than 35°F.
and rising.  Concrete shall not be placed when the air temperature in the
shade and away from artificial heat is less than 40°F. and falling.



   6.2   HOT WEATHER CONCRETING:  Except by written authorization,
concrete placing shall cease if the temperature of the plastic concrete
cannot be maintained at 90°F. or lower.



   To facilitate the placement of concrete in hot weather, a retarding
chemical admixture Type B or D in conformance with ASTM C-494 may be used.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



ITEM 7.0  CONSOLIDATING AND FINISHING.



   The pavement shall be struck off and consolidated with a mechanical
finishing machine or by hand-finishing methods.  When a mechanical finishing
machine is used, the concrete shall be struck off at such a height that after
consolidation and final finishing, it shall be at the elevation as shown on
the plans.



   The finishing machine shall be provided with a screed which will
consolidate the concrete by pressure, vibration or both.  The concrete shall
be brought to a true and even surface, free from rock pockets.  The edge of
the screeds along the curb line may be notched out to allow for sufficient
concrete to form the integral curb.  Hand-finishing tools shall be kept
available for use in case the finishing machine breaks down.



   When hand-finishing is used, the pavement shall be struck off and
consolidated by a vibrating screed to the elevation as shown on the plans. 
When the forward motion of the vibrating screed is stopped, the vibrator
shall be shut off; it shall not be allowed to idle on the concrete.



   7.1   SCRAPING AND STRAIGHTEDGING: The pavement shall be scraped
with a straightedge equipped with handles to permit it to be operated from
the edge of the pavement.



   When irregularities are discovered, they shall be corrected by adding
or removing concrete.  All disturbed places shall be floated with a wooden
or metal float not less than three feet long and not less than six inches
wide and again straightedged.



   7.2   EDGING:  Before final finishing is completed and before the
concrete has taken its initial set, the edges of the slab and curb shall be
carefully finished with an edger, having a radius of 1/8 inch.



   7.3   FINAL SURFACE FINISH:  A burlap drag shall be used as the
final finishing method for concrete pavement.  The drag shall be at least
three feet in width and long enough to cover the entire pavement width.  It
shall be laid on the surface of the pavement and dragged forward in the
direction in which the pavement is being laid.  The curb shall have the same
final finish as the pavement.



   The final surface of the concrete pavement and curb shall have a
uniform gritty texture, free from excessive harshness and true to the grades
and cross sections shown on the plans.  The Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative, may require changes in the final finishing
procedure as required to produce the desired final surface texture.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



ITEM 8.0  INTEGRAL CURB.



   When integral vertical curbs are required along the edges of all street
pavement, depressed curbs shall be provided at all driveway entrances and at
such other locations as designated by the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative.



   The integral curb shall be constructed with or immediately following
the finished operation.  Special care shall be taken so that the curb
construction does not lag the pavement construction and form a "cold joint".



   In placing curb concrete, sufficient spading shall be done to secure
adequate bond with paving a slab and eliminate all voids in the curb.



   Curbs shall be formed to the cross section as shown on the drawings.



(Ord. 1971-2, passed 4-6-71)



ITEM 9.0  CURING.



   Concrete shall be cured by protecting it against loss of moisture,
rapid temperature change, from rain, flowing water and mechanical injury for
a period of not less than five days from the beginning of the curing
operation.  Moist curing, waterproof paper, white pigmented liquid membrane
compound or a combination thereof may be used for curing.  Immediately after
finishing operations have been completed, the entire surface of the newly
laid concrete shall be covered by the curing medium which is applicable to
local conditions and approved by the Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representative.



   The edge of concrete slabs exposed by the removal of forms shall be
protected immediately to provide these surfaces with continuous curing
treatment equal to the method selected for curing a slab surface and to
prevent injury to concrete edges.



   The covering material shall be kept free of any substances which may be
detrimental to the surface of the concrete.  The initial curing medium shall
be effective and shall be applied so as to prevent checking, cracking and the
appearance of dry spots in the surface of the concrete.  The contractor
shall have the equipment needed for adequate curing at hand and ready to
install before actual concrete placement begins.  In all cases in which the
curing medium requires the use of water, the curing shall have prior right to
all water supply.  Failure to provide sufficient cover material of the type
selected, failure to maintain saturation for the entire curing period in the
moist-curing methods, lack of water to adequately care for both curing and
other requirements or other failures to comply with curing requirements shall
be cause for immediate suspension of concreting operations.



   9.1   MOIST CURING:  Moist curing shall be accomplished by covering
of burlap, cotton mats, or other approved fabric mat used singly or in
combination.



   Curing mats shall be thoroughly wet when applied and kept continuously
wet and in intimate contact with the pavement surface for the duration of the
moist curing period.  Other fabric mats shall conform in design and shall
provide a curing medium at least equal to cotton mats.  Cotton mats, other
fabric mats, burlap mats, and burlap strips shall be furnished in the widths
or lengths, after shrinkage, required to cover the entire width and edges of
the pavement lane.  Mats or burlap shall be lapped at joints between
adjacent sheets to prevent drying of this location.  Moist curing, when used
as initial curing, shall be continued for not less than 24 hours.  Type and
weight of cotton mats for curing concrete shall conform to ASTM C-440 or
AASHO M-73.  Burlap strips shall conform to AASHO M-182.



   9.2   WATERPROOF PAPER AND POLYETHYLENE SHEETING CURING:  The
surface of the concrete shall be wetted with a fine spray of water and then
covered with the waterproof paper or sheeting.  The paper or sheeting shall
be in pieces large enough to cover the entire width and edges of the slab and
shall be lapped not less than 12 inches.  Paper or sheeting shall be
adequately weighted to prevent displacement or billowing due to wind.  Paper
or sheeting folded down over the side of the pavement widths shall be secured
by a continuous bank of earth.  Tears or holes appearing in the paper or
sheeting during the curing period shall be immediately repaired.



   9.3   LIQUID MEMBRANE CURING COMPOUND:  Pigmented liquid membrane
during compound shall meet the specifications under ASTM C-309.  The curing
compound must be applied to cover the surface completely and uniformly at a
rate which will achieve the performance requirement specified in AASHO
specifications M-148 or ASTM Designation C-309.  This method of curing shall
be applied immediately behind the final finishing operation or after the
initial curing when a combination of methods are used.  Failure to provide
complete and uniform coverage at the required rate will be cause for
discontinuance of this method of curing and the substitution of one of the
other approved methods.  The compound shall be kept agitated to prevent the
pigment from settling.  Special care shall be taken to apply the curing
compound to the pavement edges immediately after the forms have been removed.

ITEM 4.0  DESIGN OF ASPHALT PAVEMENT STRUCTURE.



   4.1   DESCRIPTION:  Asphalt pavement structures for subdivision
streets shall be designed in conformance with the requirements of this
specification.  Thickness of the total pavement, and of component layers,
shall be determined on the basis of street classification, subgrade support,
and relative strength of component materials in compliance with the
procedures hereinafter set forth.  Two design procedures are provided and
either may be used.  The first provides minimum thickness standards for each
street classification and soil classification.  The second provides for
adjustment of pavement design thickness for each street classification to
reflect the measured subgrade strength.



   4.2   STREET CLASSIFICATION:  Subdivision streets are classified
into three groups - local, collector, and arterials.  These street
classifications are defined in Article II of these regulations.



   4.3   SUBGRADE SUPPORT:  Soil support shall be determined from one
of the following procedures:



      4.3.1   CALIFORNIA BEARING RATIO:  Representative samples of
soil, or soils, to be used in construction of the subgrade, or from prepared
subgrade, shall be tested in accord with the current requirements of the
Kentucky Department of Highways Test Procedure for California Bearing Ratio
(CBR) except that the CBR-value at 0.1 inch penetration shall be used.



      4.3.2   SOIL CLASSIFICATION:  Soil to be used, or that has
been used, for subgrade construction shall be sampled and classified in
accordance with AASHO Designation M-147.  Soil ratings to express their
relative effectiveness as subgrade for design purposes are designated as soil
groups A, B, or C in terms of the referred to street classification system. 
Where prior testing has established typical classification for frequently
encountered soils, the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized
representative, may approve designation of a soil group without additional
tests.  Soil groups are defined as follows:



         Soil Group A - Granular soils that drain well; sand,
gravel, or combinations of sand and gravel.  This soil group includes AASHO
Soil Classifications A-la, A-1-b, A-2-4, A-2-5, and A-3.



         Soil Group B - Soils, including silty-clay, sandy-clay and
sands or gravels containing considerable silt and clay, which retain
considerable strength when wet.  This soil group includes AASHO Soil
Classifications A-2-6, A-4, and some A-6 soils.  A-6 soils included are
those having a group index of ten or less.



         Soil Group C - Heavy clay soils, that lose most of their
strength when wet, and highly resilient silts.  This soil group includes
AASHO Soil Classifications A-5 and A-6 soils having a group index greater
than ten, A-7 and A-2-7.



   4.4   PAVEMENT THICKNESS REQUIREMENTS:  Thickness of component
layers of the pavement for streets and driveways and of the total pavement
structure shall be determined by one of the following methods:



      4.4.1   Method A:  Method A shall apply when subgrade
strength tests (CBR) are not available.  Design thickness of both the total
pavement and its components shall be determined from Table 6 for the
appropriate soil classification and street classification.



      4.4.2   Method B:  Method B shall apply when subgrade soil
has been tested to determine its representative California Bearing Ratio
(CBR).  Required design thickness for the appropriate street classification
shall be determined from Figure 4 for asphalt pavement thickness.  Thickness
determined from this Figure, for any street classification and CBR-value,
will be in inches of asphalt concrete surface and base and the design
thickness.



   Base types, herein specified, other than asphalt concrete base type I
or type II may be used.  These other base types are asphalt base type III or
type IV, granular base and/or subbase as herein specified.  When bases other
than asphalt concrete are used, the minimum thickness of asphalt concrete
surface course, type I or type II for the base type selected, as specified in
Table 6, shall be used.

§ 156.01  DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND PUBLIC POLICY.



   City Council finds as follows:



   (A)   That buildings and neighborhoods having historic,
architectural or cultural interest and value have been neglected, altered or
destroyed notwithstanding the feasibility and desirability of preserving and
continuing the use of such buildings and neighborhoods and without adequate
consideration of the irreplaceable loss to the public.



   (B)   That the historic character of Dayton is of vital importance
in maintaining the economy of the city and that its historic buildings and
neighborhoods can be preserved, improved and used by means of appropriate
changes.



   (C)   That Dayton has we11-established residential and business
districts and that the history of the city is shown today through buildings
representing the activities and events during its growth. And that the city
has buildings and areas that represent the persons who live and work or have
lived and worked in Dayton during a period of more than one hundred (100)
years. And that the distinctive and significant character of this city can
only be maintained by protecting and enhancing its historic, architectural
and cultural heritage and by preventing unnecessary injury or destruction of
its landmarks and historic districts which are civic and community assets.



   (D)   That the federal and Kentucky governments have passed laws to
protect and preserve landmarks and historic districts, that some of these
laws provide incentives for historic preservation, and that the National
Historic Preservation Act permits the establishment of a certified local
government program creating a new federal-state-local partnership to
encourage the efforts by cities to protect and preserve their landmarks and
historic districts.



   (E)   That individual historic preservation projects have already
been undertaken in Dayton and that this chapter will encourage additional
preservation work that will be important in achieving the goals of the city.



   (F)   That this chapter benefits all the residents of Dayton and all
the owners of property.



   (G)   That it is a matter of public policy that the preservation,
protection and use of landmarks and historic districts is a public necessity
because they have a special character or a special historic, architectural or
cultural interest and value and thus serve as visible reminders of the
history and heritage of this city, state and nation. Further it is a matter
of public policy that this chapter is required in the interest of the health,
prosperity, safety, welfare and economic well-being of the people.



   (H)   That the purpose of this chapter is to effect the goals as set
forth in the above findings and declarations of public policy and
specifically, but not exclusively, to:



      (1)   Accomplish the preservation, protection and use of
historic landmarks, landmark sites and districts having a special character
or special historic, architectural or cultural interest and value to this
city, state and nation;



      (2)   Promote the educational, cultural, economic and general
welfare of the people and safeguard the city’s history and heritage as
reflected in such landmarks, sites and districts;



      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values in such districts
and in the city as a whole;



      (4)   Foster civic pride in the value of notable
accomplishments of the past;



      (5)   Strengthen the economy of the city;



      (6)   Protect and enhance the city’s attraction to
residents, tourists and visitors and serve as a support and stimulus to
business; and



      (7)   Enhance the visual and aesthetic character, diversity
and interest of the city.

§ 156.05  NOMINATIONS TO NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES.



   (A)   To participate in the certified local government program, the
city shall initiate all local nominations to the National Register of
Historic Places and shall request the Mayor and the Board to submit
recommendations on each proposed nomination to the National Register. The
Mayor and the Board shall obtain comments from the public that shall be
included in their National Register recommendations. Within sixty (60) days
of the receipt of a nomination from a private individual or the initiation of
a nomination by the city, the city shall inform the Kentucky Heritage Council
and the owner of the property of the two (2) recommendations regarding the
eligibility of the property. If the Mayor and the Board do not agree, both
opinions shall be forwarded in the city’s report. If both the Mayor and the
Board recommend that a property not be nominated, the Kentucky Heritage
Council shall inform the property owner, the Kentucky Historic Preservation
Review Board and the State Historic Preservation Officer, and the property
will not be nominated unless an appeal is filed with the State Historic
Preservation Officer.



   (B)   If the Mayor and the Board agree that a property should be
nominated or if either of them feels that a property should be nominated, the
nomination will receive preliminary review by the Kentucky Historic
Preservation Review Board. The Review Board shall make a recommendation to
the State Historic Preservation Officer who decides whether to forward the
nomination to the U.S. Secretary of the Interior who shall make the decision

property owner may appeal the final decision by the State Historic
Preservation Officer.



(Ord. 2007-4, passed 2-6-07)



§ 156.06  DESIGNATION OF LANDMARK AND LANDMARK SITES AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS.



   (A)   The City Council may request the Board to study a building or
an area in order to make a recommendation on whether it qualifies for
designation as a landmark, a landmark site or historic district. The owner of
a property may request the Board to study his or her building in order to
make a recommendation on whether it qualifies for designation as a landmark
or landmark site. Each designation of a landmark shall include the
designation of a landmark site.



   (B)   The Board shall assemble information about a property or
district being considered for designation and shall schedule a public hearing
on the proposed designation. Prior to the hearing the Chair or another member
of the Board may have an individual meeting with an owner or a tenant of a
building under construction for designation as a landmark or as a part of a
historic district. The purpose of these meetings shall be to explain the
provisions of this chapter and to answer questions about how a designation
would affect the owner or tenant.  Prior to the hearing, the Board may hold
an educational meeting in an area or a neighborhood under consideration in
order to explain the provisions of this chapter and to answer questions.



   (C)   Advertised notice of the public hearing pursuant to KRS
Chapter 424 shall be given, including conspicuous posting on the property or
in the proposed district for fourteen (14) consecutive days immediately prior
to the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be given at least fourteen (14)
days in advance of the hearing by certified letters to the owners of property
under consideration and the owners of all adjoining property. Written notice
shall be considered sufficient when it is mailed to the owner at the address
listed in the records maintained by the Property Valuation Administrator.



   (D)   Before its first public hearing on a designation, the Board
shall recommend to City Council and gain approval for general guidelines that
will apply to Dayton’s landmarks and historic districts and will assist
owners in the preservation and rehabilitation of their property. The general
guidelines may include the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and may
include other guidelines that will apply to all designated property in the
city. In its guidelines and in its decisions the Board shall not limit new
construction to any one architectural style but shall seek to preserve the
character and integrity of the landmark or the historic district. The Board
may expand or amend the guidelines provided it holds a public hearing on the
changes and submits the proposed changes to the City Council for approval.



   (E)   A landmark or historic district shall qualify for designation
when it meets one (1) or more of the following criteria which shall be
discussed in a Board report making its recommendations to the City Council:



      (1)   Its value as a reminder of the cultural or
archaeological heritage of the city, state or nation;



      (2)   Its location as a site of a significant city, local,
state or national event;



      (3)   Its identification with a person or persons who
significantly contributed to the development of the city, state or nation;



      (4)   Its identification as the work of a master builder,
designer, or architect whose individual work has influenced the development
of the city, state or nation;



      (5)   Its value as a building that is recognized for the
quality of its architecture and that retains sufficient elements showing its
architectural significance:



      (6)   Its distinguishing characteristics of an architectural
style valuable for the study of a period, method of construction, or use of
indigenous materials;



      (7)   Its character as a geographically definable area
possessing a significant concentration of buildings or structures united by
past events or by its plan or physical development; or



      (8)   Its character as an established and geographically
definable residential neighborhood or business district, united by culture,
architectural style or physical plan and development.



   (F)   After evaluating the testimony at its public hearing, survey
information and other material it has assembled, the Board shall make its
recommendation to the City Council with a written report on the property or
area under consideration. In its report the Board may set goals for a
proposed historic district in order to encourage appropriate work in the
district.



   (G)   The city’s Planning and Zoning Commission shall report on
the relationship between the proposed designation and existing and future
plans for the development of the city. If the Planning and Zoning Commission
approves of the proposed designation, it shall amend the Comprehensive Plan
to include the proposed designation and shall recommend a change in the
zoning map to show the proposed historic designation. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall forward its comments, the Comprehensive Plan amendment and
the zoning map change to the City Council. If the Planning and Zoning
Commission does not approve of the proposed designation, it shall forward its
comments to the City Council.



   (H)   The City Council shall approve, modify or disapprove the
proposed designation after receiving the recommendation of the Board and the
material from the Planning and Zoning Board. If the City Council decides to
make a designation and no Comprehensive Plan amendment has been adopted and
no zoning map change has been recommended, the City Council shall request the
Planning and Zoning Commission to reconsider its earlier decision, and shall
provide that the designation shall take effect after these preliminary steps
have been approved.



   (I)   The Board shall notify each owner of the decision relating to
his or her property and shall arrange that the designation of a property as a
landmark or as a part of a historic district be recorded in the land records
of the county. The Board shall also give notice of the decision to the
government offices in the city and county which shall retain them for future
reference.



   (J)   The amendment or rescission of any designation shall be
accomplished through the same steps as were followed in the original
designation.

§ 156.07  APPROVAL OF CHANGES TO LANDMARKS, LANDMARK SITES, AND PROPERTY IN
HISTORIC DISTRICTS.



   (A)   (1)   A certificate of appropriateness from the Board shall
be required before a person may undertake the following actions affecting a
landmark, a landmark site, or a property in a historic district:



         (a)   Alteration of the exterior part of a structure
that is visible to the public;



         (b)   New construction;



         (c)   Demolition; or



         (d)   Relocation.



      (2)   When seeking a building permit involving designated
property, the person must submit a certificate of appropriateness approving
the work listed in this division (A).



   (B)   When a person wishes to undertake an exterior alteration
visible to the public affecting a landmark, a landmark site or a property in
a historic district or when a person wishes to undertake new construction, a
demolition or a relocation affecting a landmark, landmark site or a property
in a historic district, that person shall apply to the Board for a
certificate of appropriateness. This application is required even when the
proposed work does not require a building permit. The applicant shall
provide, where applicable, drawings of the proposed work, photographs of the
existing building, structure or site and adjacent properties, and information
about the building materials to be used. Further, the applicant shall pay
such application fee as may be assessed by the city for costs of advertising
and other costs of administration.



   (C)   In the event work is being performed without the required
certificate of appropriateness, the city shall issue a stop work order. All
work shall cease on the designated property. No additional work shall be
undertaken as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect. The
Board shall meet with the owner or tenant to resolve the problem. The city
may apply in Circuit Court for an injunction to enforce its stop work order.



   (D)   The Board shall hold a public hearing on each certificate of
appropriateness within thirty (30) days after a completed application is
received by the Board. The Board shall make a decision on the application
within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of a completed application
provided that the Board may extend the time for decision an additional sixty
(60) days when the application is for a demolition or new construction. The
Board shall approve or disapprove each application, and it shall give its
reasons for its decision using the criteria contained in this section and in
its guidelines. The Board may suggest modifications to an application and may
then approve a certificate of appropriateness providing for revisions in the
plans submitted. If the Board fails to decide on an application within the
specified time period, the application shall be deemed approved. Applicants
and all abutting property owners shall be given notice of the public hearings
and meetings relating to their application and shall be informed of the
Board’s decision all by certified mail addressed to the owner at the
address listed in the records maintained by the Property Valuation
Administrator. Advertised notice shall be given as required by KRS Chapter
424. When an application has been approved, the applicant shall be given a
certificate of appropriateness. Advertised notice of the public hearing shall
be given, including conspicuous posting on the property.



   (E)   In making a decision on an application, the Board shall use
its guidelines. The Board shall consider: (1) the effect of the proposed work
on the landmark, the landmark site, or the property in the historic district
upon which such work is to be done; and (2) the relationship between such
work and other buildings and structures on the landmark site or other
property in the historic district. In evaluating the effect and the
relationship, the Board shall consider historical and architectural
significance, architectural style, design, texture, materials and color. The
certificate from the Board shall not relieve the property owner from
complying with the requirements of other state and local laws and regulations.



   (F)   In making a decision on an application, the Board shall be
aware of the importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the
applicant. The Board shall also recognize the importance of approving plans
that will be reasonable for the applicant to carry out. Before an applicant
prepares his or her plans, he or she may bring a tentative proposal to the
Board for its comments. The Board shall prepare a list of routine alterations
that shall receive immediate approval without a public hearing when an
applicant complies with the specifications of the Board. The list shall
include paint colors appropriate for different types of buildings.



   (G)   Owners and tenants shall apply to the Board for a certificate
of appropriateness for a sign before their sign is made. In addition to its
guidelines, the Board shall prepare and distribute examples, of signs that
would be appropriate in a historic district. The Board’s standards for
signs shall be the standards used in a historic district but, also, shall not
conflict with the provisions of other local laws and regulations.



   (H)   When an applicant wishes to demolish a landmark, a building or
structure on a landmark site or a building or structure in a historic
district, the Board shall negotiate with the applicant to see if an
alternative to demolition can be found. The Board may ask interested
individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to
demolition and in obtaining estimates on rehabilitation costs for the
threatened building. After its public hearing, the Board may decide that a
building or structure in a historic district or on a landmark site may be
demolished because it does not contribute to the historic district or to the
landmark. On all other demolition applications, the Board shall study the
question of economic hardship for the applicant and shall determine whether
the landmark or the property in the historic district can be put to
reasonable beneficial use without the approval of the demolition application.
In the case of an income-producing building, the Board shall also determine
whether the applicant can obtain a reasonable return from his or her
building. The Board may ask applicants for additional information to be used
in making these determinations. If economic hardship or the lack of a
reasonable return is not proved, the Board shall deny the demolition
application unless the Board finds grounds to grant the demolition
application under the points contained in § 156.07(E).



   (I)   (1)   When an applicant wishes to have a landmark, a
building or structure on a landmark site, or a building or structure in a
historic district moved or when an applicant wishes to move a building or
structure to a landmark site or to a property in a historic district, the
Board shall consider:



         (a)   The contribution the building or structure makes
to its present setting;



         (b)   Whether there are definite plans for the site to
be vacated;



         (c)   Whether the building or structure can be moved
without significant damage to its physical integrity; and



         (d)   The compatibility of the building or structure to
its proposed site and adjacent properties.



      (2)   These considerations shall be in addition to the points
contained in § 156.07(E).



   (J)   Within thirty (30) days, the applicant shall have an appeal to
the Circuit Court from a decision of the Board on an application for a
certificate of appropriateness.



(Ord. 2007-4, passed 2-6-07) Penalty, see § 38.15



§ 156.08  CONFORMITY WITH CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.



   All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall
conform to the provisions of such certificate. It shall be the responsibility
of the building inspector and the Board to inspect from time to time any work
being performed to assure such compliance. In the event work is being
performed which is not in accordance with such certificate, the city shall
issue a stop work order. All work shall cease on the designated property. No
additional work shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order shall
continue in effect. The Board shall meet with the owner or tenant to resolve
the problem. The city may apply in Circuit Court for an injunction to enforce
its stop work order.

§ 156.09  MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF LANDMARKS, LANDMARK SITES AND PROPERTY
IN HISTORIC DISTRICTS.



   (A)   (1)   Every person in charge of a landmark, a landmark site
or a property in a historic district shall keep in good repair:



         (a)   All of the exterior portions of such buildings or
structures; and



         (b)   All interior portions thereof which, if not so
maintained, may cause such buildings or structures to deteriorate or to
become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair.



      (2)   The purpose of this section is to prevent a person from
forcing the demolition of his or her building by neglecting it and by
permitting damage to the building because of weather or vandalism. No
provision in this chapter shall be interpreted to require an owner or tenant
to undertake an alteration or to restore his or her building to its original
appearance.



   (B)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness provided this work on a landmark, a landmark
site or property in a historic district does not change its exterior
appearance that is visible to the public.



   (C)   An owner shall immediately notify the city of emergency
conditions dangerous to life, health or property affecting a landmark, a
landmark site, or a property in a historic district, and the owner shall
immediately start and complete the work required to make his or her property
safe. In any case where the city determines that there are emergency
conditions dangerous to life, health or property affecting a landmark, a
landmark site or a property in a historic district, the city shall order the
remedying of these conditions without the approval of the Board. The city
shall promptly notify the Chairman of the Board of the action being taken.



   (D)   The Board shall request a meeting with a property owner when
his or her landmark or his or her building in a historic district is in poor
repair, and the Board shall discuss with the owner ways to improve the
condition of his or her property.



   (E)   The provisions of this section are in addition to all other
provisions of all city, local or state codes applicable to building and
property maintenance.

the property is uninhabited. Such conditions may include, but are not limited
to, overgrown or dead vegetation; accumulation of flyers, mail or trash;
rodent infestation; disconnected utilities; the absence of window coverings
or furniture; broken and/or boarded up windows and entryways; neglect or lack
of general maintenance; and, statements of neighbors, delivery persons or
government employees as to the lack of occupancy. The abandonment or
voluntary “walk away” by the owner of any property in which any creditor
holds a mortgage interest shall be considered as evidence of vacancy.

owners of vacant property subject to the requirements of this chapter must
complete and submit as specified herein.
