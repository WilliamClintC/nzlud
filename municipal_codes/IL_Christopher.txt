(Ord. 4. Passed 11-4-29.)



220.12  ELECTRONIC ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS.



   (a)   Rules Statement.  It is the decision of the City that any
member of the City Council may attend any open or closed meeting of the City
Council via electronic means (such as by telephone, video or internet
connection) provided that such attendance is in compliance with these rules
and any applicable laws.



   (b)   Prerequisites. A member of the City Council may attend a
meeting electronically if the member meets the following conditions: A quorum
is physically present throughout the meeting; and, a majority of the members
present of the City Council votes to approve the electronic attendance at the
meeting.



      (1)   The member should notify the Clerk at least three days
before the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications
equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical
arrangements will result in denial of a request for electronic attendance.



      (2)   The member must assert one of the following three
reasons why he or she is unable to physically attend the meeting:



         A.   The member cannot attend because of personal
illness or disability;



         B.   The member cannot attend because of employment
purposes or the business of the City; or



         C.   The member cannot attend because of a family or
other emergency.



      (3)   The Clerk, after receiving the electronic attendance
request, shall inform the City Council of the request for electronic
attendance.



   (c)   Voting Procedures. After a roll call establishing that a
quorum is physically present, the presiding officer shall call for a motion
that a member may be permitted to attend the meeting electronically after
specifying the reason entitling the absent member to attend electronically.
The motion must be approved by a vote of a majority of the members present of
the City Council.



   (d)   Adequate Equipment Required. The member participating
electronically and other members of the City Council must be able to
communicate effectively, and members of the audience must be able to hear all
communications at the meeting site. Before allowing electronic attendance at
any meeting, the City Council shall provide equipment adequate to accomplish
this objective at the meeting site.



   (e)   Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be
considered an off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for
that meeting. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state specifically
whether each member is physically present or present by electronic means.



   (f)   Rights of Remote Member. A member permitted to attend
electronically will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting
and participate in the same capacity as those members physically present,
subject to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted
and adhered to. The member attending electronically shall be heard,
considered, and counted as to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any
member attending electronically shall be called during any vote taken, and
his or her vote counted and recorded by the Clerk and placed in the minutes
for the corresponding meeting. A member attending electronically may leave a
meeting and return as in the case of any member, provided the member
attending electronically shall announce his or her leaving and returning.

(Ord. 808. Passed 6-14-04.)



256.32  POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.



   (a)   Prohibition on Sexual Harassment.  It is unlawful to harass a
person because of that person’s sex.  The courts have determined that
sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S.
Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991.  All persons have a right to
work in an environment free from sexual harassment.  Sexual harassment is
unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations.  It is a policy of the City to prohibit harassment of any
person by any Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal employee or
Municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender.  All Municipal
officials, Municipal agents, Municipal employees and Municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.



   (b)   Definition of Sexual Harassment.  This policy adopts the
definition of sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act,
which currently defines sexual harassment as:



      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual
favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when:



         A.   Submission to such conduct is made either
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;



         B.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an
individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such
individual; or



         C.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of
substantially interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating
an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.



      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:



         A.   Verbal:  sexual innuendos, suggestive comments,
insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits,
sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements
about other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.



         B.   Non-verbal:  suggestive or insulting sounds
(whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures,
“catcalls”, “smacking” or “kissing” noises.



         C.   Visual:  posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a
sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or websites.



         D.   Physical:  touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.



         E.   Textual/electronic:  “sexting” (electronically
sending messages with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use
of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all
forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages,
internet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and social network
websites like Facebook and Twitter).



      (3)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are
easier to determine.  On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual
harassment is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual
perception and interpretation.  The courts will assess sexual harassment by
a standard of what would offend a “reasonable person.”



   (c)   Procedure for Reporting an Allegation of Sexual Harassment.



      (1)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or
believes herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal
with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly
communicating her/his position to the offending employee, and her/his
immediate supervisor.  It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be
directed at the person making the report.



      (2)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be
sexual harassment, including the following:



         A.   Electronic/direct communication.  If there is
sexual harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should
directly and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome
and request that the offending behavior stop.  The initial message may be
verbal.  If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing in
a note or a memo.



         B.   Contact with supervisory personnel.



            1.   At the same time direct communication is
undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by
the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the immediate
supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a director of
human resources, an ethics officer, the City manager or administrator, or the
chief executive officer of the Municipality.



            2.   The employee experiencing what he or she
believes to be sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware
of the conduct.  If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a
supervisor or other responsible officer, the Municipality will not be
presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.



         C.   Resolution outside Municipality.  The purpose of
this policy is to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for
responding to every report and incident so that problems can be identified
and remedied by the Municipality.  However, all Municipal employees have the
right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a
formal complaint with those entities.  An IDHR complaint must be filed
within 180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing
offense.  A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within 300 days.



      (3)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any
report (what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including,
but not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and
telephone messages.



      (4)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be
accepted and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention
of the Municipality.  However, because of the serious implications of sexual
harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation
and the questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing
cooperation is a vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate
outcome.



   (d)   Prohibition on Retaliation for Reporting Sexual Harassment
Allegations.



      (1)   No Municipal official, Municipal agency, Municipal
employee or Municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action
against any Municipal employee due to a Municipal employee’s:



         A.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any
violation of this policy;



         B.   The provision of information related to or
testimony before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or
inquiry into any violation of this policy; or



         C.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to
enforce the provisions of this policy.



      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action
means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or
transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any Municipal
employee that is taken in retaliation for a Municipal employee’s
involvement in protected activity pursuant to this policy.



      (3)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against
even if a report made in good faith is not substantiated.  In addition, any
witness will be protected from retaliation.



      (4)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained
herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10)
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that
occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:



         A.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor
or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member,
State agency, or other State employee that the State employee reasonably
believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation;



         B.   Provides information to or testifies before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any
violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency
or other State employee; or



         C.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce
the provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.



      (5)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)),
an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information
in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or
committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable
cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a State or
Federal law, rule, or regulation.  In addition, an employer may not
retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or
law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe
that the information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule,
or regulation.  (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).



      (6)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS
5/6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more
people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed
that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual
harassment in employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a
complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation,
proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.



      (7)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower
paying job or passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR
or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge, due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300
days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation.



   (e)   Consequences of a Violation of the Prohibition on Sexual
Harassment.  In addition to any and all other discipline that may be
applicable pursuant to Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures,
employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who
violates this policy or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5
ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense,
applicable discipline or discharge by the Municipality and any applicable
fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State law or
Federal law.  Each violation may constitute a separate offense.  Any
discipline imposed by the Municipality shall be separate and distinct from
any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties
imposed by a court of law or a State or Federal agency.



   (f)   Consequences for Knowingly Making a False Report.



      (1)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by
an accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other
than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual
harassment.  A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot
be proven.  Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a
false or frivolous report is a severe offense that can itself result in
disciplinary action.  Any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall be subject to
discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable Municipal policies, employment
agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining
agreements.



      (2)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false
report alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and
Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State
Police, a State’s Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law
enforcement official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.  An ethics
commission may levy an administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person
who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

have such dog inoculated by a duly licensed veterinarian, as he or she elects
and the poundkeeper shall forthwith cause the dog to be duly inoculated
against rabies.  No dog shall be released without being inoculated for the

Department of Agriculture.  Upon the payment of the required charges, the
dog shall thereupon be released to the owner or keeper.

fourteen days.  If, during that period, such dog develops symptoms of
illness, a veterinarian shall be called to diagnose its condition.  If the
symptoms disclosed are such as to indicate the presence of rabies, such dog
shall be destroyed, in such a manner, however, as to preserve intact the
head, which shall thereupon be detached and immediately sent to the
diagnostic laboratory of the Department of Agriculture.  If such dog cannot
be safely taken up and impounded, it may be shot, with care being taken to
preserve the head intact which shall thereupon be immediately detached and
delivered to the diagnostic laboratory of the Department of Agriculture.



      If, at the expiration of the period of fourteen days, no symptoms
of rabies have developed in such dog so impounded, the same may be redeemed
by the owner upon payment of the redemption fees and charges specified in

person, such dog shall be humanely destroyed by the poundkeeper. After having
been notified that his or her dog has bitten or otherwise injured a person,
the owner or keeper thereof shall not under any circumstances permit such dog
to be at large unless it is securely muzzled.

856.01  BLOCK DEFINED.



   "Block," as used in this chapter, means any quarter-quarter-quarter
(one sixty-fourth) of a section of land or any part thereof within the City
(for example, the SWj of the NWj of the SWj of Section 25-6-1), as shown by
the original and official statutory government survey of lands in the State,
whether platted or not.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.02  PURPOSE.



   It is hereby declared that the business of drilling for, obtaining,
producing and marketing oil and gas, within the City, is a hazardous and
dangerous occupation and business and that it is necessary, in the public
interest and for the protection of the health and safety of the inhabitants
of the City and for the prevention of danger from fires, explosions and
dangerous conditions and for the prevention of the creation and maintenance
of public nuisances, that such business and occupation be regulated and
controlled within the City.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.03  PERMIT REQUIRED.



   No person shall drill or commence drilling or operate a well for oil or
gas, or lay or commence to lay, install, maintain or operate a pipeline, or
make an excavation, in any street, alley, highway, parking space, sidewalk
area or other public property, or erect, use or maintain a tank for the
storing or transportation of oil, gas or water within the City, without first
obtaining a permit to do so. Each such well, pipeline or tank shall require a
separate permit.  However, no such permit shall be required to cross an
alley within the block where a permittee is drilling or operating such a well.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.04  NUMBER OF PERMITS.



   Only four permits shall be granted to drill on a single block, except
in cases where it appears that an additional well is necessary to properly
protect real estate situated in any block against improper and unfair
drainage from a well which is located on adjoining real estate, in which
event Council may permit the drilling of such additional well on such
adjoining real estate. (Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.05  PERMIT APPLICATIONS.



   Before a permit for the drilling, putting down and/or operation of an
oil or gas well is issued, a written application therefor, signed by the
applicant or some duly authorized person in the applicant's behalf, shall be
filed with the City Clerk.  Such application shall accurately describe the
block and the exact lot and location thereof where the proposed well is to be
drilled and there shall be attached thereto either certified or photostatic
copies of all deeds, leases or contracts with the owner of the property in
such block which is owned or controlled by the applicant.  In addition, a
statement showing the number of lots or parcels in such block which the
applicant holds under deed, lease or contract from the owner thereof shall be
attached thereto. Also, there shall be attached to such application a map or
plat showing all correct dimensions and the exact location of such proposed
well, together with the locations of all tanks, pits, slush ponds, pipe
lines, embankments, fences and other details of the proposed use of such
property necessary or incident to the drilling, operation and maintenance of
such well, together with the correct measurements of such locations from the
outside boundaries of such block. Such application, with such attachment,
shall be verified before an official who is authorized to administer oaths in
the State and shall thereupon be referred by the Clerk to Council for action.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.06  MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS.



   If there are applications pending at the same time, filed by more than
one applicant, for permits to drill wells in the same block, the application
holding the greatest area of land in such block, by ownership, lease or
contract or any or all such forms of holding, shall be first considered and
acted upon, and those applications holding the next largest area of land in
such block shall be considered and acted upon in turn.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.07  FEES.



   (a)   Permit Fees. All applicants for a permit to drill an oil or
gas well in the City shall pay to the City Clerk, at the time of filing such
application, a deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00) as a fee to apply to
the costs and expenses of administering this chapter, of which seventy-five
dollars ($75. 00) shall be refunded to such applicant if the permit is not
granted.  Each applicant for a permit to lay a pipeline along or across a
street, alley, highway, parking space, sidewalk area or other public property
shall pay to the Clerk, at the time of filing such application, a fee of
twenty-five cents (250) per rod or part thereof, but in no event less than
ten dollars ($10. 00), to cover the costs and expenses of administering this
chapter, of which seventy-five percent shall be refunded to the applicant if
such permit is not granted.  No permit to drill a well shall be granted by
Council unless and until the applicant therefor has paid to the City the one
hundred dollar ($100.00) deposit required by this section.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60; Ord. 316.  Passed 5-18-64.)



   (b)   Annual Fees.  On the first Monday in May after the completion
of a producing well and a pipeline for which a permit is required under this
chapter, and annually thereafter so long as such operations continue, the
owner of such pipeline shall pay to the City ten cents (10£) per rod, but
not less than ten dollars ($10.00), and the owner of such well shall pay to
the City fifty dollars ($50.00), as fees to apply to the cost of
administering this chapter.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.08  REFUSAL OF PERMIT.



   Council has the right, power and authority to refuse to grant a permit
applied for under this chapter, because of the location of the proposed well
or pipeline and/or the character and value of the permanent improvements
already erected in the vicinity of such proposed well or pipeline, because of
the use to which the land and surroundings are adopted or because of sanitary
reasons, for which reasons the drilling of such well or the laying of such
pipeline, in the judgment of Council, would be a serious detriment to the
City and to the health, welfare or property of its inhabitants.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.09  REVOCATION OF PERMIT.



   A permit for drilling an oil or gas well may be revoked by Council,
when drilling operations have not been commenced in good faith within sixty
days from the date of the issuance thereof, or if such drilling operations,
when commenced, have ceased for a period of sixty days, or when production
from such well, if obtained, has ceased for a period of ninety days.  If
such permit is revoked, no person shall continue the drilling or operation of
the well involved without the application for and issuance of another permit
to do so.

excavation for pipelines, the depth thereof and the location thereof with
particular reference to all structures and property lines and also showing
the exact location of any public utility property as well as sidewalks,
pavements and other improvements, and shall pay a fee of twenty-five cents
(25£) per rod of excavation and/or pipeline, but not less than ten dollars
($10.00), to be applied to the cost of administering this chapter.  Upon
such payment, the Clerk shall refer such plan or map to Council for action. 
The fee provided for herein shall be in addition to the fees provided in
Section 856.07.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.11  BONDS AND INSURANCE.



   No permit for the drilling or putting down of an oil or gas well shall
be issued until the applicant has obtained and filed with the City Clerk a
bond payable to the City, for the use of the City and any person interested,
in the penal sum of not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000), that is
conditioned upon such applicant's compliance with this chapter and that saves
and keeps harmless the City from any claim or demand that may be made against
the City arising out of the operations of such applicant.  The permittee
shall in all respects comply with the provisions of Sections 856.16 and
856.17 and no such permit shall be issued until the applicant has obtained
and filed with the City Clerk public liability insurance in an amount of not
less than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and property damage insurance in
an amount of not less than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000).  All such
bonds and insurance policies shall be issued and signed by a company which is
authorized to do business in the State and shall be approved by Council. 
All such bonds and insurance policies shall be kept in full force and effect
during the operations of the permittee and certifications showing such
continual effectiveness shall be kept on file by such permittee with the City
Clerk.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.12  CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS.



   Before work is commenced under any permit, the permittee shall file
with the City Clerk a written statement, under oath, of all the contractors
and subcontractors connected with the work of erecting the rig and machinery,
drilling of such well or excavating for and/or laying the pipeline, and shall
promptly notify the City Clerk of a change of any such contractor or
subcontractor.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.13  DISPOSAL OF PRODUCTS AND WASTE.



   In operating under a permit issued under this chapter, all oil, gas and
water produced or arising from such operation shall be piped or otherwise
conveyed beyond and outside the City and there disposed of in accordance with
State and Federal laws, except such water as is used and disposed of by the
ordinary use of slush ponds.  All excavations in, or uses of, the streets
and alleys of the City in such operation shall be under the supervision and
direction of the Superintendent of Streets and shall be conducted without
unreasonable obstruction of such streets and alleys and without expense or
cost to the City.  No water or waste matter from any such well or operation
shall be allowed to enter a sanitary or other sewer of the City.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)



856.14  INSPECTIONS.



   An officer, policeman or employee of the City, who is designated by the
Mayor or Council for the purpose, shall have the right and privilege, at any
time, to enter upon the premises covered by an oil or gas drilling permit for
the purpose of making an inspection to determine if the provisions of this
chapter or any other ordinance or applicable law relating to the health and
safety of persons and property within the City are being complied with.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)

with the City, in and by which it is agreed that such applicant will deliver
to the City, free of cost, in the pipeline to which such well may be
connected, a one thirty-second share of such oil or gas as is produced by
such well and shall pay to the City, in cash, monthly, such one thirty-second
share of such products so long as any gas or oil is so produced.

right and privilege of paying to the permittee, within ten days from the date
of issuance of such permit, his or her share and part of the expense of
drilling, including, but not limited to, the cost of the permit and bond and
the actual cost of drilling such well, or of making a good and sufficient
bond to do so. Thereupon he or she shall be permitted to participate in the
seven-eighths working interest therein to the extent that his or her holding
area within such block bears to the entire block.  If there is any unleased
part of such block, the owner of the fee title therein shall have the same
rights as if he or she were the owner of such lease.



   An owner of real estate in any block, whether or not such owner has
made a so-called oil and/or gas lease thereof to another person, shall be
entitled to receive as royalty out of a well drilled on such block such
proportion of the average royalty, which is not less than one-eighth of the
total production of the well, as the area of his or her land bears to the
whole area of such block.  It shall be a condition of a permit issued under
this chapter, whether or not stated therein, that the permittee and his or
her heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives and
assigns shall deliver such royalty to the credit of such owner within such
block, free of cost, in the pipeline to which the well may be connected and
shall pay such owner a like share, as royalty, of the sums provided to be
paid to the lessor in such block by reason of the sale or utilization of gas,
gasoline and casinghead gas from such well, to the end that an owner who is
not a lessor of land in such block shall have the same rights, shares and
royalties in the products of such well, not less than one-eighth, as the
average amount stipulated and set forth in the drilling lease or contract
under the terms of which such well was drilled and is being operated.



(Ord. 286.  Passed 6-6-60.)

completed, in cases where the same is abandoned for the reason that a "dry
hole" is found or for any other reason, the permittee shall fill the slush
pond or pit with dirt and level off the surface. Such permittee shall not
allow any sludge, oil or other offensive or dangerous substance to accumulate
or remain on such premises and at all times shall keep such premises of the
block in a reasonably sanitary and sightly condition.

ensure collection and payment of the fee. When so authorized, it shall be the
duty of such retailer to pay the fee upon all of the gross charges for

form to be provided by the City, provided, however, that any
telecommunications retailer that has filed a return pursuant to Section
890.04(c) of this chapter shall be deemed to have registered in accordance
with this section.



   (b)   Every telecommunications provider who has registered with the
City pursuant to subsection (a) hereof has an affirmative duty to submit an
amended registration form or current return as required by Section 890.04(c),

(Ord. 709.  Passed 10-13-97.)



890.03  IMPOSITION OF FEE.



   (a)   A City telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee is
hereby imposed upon all telecommunications retailers in the amount of two
percent of all gross charges charged by the telecommunications retailer to
service addresses within the City for telecommunications originating or
received in the City.



   (b)   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this chapter, the City infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all
public rights-of-way within the City by telecommunications retailers.
Imposition of the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under this chapter
does not, however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any taxes or
imposition of any fees otherwise authorized by law.



   (c)   The City telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized by this section shall be collected, enforced, and administered as
set forth in Section 890.04 of this Chapter.



(Ord. 709.  Passed 10-13-97; Ord. 783. Passed 9-9-02.)



890.04  COLLECTION, ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.



   (a)   A telecommunications retailer shall charge to and collect from
each customer an additional charge in an amount equal to the City
infrastructure maintenance fee attributable to that customer's service
address.



   (b)   Unless otherwise approved by the City Council, the
infrastructure maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications
retailer to the City not later than the last day of the month subsequent to
the month in which a bill is issued to the customer; provided, however, that
the telecommunications retailer may retain an amount not to exceed two
percent of the City infrastructure maintenance fee collected by it to
reimburse itself for expenses incurred in accounting for and remitting the
fee.



   (c)   Remittance of the City infrastructure maintenance fee to the
City shall be accompanied by a return, in a form to be prescribed by the City
Council, which shall contain such information as the City Council may
reasonably require.



   (d)   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected
pursuant to this chapter and any such infrastructure maintenance fee
collected by such telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by
the telecommunications retailer to the City. The charge imposed under
subsection (a) hereof by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this
chapter shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications
retailer who provides such services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable
at law in the same manner as the original charge for such services.



   (e)   If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure
maintenance fee has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this
chapter, whether as a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then
such amount shall be credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due,
or to become due, under this chapter, from the telecommunications retailer
who made the erroneous payment; provided, however, that the City Council may
request, and the telecommunications retailer shall provide, written
substantiation for such credit. However, no claim for such credit may be made
more than three years after the date of the erroneous payment unless the
credit is used only to offset a claim of underpayment made by the City within
the applicable statutory period of limitations, and the credit derives from
an overpayment made by the same telecommunications retailer during the
applicable statutory period of limitations.



   (f)   Amounts paid under this chapter by telecommunications
retailers shall not be included in the tax base under any of the following
acts:



      (1)   "Gross charges" for purposes of the Telecommunications
Excise Tax Act;



      (2)   "Gross receipts" for purposes of the municipal utility
tax as prescribed in Section 8-11-2 of the Illinois Municipal Code;



      (3)   "Gross charges" for purposes of the municipal
telecommunications tax as prescribed in Section 8-11-17 of the Illinois
Municipal Code; and



      (4)   "Gross revenue" for purposes of the tax on annual gross
revenue of public utilities prescribed in Section 2202 of the Public
Utilities Act.



   (g)   The City shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the
books and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this chapter
to determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted
to the City for the City infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of
the amount of the City infrastructure maintenance fee due to the City by the
telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the City plus five percent of
the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs
incurred by the City in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed five
percent of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit. Said
sum shall be paid to the City within twenty-one days after the date of
issuance of an invoice for same.



   (h)   The City Council, or its designee, may promulgate such further
or additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement of
this chapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time to
time and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered
pursuant to Section 890.02 of this chapter of such regulations.



(Ord. 709.  Passed 10-13-97.)



890.05  COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS.



   Nothing in this chapter shall excuse any person or entity from
obligations imposed under any law, including, but not limited to:



   (a)   Generally applicable taxes;



   (b)   Standards for construction on, over, under, or within, or the
use or repair of, the public rights-of-way, including standards relating to
free standing towers and other structures upon the public rights-of-way, as

   (c)   Any liability imposed for failure to comply with such
generally applicable taxes or standards governing construction on, over,
under, or within, or the use or repair of, the public rights-of-way; and



   (d)   Compliance with any ordinance or provision of these Codified
Ordinances concerning uses or structures not located on, over, or within the
right-of-way.



(Ord. 709.  Passed 10-13-97.)



890.06  EXISTING FRANCHISES AND LICENSES.



   Any franchise, license, or similar agreements between
telecommunications retailers and the City entered into before the effective
date of this chapter regarding the use of public rights-of-way shall remain
valid according to and for their stated terms except for any fees, charges or
other compensation to the extent waived.



(Ord. 709.  Passed 10-13-97.)

   (a)   The City hereby waives all fees, charges, and other
compensation that may accrue, after the effective date of the waiver, to the
City by a telecommunications retailer pursuant to any existing City
franchise, license, or similar agreement with a telecommunications retailer
during the time the City imposes the telecommunications infrastructure
maintenance fee. This waiver shall be effective only during the time the
infrastructure maintenance fee provided for in this chapter is subject to
being lawfully imposed on the telecommunications retailer and collected by
the telecommunications retailer from the customer.



   (b)   The City Clerk shall send a notice of the waiver by certified
mail/return receipt requested to each telecommunications retailer with whom
the City has a franchise.



   (c)   The City infrastructure maintenance fee provided for in this
chapter shall become effective and imposed on the first day of the month not
less than ninety days after the City provides written notice, by certified
mail to each telecommunications retailer with whom the City has an existing
franchise, license, or similar agreement, that the City waives all
compensation under such existing franchise, license, or similar agreement
during such time as the fee is subject to being lawfully imposed and
collected by the retailer and remitted to the City. The infrastructure
maintenance fee shall apply to gross charges billed on or after the effective
date as established in the preceding sentence.

892.07  CERTAIN CREDITS AND REFUNDS.



   (a)   The City shall not refund or credit any taxes voluntarily paid
without written protest at the time of payment in the event that a locally
imposed and administered tax is declared invalidly enacted or
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction. However, a taxpayer
shall not be deemed to have paid the tax voluntarily if the taxpayer lacked
knowledge of the facts upon which to protest the taxes at the time of payment
or if the taxpayer paid the taxes under duress.



   (b)   The statute of limitations on a claim for credit or refund
shall be four or less years after the end of the calendar year in which
payment in error was made. The City shall not grant a credit or refund of
locally imposed and administered taxes, interest, or penalties to a person
who has not paid the amounts directly to the City.



   (c)   The procedure for claiming a credit or refund of locally
imposed and administered taxes, interest or penalties paid in error shall be
as follows:

in writing a claim for credit or refund together with a statement specifying:



         A.   The name of the locally imposed and administered
tax subject to the claim;



         B.   The tax period for the locally imposed and
administered tax subject to the claim;



         C.   The date of the tax payment subject to the claim
and the cancelled check or receipt for the payment;



         D.   The taxpayer's recalculation, accompanied by an
amended or revised tax return, in connection with the claim; and



         E.   A request for either a refund or a credit in
connection with the claim to be applied to the amount of tax, interest and
penalties overpaid, and, as applicable, related interest on the amount
overpaid; provided, however, that there shall be no refund and only a credit
given in the event the taxpayer owes any monies to the City.



   (d)   Within ten (10) days of the receipt by the local tax
administrator of any claim for a refund or credit, the local tax
administrator shall either:



      (1)   Grant the claim; or



      (2)   Deny the claim, in whole or in part, together with a
statement as to the reason for the denial or the partial grant and denial.



   (e)   In the event the local tax administrator grants, in whole or
in part, a claim for refund or credit, the amount of the grant for refund or
credit shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per annum, based on a
year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed, from the date of the
overpayment to the date of mailing of a refund check or the grant of a credit.

      (2)   The time period of the audit; and



      (3)   A brief description of the books and records to be made
available for the auditor.



   (b)   Any audit shall be conducted during normal business hours and

within 30 days after the originally designated audit and during normal
business hours.



   (c)   The taxpayer may request an extension of time to have an audit
conducted. The audit shall be conducted not less than seven days nor more
than 30 days from the date the notice is given, unless the taxpayer and the
local tax administrator agreed to some other convenient time. In the event
taxpayer is unable to comply with the audit on the date in question, the
taxpayer may request another date within the 30 days, approved in writing,
that is convenient to the taxpayer and the local tax administrator.



   (d)   Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the
taxpayer's business or activities, including original source documents and

kept in the English language and shall be subject to and available for
inspection by the City.



   (e)   It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make
available its books and records for inspection by the City. If the taxpayer
or tax collector fails to provide the documents necessary for audit within
the time provided, the local tax administrator may issue a tax determination
and assessment based on the tax administrator's determination of the best
estimate of the taxpayer's tax liability.



   (f)   If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of a
locally imposed and administered tax as a result of the audit, written notice
of the amount of overpayment shall be given to the taxpayer within 30 days of
the City's determination of the amount of overpayment.



   (g)   In the event a tax payment was submitted to the incorrect
local governmental entity, the local tax administrator shall notify the local
governmental entity imposing such tax.



(Ord. 755. Passed 2-12-01.)



892.09  APPEAL.

any tax. The notice shall include the following information:



      (1)   The reason for the assessment;



      (2)   The amount of the tax liability proposed;



      (3)   The procedure for appealing the assessment; and



      (4)   The obligations of the City during the audit, appeal,
refund and collection process.



   (b)   A taxpayer who receives written notice from the local tax
administrator of a determination of tax due or assessment may file with the
local tax administrator a written protest and petition for hearing, setting
forth the basis of the taxpayer's request for a hearing. The written protest
and petition for hearing must be filed with the local tax administrator
within 45 days of receipt of the written notice of the tax determination and
assessment.



   (c)   If a timely written notice and petition for hearing is filed,
the local tax administrator shall fix the time and place for hearing and
shall give written notice to the taxpayer. The hearing shall be scheduled for
a date within 14 days of receipt of the written protest and petition for
hearing, unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.



   (d)   If a written protest and petition for hearing is not filed
within the 45-day period, the tax determination, audit or assessment shall
become a final bill due and owing without further notice.



   (e)   Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the
full payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of
the due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall
the time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing be reopened or
extended for more than 90 days after the expiration of the 45-day period.



(Ord. 755. Passed 2-12-01.)



892.10  HEARING.



   (a)   Whenever a taxpayer or a tax collector has filed a timely
written protest and petition for hearing under section nine, above, the local
tax administrator shall conduct a hearing regarding any appeal.



   (b)   No continuances shall be granted except in cases where a
continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer.
Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance
granted shall not exceed 14 days.



   (c)   At the hearing the local tax administrator shall preside and
shall hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax
determination, audit or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable
to judicial proceedings shall not apply.



   (d)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the local tax administrator

892.11  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.



   In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing,
through audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the
time frame otherwise indicated.



   (a)   Interest. The City hereby provides for the amount of interest
to be assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to
be six percent per annum, based on a year of 365 days and the number of days
elapsed.



   (b)   Late Filing and Payment Penalties. If a tax return is not
filed within the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a
late filing penalty, of five percent of the amount of tax required to be
shown as due on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five
percent of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the
time or manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the
City issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a
failure to file penalty shall be assessed equal to 25 percent of the total
tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was required
to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a failure to
file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance.



(Ord. 755. Passed 2-12-01.)



892.12  ABATEMENT.



   The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate
any late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if
the local tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay
or failure to make a filing.



(Ord. 755. Passed 2-12-01.)



892.13  INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.



   The City may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for
the payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14-day period or fails to demonstrate good
faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator,
the installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the
taxpayer.



(Ord. 755. Passed 2-12-01.)



892.14  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.



   The City, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax
returns in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due
and owing. The taxpayer shall have 45 days after receiving notice of the
reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still
due and owing.



   (a)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than
four years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.



   (b)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year
period for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by
the City, the tax paid was less than 75 percent of the tax due, the statute
of limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year
in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year
in which the return for the applicable period was filed.



   (c)   No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax
return was filed by the taxpayer.



(Ord. 755. Passed 2-12-01.)



892.15  VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.



   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has
not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from
the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application
with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A
taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the
amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent per month, for all
periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years
before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid
voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax,
interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was
filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the
amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with
applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the
result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application
shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be
made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure
application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However,
any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and
interest previously paid under this Section must be paid within 90 days after
a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional
amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever
is longer.



(Ord. 755. Passed 2-12-01.)



892.16  PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES.



   Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the City
Clerk's office.



(Ord. 755. Passed 2-12-01.)



892.17  INTERNAL REVIEW PROCEDURE.



   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review
procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes.
Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid,
the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to
be improper, the local tax administrator shall:



   (a)   Timely remove the lien at the City's expense;



   (b)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and



   (c)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.



(Ord. 755. Passed 2-12-01.)



892.18  APPLICATION.



   This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to
supplement all of the City's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax
ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter
shall be controlling.



(Ord. 755. Passed 2-12-01.)



892.19  SEVERABILITY.

unenforceability of such section, paragraph or provision shall not affect any
of the remaining provisions of this chapter.

the City.  A separate service shall also be furnished to each separate
business using water upon the same property or within the same building. If

application must be accompanied by a deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00)
(whether water or sewer) for property owners, or a deposit of one hundred
sixty dollars ($160.00) for renters, lessees or contract purchasers, which
deposit shall be returned to owners at the end of one year if there is no
delinquency in the customer’s account.  Water and sewer deposits for a
renter, lessee or contract purchaser shall be retained until the customer
vacates the premises, at which time the deposits shall be returned if there
is no delinquency in such customer's account.  If the customer's account
becomes delinquent, the City may apply all or as much of such deposit as is
necessary to pay the delinquency.  If a customer moves in less than one year
and there is no delinquency, the full amount of the deposit shall be returned
to him or her.  Such deposit is required whether the applicant asks for a
new tap or for water service where a tap has previously been made.

1040.13  TAP-INS; FEE.



   Each applicant for a water tap who resides in the City shall pay a fee
of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for tapping into the City water line.  Each
customer who resides outside the City shall pay a fee of eight hundred
dollars ($800.00) for tapping into the City water line.  Such fees shall be
in addition to the deposit required by Section 1040.12.



(Ord. 645.  Passed 5-9-94.)



1040.14  TAP-INS; COSTS; REPAIRS; WATER LEAKS.



   All costs of taps shall be borne by the applicant. The line from the
meter into the applicant's premises shall be the property of the applicant,
and any repairs required at any time to such line shall be paid for by the
user. All such lines shall be buried at a depth to prevent freezing and to
prevent their being damaged or destroyed by any work necessary or proper to
keep the streets and alleys in proper repair. If such service pipes become
damaged by freezing or from any other cause, it shall be the duty of the user
to make immediate repair of the same to prevent waste of water.



   If a water leak is discovered by the Supervisor or reported to the
Supervisor, he or his designated representative shall immediately inspect the
location in question to determine the cause of the water leak. If the
Supervisor determines that the water leak appears to be on the line of the
user, he shall notify such user in writing by certified mail that such water
leak exists and must be repaired within three days of receipt of the notice.
Such notice shall advise the user that if the water leak is not repaired
within three days of the serving of notice upon the user by certified mail,
the water shall be turned off on such line at the curbcock at a fee of twenty
dollars ($20.00) payable to the City. When the Supervisor determines that the
water leak has been satisfactorily repaired, he shall authorize the
restoration of water service upon such line. A fee of twenty dollars ($20.00)
shall be paid by the user to restore such water service. If the Supervisor
determines that a genuine emergency exists with regard to the nature of the
leak and that a large quantity of water is being lost, the Supervisor or his
designated representative shall personally notify the user or owner of the
property that said user or owner has twenty-four hours to repair said leak.



   If the leak is found to be between the meter and the applicant's
premises, and the owner or user does not repair such leak after proper notice
as described above, the City is hereby authorized to hire a registered
plumber to repair such water leak. The City shall pay such plumber and the
City will then bill the property owner and user for the expenses of the
repair. Water service shall not be restored to such customer until the bill
for the repair and a reconnection fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) is paid to
the City by the owner. If a renter or owner requests water service and there
is an unpaid repair bill due the City, the bill shall be paid before the
service is restored.

1040.15  IMPROPER USES OF WATER; CONTROL BY CITY.



   (a)   Council or the Supervisor of City Maintenance shall have the
power to decide what shall be considered a waste or improper use of water and
to restrict the use thereof when deemed necessary, and if the user neglects
or refuses to comply with the directions given by Council or the Supervisor,
the water shall be shut off and shall not again be turned on except by
authorization of Council given at any regular meeting or at a special meeting
called for that purpose. The Supervisor or any member of Council or the Chief
of Police may enter the premises of any water user at all reasonable hours
and examine the service lines and fixtures on such premises to determine the
quantity of water being used and to determine whether or not water is being
wasted or being used for purposes other than that for which application was
made.  The City shall at all times retain control of the corporation cock
and the curb cock.  Whenever, in the judgment of Council, the public
exigencies require it, the City shall have the right and authority, by
proclamation issued by the Mayor and distributed or posted about the City, to
limit or wholly suspend and prohibit, for such length of time as his or her
judgment may require, the drawing or use of water for streets, yards, lawns,
gardens or automobile washing, or any other unnecessary use. No person shall
violate or fail to comply with any such proclamation.



   (b)   No person shall permit water to be wasted by leaving a hose
unattended and not in necessary use, permit water to run to prevent the
freezing of pipes or fixtures or waste water from the water system of the
City in any other manner. (Ord. 570.    Passed 11-14-88.)



1040.16  CONNECTION OF SERVICE PIPES.



   All connections of service pipes with street mains shall be made by or
under the supervision of a registered plumber and under the direction of the
Supervisor of City Maintenance, and in no case shall a connection to the
water main be less than fifteen inches from either end of the section of the
main so tapped. Connections for service to the main shall be made with a
meter tile and lid and a copper setter using the following specifications:

1040.18  LOCATION AND INSTALLATION OF METERS.



   (a)   Meters shall be placed as provided for the placing of meter
tile and copper setter so far as possible and convenient, but nothing herein
shall prohibit the placing of the meter in such other place as convenience
may require. All meters shall be installed in a proper meter box or other
place for the proper protection of such meters and the direction of the
Supervisor of City Maintenance as to the location of such meters shall
prevail so long as such direction is reasonable.



   (b)   It is deemed essential for the economical operation of the
waterworks system of the City that each and every user of water from such
system be placed on a meter as soon as practical.    The Supervisor is
hereby authorized to install meters as fast as funds become available for
such purpose and such Supex'visor is hereby authorized to use his or her best
judgment in determining which customers shall first be supplied with meters
until such time as all customers can be supplied.  Any water user who
refuses to permit his or her premises to be entered for the purpose of
placing a meter where conditions do not permit the placing of the meter on
City property is hereby declared subject to having his or her water supply
discontinued until such time as he or she permits the placing of the meter to
properly register the amount of water being used.

1040.21  EXCAVATIONS.



   In excavations in streets, alleys or sidewalks for laying of pipes or
making repairs, the earth, brick, concrete or other material removed must be
deposited in a manner that will occasion the least inconvenience to the
public and provide for the passage of water along the gutters.  No person
shall leave any such excavation in any street, alley or sidewalk open at any
time without proper barricades, and, at night, red or amber warning lights
shall be maintained at such places.  Plumbers shall be held responsible on
their bonds for damages if such protection is not given.  In refilling the
opening after the service pipe has been laid, or repairs made, the earth must
be laid in layers not more than nine inches in depth and each layer
thoroughly tamped or puddled to prevent settling.  All sidewalks, paving and
other material must be replaced with like material to leave the streets,
alleys and sidewalks in as good a condition as they were before being
disturbed, and satisfactory to the Supervisor of City Maintenance. All
excavations on City property shall be backfilled using CAG No. 6 stone and
shall be approved by the Supervisor.

1040.22  PLUMBING; BOND REQUIRED; LICENSED PLUMBER REQUIRED.



   (a)   No person engaged in the plumbing business, or contracting for
the installation of plumbing, shall do any plumbing in the City until such
person has posted a bond of one thousand dollars ($1, 000), payable to the
City and conditioned on such person’s abiding by and observing all
ordinances of the City and all rules and regulations made in connection with
the waterworks and sewerage systems of the City in installing any and all
plumbing and sewer connections in the City.



   (b)   All tap-ons, connection and repairs to water and sewer lines
performed on City property must be under the direction of a licensed plumber
and must be inspected by the City Maintenance Supervisor or his or her
designate.  City employees shall be authorized to maintain and repair the
City water and sewer lines.



(Ord. 570.  Passed 11-14-88; Ord. 967.  Passed 10-12-16.)



1040.23  STOP AND WASTE COCKS.



   There shall be placed in the service pipe, immediately within the wall
of the building to which service is connected, a brass stop cock with waste,
easily accessible and at such point that all water may be drained out of the
pipe within the building for the protection of the building, its occupants
and contents in case of the development of a leak, and to prevent the
freezing of pipes and fixtures by the use of such stop cock.



(Ord. 570.  Passed 11-14-88.)



1040.24  YARD HYDRANTS.



   Only standard hydrants may be installed in yards in accordance with the
State Plumbing Code. In any case where a building contains no plumbing, it
shall be permissible to install a standard yard hydrant. However, where a
meter has been installed, in no case shall an opening be made in a service
pipe before it enters the meter.



(Ord. 570.  Passed 11-14-88.)



1040.25  WATER BILLS.



   (a)   Water bills based on the schedules contained in this chapter
are due on and after the first day of each and every calendar month for water
service for the preceding month and are delinquent if not paid by 5:00 p.m.
on or before the fifteenth day of each month. It shall be the duty of the
Supervisor of City Maintenance to have bills rendered to the users each
month, but failure to render does not excuse the user from making prompt
payment of the bill. If a water bill is delinquent, a penalty of ten percent
of the amount due shall be added for the purpose of taking care of the
additional bookkeeping thus necessitated. The Supervisor shall discontinue
service without further notice if the charges for services are not paid
within sixty days after the bill for such services has been rendered. Such
services shall not be reinstated until all claims are settled. A fee of
twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be charged for disconnection of any water
service because of delinquency. There shall be a fee of twenty dollars
($20.00) for reinstating such service. If both water and sewer bills are
delinquent, there shall be only a single charge for disconnection and/or
reinstating such service.



   (b)   Whenever a monthly bill for water service remains unpaid for
ninety days after it has been rendered, the City Attorney shall, at the
direction of Council, file with the County Recorder of Deeds a statement of
lien claim. This statement shall contain the legal description of the
premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill and a notice that the City
claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges subsequent to the
period covered by the bill. 



   If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and
the Supervisor has notice of this, notice shall be mailed to the owner of the
premises, if his or her address is known to the Supervisor, whenever such
bill remains unpaid for forty-five days after it has been rendered.



   The failure of the City Attorney to record such lien, the failure of
the Supervisor to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive
such notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills.

excavation in any street, alley or public walk, or injure or deface any fire
hydrant, water main, service line, curb cock, meter, curb cock box, meter box

bill, or do anything to injure, deface, obstruct or impair the waterworks
system or any part thereof or any building, machinery or appliance thereof.

   There shall be established a Water Fund into which there shall be paid
all funds and moneys derived from the revenue of the water system. The money
in such Fund shall be used for the reasonable expenses of operation,
maintenance and repair of the waterworks system, and of replacements to such
system, at the specific direction of Council. From the Fund there shall be
set aside, in a separate account, an amount of at least twenty-five thousand
dollars ($25,000), to be used from time to time for repair, maintenance and
replacement of water lines and the water system.

1040.30  WATER SERVICE SHUT-OFF VALVES.



   All water customers of the City shall have individual water service
shut-off valves located conveniently upon the property and accessible to
Water Department employees of the City. The installation and maintenance of
this valve shall be the responsibility of the property owner. If this section
is not complied with by the property owner, the City shall, at its
discretion, install such valve and bill the property owner for the labor and
material. The City may install such water valve if the property owner fails
to do so after a notice in writing has been mailed by certified mail to the
property owner giving him or her sixty days in which to install the same. If
the City installs the valve and the property owner fails to pay the bill for
installation within thirty days after receiving the bill from the City, a
notice of lien for the costs and expenses thereof incurred by the City shall
be recorded in the following manner:



   (a)   The City shall file a notice of lien in the office of the
County Clerk.



   (b)   The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting
out:



      (1)   A description of the real estate involved which is
sufficient for identification thereof;



      (2)   The amount of money representing the costs and expenses
incurred which are payable for such service; and



      (3)   The date when such costs and expenses were incurred by
the City.



   (c)   Such notice shall be filed within sixty days after such costs
and expenses have been incurred and shall become a lien upon the real estate
of the property owner.



   The term "water customer, " as used in this section, refers to any
water service to a residence, including a home, trailer, apartment, mobile
home or any other abode of an individual or family.



   Provided, however, that a landlord engaged in the rental of multiple
units on one tract of real estate may elect to have one meter service all
units on said tract of real estate. In such case, the City shall install and
pay for the water meter. The landlord shall be charged at the commercial
water rate for the City for all water supplied to the multiple units. The
City shall charge the landlord the flat rate for water service for a
three-month period after installment of the meter to enable the landlord to
compute the rate of water usage. At the conclusion of the three-month period,
the landlord shall be billed at the regular commercial water rate for water
furnished to said premises. Landlord shall have the responsibility to notify
the City whether they desire to have a single commercial meter to supply all
multiple units or to treat each unit separately and install their own meter
and shut-off valve. The rental property owner shall be responsible for
payment of the water bill when he elects to have a single water meter supply
all units in multiple unit premises.

   (a)   If, in accordance with the Illinois Plumbing Code Regulation
on Cross-Connection Control for the City (attached to original Ordinance 546,
passed July 13, 1987, as Appendix A) or in the judgment of the Supervisor of
City Maintenance, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary for the
safety of the public water supply system, the Supervisor will give notice to
the water customer to install such an approved device immediately. The water
customer shall, at his or her own expense, install such an approved device at
a location and in a manner in accordance with the Illinois Plumbing Code and
all applicable local regulations, and shall have inspections and tests made
of such approved devices as required by the Illinois Plumbing Code and local
regulations.



   (b)   No person shall establish or maintain or permit to be
established or maintained any connection whereby a private, auxiliary or
emergency water supply, other than the regular public water supply of the
City, enters the supply or distribution system of the City, unless such
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of connection and
use of such supply have been approved by the Supervisor and the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency.



   (c)   The Supervisor shall cause surveys and investigatiops to be
made of industrial and other properties served by the public water supply to
determine whether or not actual or potential hazards to the public water
supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of
public record and shall be repeated at least every two years, or as often as
the Supervisor deems necessary. Records of such surveys shall be maintained
and shall be made available for review for at least five years thereafter.



   (d)   The approved cross-connection control device Inspector may
enter at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to the
public water distribution system of the City for the purpose of verifying the
presence or absence of cross connections. The Supervisor or his or her
authorized agent may enter at any reasonable time any property served by a
connection to the public water distribution system of the City for the
purpose of verifying information submitted by the customer regarding the
required cross-connection control inspection. On demand, the owner, lessee or
occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the Supervisor any
information which he or she may request regarding the piping system or water
use on such property. The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall,
within the discretion of the Supervisor, be deemed evidence of the presence
of improper connections as provided in this section.



   (e)   The Supervisor is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water
service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this section
is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he or she
may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public
water supply distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be
restored until such conditions have been eliminated or corrected in
compliance with this section, and until the reconnection fee is paid.
Immediate disconnection with verbal notice can be effected when the
Supervisor is assured that an imminent danger of harmful contamination of the
public water supply system exists. Such action shall be followed by written
notification of the cause of disconnection.



   (f)   The consumer responsible for back-siphoned material or
contamination through backflow, if contamination of the potable water supply
system occurs through an illegal cross connection or an improperly installed,
maintained or repaired device, or a device which has been bypassed, must bear
the cost of clean-up of the potable water supply system.

carrying industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and
analyses of waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and
any special conditions for discharge established by the City or regulatory
agencies having jurisdiction over the discharge.



   The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed
by the owner shall be as stipulated by the City, but not less than once per
year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the
wastewater discharge to ensure compliance with Federal, State and local
standards. The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory
analyses to the City at such times and in such a manner as prescribed by the
City. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and
reporting required by the City. At such times as deemed necessary, the City
may take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside laboratory
service.



   (b)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency Division of Laboratories Manual of Laboratory
Methods, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon
suitable samples taken at such control manhole. If no special manhole has
been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building
sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted
methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular
analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be
taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from twenty-four hour composites of outfalls, whereas pH is
determined from periodic grab samples.

(Ord. 569.  Passed 9-21-88.)



1043.11  WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.



   (a)   Basis.



      (1)   The wastewater service charge for the use of and for
service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the City shall consist of a
basic user charge for operation and maintenance, plus replacement, applicable
surcharges and a local capital cost charge composed of a debt service charge
and a capital improvement charge.



      (2)   The debt service charge is computed by dividing the
annual debt service of all outstanding bonds by the number of users. Through
further divisions, the monthly and/or quarterly debt service charges can be
computed. The debt service charge is computed as a fixed charge, plus a
charge per 1,000 gallons.



      (3)   The capital improvement charge is levied on all users to
provide for capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of the sewage
treatment works. The capital improvement is computed by apportioning the
annual amount to be accrued as a cost per 1,000 gallons or as a fixed charge
per month.



      (4)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having a five-day,
twenty-degree Centigrade biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 300 mg/l and a
suspended solids (SS) content of 350 mg/l. These amounts are considered
normal domestic concentrations. The basic user charge shall consist of
operation and maintenance costs, plus replacement, and shall be computed as
follows:



         A.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds
of BOD to be treated.



         B.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to
operate and maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund,
for the year for all works categories.



         C.   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and
replacement costs to each user class by volume, suspended solids and BOD.



         D.   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and
replacement costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended
solids and BOD.



         E.   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage
strength.



         F.   Compute surcharge costs per pound per 1,000 gallons
in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.



      (5)   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters
exceed the normal domestic concentrations of BOD (300 mg/l) and SS (350
mg/l). The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters
and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the 300 mg/l and 3500 mg/l
concentration for BOD and SS respectively. Subsection (f) hereof specifies
the procedure to compute a surcharge.



      (6)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be
reviewed, not less often than annually, by certified public accountants for
the City in their annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be
revised periodically to reflect a change in local capital costs or a change
in operation and maintenance costs, including replacement costs.



      (7)   The users of wastewater treatment services will be
notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that
portion of the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater
treatment operation, maintenance and replacement.



   (b)   Measurement of Flow.



      (1)   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges
and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even
increments of 100 gallons.



      (2)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers
procures any part or all of his or her water from sources other than the
public waterworks system, all or a part of which is discharged into the
public sewers, the person shall install and maintain, at his or her expense,
water meters of a type approved by the Supervisor of City Maintenance for the
purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources.



      (3)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may
be required by the Supervisor if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined
from the metered water consumption records.



      (4)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste
shall be installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval
and installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is
cancelled, without the consent of the Supervisor.



   (c)   Debt Service Charge. A debt service charge of four dollars and
ten cents ($4.10) per month to each user of the wastewater facility of the
City is hereby established. 



(Ord. 569.  Passed 9-21-88.)



   (d)   Basic User Rate. There is hereby established a minimum charge
and a basic user rate for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the City. A minimum charge of sixteen dollars and
twenty cents ($16.20) shall be applied to all users whose water consumption
does not exceed 5,000 gallons per month.



   A basic user rate of ninety-five cents ($0.95) per 1,000 gallons shall
be applied to all users for water consumption in excess of 5,000 gallons per
month.



   All nonmetered residential users of the wastewater facilities shall pay
a minimum flat rate charge per month adequate to cover the costs of the
minimum accrual capital cost charge, the minimum service charge and the basic
user rate of sixteen dollars and twenty cents ($16.20).



   If a sewer customer will be gone for a period of more than thirty days,
the customer may apply for a vacation rate of seven dollars ($7.00) per month
during the period the premises are vacant. 



(Ord. 743.  Passed 11-8-99; Ord. 786. Passed 10-14-02; Ord. 811. Passed
9-13-04; Ord. 861.  Passed 4-14-08.)



   (e)   Surcharge Rate. The rates of surcharges for BOD and SS shall
be as follows:



      (1)   Per pound of BOD:            0.07



      (2)   Per pound of SS:               0.06



   (f)   Computation of Surcharge. The concentration of wastes used for
computing surcharges shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling
shall be performed as often as may be deemed necessary by the Supervisor and
shall be binding as a basis for surcharges.



   (g)   Computation of Wastewater Service Charge. The wastewater
service charge shall be computed by the following formula:



   CW = CC + CD + CM + (Vu-X) CU + CS



   Where       CW   =   Amount of waste service charge ($) per
billing period



            CD   =   Debt service charge



            CC   =   Capital improvement charge



            CM   =   Minimum charge for operation,
maintenance and replacement



            Vu   =   Wastewater volume for the billing
period



            X   =   Allowable consumption in gallons for
the minimum charge



            CU   =   Basic user rate for operation,
maintenance and replacement



            CS   =   Amount of surcharge



(Ord. 569.  Passed 9-21-88.)



1043.12  BILLING PROCEDURE; LIENS.



   (a)   Liability for and Manner of Payments. Rates or charges for
wastewater service shall be payable monthly. The owner of the premises, the
occupant thereof and the user of the service shall be jointly and severally
liable to pay for the service to such premises. The service is furnished to
the premises by the City only upon the condition that such owner, occupant
and user are jointly and severally liable therefor to the City.



   Bills for sewer service shall be sent out by the City Water Clerk on
the first day of the month succeeding the period for which the service is
billed.



   All sewer bills are due and payable fifteen days after being sent out.
A penalty of ten percent shall be added to all bills not paid by the
fifteenth day after they have been rendered.



   (b)   Delinquent Bills. If the charges for such services are not
paid within sixty days after the rendition of the bill for such services,
such services shall be discontinued without further notice and shall not be
reinstated until all claims are settled. A fee of twenty dollars ($20.00)
shall be charged for disconnection of any sewer service because of
delinquency. There shall be a fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) for reinstating
such service.



   (c)   Notice of Delinquency. Whenever a bill for monthly sewer
service remains unpaid for ninety days after it has been rendered, the City
Attorney shall, at the direction of Council, file with the County Recorder of
Deeds a statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain the legal
description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill and a
notice that the City claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges
subsequent to the period covered by the bill.



   If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and
the Supervisor has notice of this, notice shall be mailed to the owner of the
premises, if his or her address is known to the Supervisor, whenever such
monthly bill remains unpaid for forty-five days after it has been rendered.



   The failure of the City Attorney to record such lien, the failure of
the Supervisor to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive
such notice shall not affect the right to foreclosure the lien for unpaid
bills.



   (d)   Foreclosure of Lien. Property subject to a lien for unpaid
charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the
sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the
case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be in
equity in the name of the City. The City Attorney is hereby authorized and
directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the City in any court
having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the
monthly bill has remained unpaid for forty-five days.



(Ord. 569.  Passed 9-21-88.)



1043.13  SEWERAGE FUND.



   All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of the sewerage
system shall be deposited in the sewerage account of the Sewerage Fund. All
such revenues and moneys shall be held by the City Treasurer separate and
apart from his or her private funds and separate and apart from all other
funds of the City. All of such funds, without any deductions whatever, shall
be delivered to the City Treasurer not more than ten days after receipt of
the same, or at more frequent intervals as may from time to time be directed
by the Mayor and Council.



   The City Treasurer shall receive all such revenues from the sewerage
system and all other funds and moneys incident to the operation of such
system as the same may be delivered to him or her, and shall deposit the same
in the account of the fund designated as the Sewerage Fund of the City. The
City Treasurer shall administer such Fund in every respect in the manner
provided by the Illinois Municipal Code, Chapter 24 of the Illinois Revised
Statutes, as revised and amended.



(Ord. 569.  Passed 9-21-88.)



1043.14  ACCOUNTS; AUDITS.



   The City Treasurer shall establish a proper system of accounts and
shall keep proper books, records and accounts in which complete and correct
entries shall be made of all transactions relative to the sewerage system. At
regular annual intervals he or she shall cause to be made an audit by an
independent auditing concern of the books to show the receipts and
disbursements of the sewerage system.



   In addition to the customary operating statements, the annual audit
report shall also reflect the revenues and operating expenses of the
wastewater facilities, including a replacement cost, to indicate that sewer
service charges under the waste cost recovery system and capital amounts
required to be recovered under the industrial cost recovery system do in fact
meet these regulations. In this regard, the financial information to be shown
in the audit report shall include the following:



   (a)   Flow data showing total gallons received at the wastewater
plant for the current fiscal year;



   (b)   Billing data to show the total number of gallons billed per
fiscal year;

   (e)   The number of nonmetered users; and



   (f)   A list of users discharging nondomestic and industrial wastes
and the volume of waste discharged.



(Ord. 569.  Passed 9-21-88.)



1043.15  ACCESS TO RECORDS.



   The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency or its authorized
representative shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records
of the City which are applicable to the City system of user charges for the
purpose of making an audit, examination, excerpts and transcriptions thereof
to ensure compliance with the terms of the special and general conditions of
any State grant and the Federal regulations and conditions of the Federal
grant.



(Ord. 569.  Passed 9-21-88.)



1043.16  RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPAIRS; LICENSED PLUMBER.



   (a)   The sewer line from the City sewer main to the owner’s
premises shall be the property of the owner and any repairs required at any
time to such sewer line shall be paid for by the owner. If such sewer pipes
become damaged, the owner shall make immediate repair of the same to prevent
an unlawful discharge to the sewer.



   (b)   If a sewer leak is discovered by the Supervisor of City
Maintenance or reported to the Supervisor, he or she shall immediately
inspect the location in question to determine the cause of the sewer leak. If
the Supervisor determines that the sewer leak appears to be on the line of
the user, he or she shall notify such owner and user (if different) in
writing, by certified mail, that such sewer leak exists and must be repaired
within ten days. Such notice shall advise the owner and user that if the
sewer leak is not repaired within ten days of the serving of notice upon the
owner and user by certified mail, the water and sewer service of the City
shall be turned off on such line. When the Supervisor determines that the
sewer leak has been satisfactorily repaired, he or she shall authorize the
restoration of water and sewer service upon such line. If the leak is found
to be between the main and the boundary line of the owner’s property, and
the owner or user does not repair such leak after proper notice, the City is
hereby authorized to hire a registered plumber to repair such sewer leak. The
City shall pay such plumber and will then bill the property owner for the
expense of the repair. Water and sewer service shall not be restored to such
owner or user until the bill for the repair is paid to the City by the owner.
If a renter or owner requests water and sewer service and there is an unpaid
repair bill due the City, the bill shall be paid before service is restored.



   (c)   All tap-ons, connection and repairs to water and sewer lines
performed on City property must be under the direction of a licensed plumber
and must be inspected by the City Maintenance Supervisor or his or her
designate.  City employees shall be authorized to maintain and repair the
City water and sewer lines.

   In any district where the average depth of any two or more existing
front yards on lots, within 100 feet of, and in the same block-front as, the
lot in question, is less or greater than the least front yard depth
prescribed, front yards may be varied. The depth of the front yard on such

with the side lot line or is broken or irregular, the average width of the
side yard shall be not less than the otherwise required width, provided,
however, that such side yard is not narrower at any point than one-half the
otherwise required width or narrower than five feet in any case.

The Board shall consist of seven members to be appointed by the Mayor with
the advice and consent of Council.  Whenever it is practical, in the
judgment of Council, two members of the Board shall also be members of the
Planning Commission and one other member of the Board shall be a member of
Council.  The terms of office of any such members of the Board shall in no
event extend beyond the terms of such members of the Planning Commission and

respectively for the following terms or until their respective successors are
appointed and qualified: One member for one year, one member for two years,
one member for three years, one member for four years, one member for five
years, one member for six years and one member for seven years. The successor
to each member so appointed shall serve for five years. One of the members so
appointed shall be named by the Mayor as Chairman of the Board at the time of
his or her appointment.  The appointing authority has the power to remove
any member of the Board for cause, after a public hearing.  Vacancies shall
be filled by the appointing authority for the unexpired term of any member
whose place has become vacant for any reason.



   (b)   All meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
Chairman and at such other times as the Board may determine.  The Chairman
or, in his or her absence, the acting Chairman, may administer oaths, and
compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be open
to the public.  Within the framework of applicable law, the Board shall make
and adopt its own rules of order and rules of procedure, which shall be
binding upon all parties concerned until lawfully changed.  The Board, by
its Secretary, shall keep and preserve accurate minutes of all its official
actions and meetings, showing the vote of each member upon every question, or
if a member is absent or falls to vote, indicating that fact.  Every rule 
and regulation, or amendment or repeal thereof, and every order, requirement,
decision or determination of the Board, shall immediately be reduced to
writing and filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record.

prescribed by the rules of the Board and shall be taken by filing with the
Zoning Administrator and the Board a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds
thereof, together with such plans, plats and exhibits as are reasonably
necessary. Such appeals shall be taken upon forms prescribed by the Board. 
Such Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers and
documents constituting the record of the matter in his or her office.



   (a)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings and furtherance of the
action appealed from, unless the Administrator certifies to the Board, after
the notice of appeal has been filed with him or her, that by reason of facts
stated in the certificate issued by him or her, that a stay would, in his or
her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which,
on proper showing, may be granted by the Board or by a competent court in a
proper action, with due notice to the Administrator and on due cause shown.



   (b)   The Board shall hear and decide all appeals from, and shall
review, any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an
administrative official and shall hear and decide all matters referred to it
or upon which it is required to pass, under the provisions of this Zoning
Code.  The concurrence of four members of the Board is necessary, in a vote,
to reverse an order, requirement, decision or determination of an
administrative official, to decide, in favor of an appellant,  any matter
upon which it is required to pass hereunder, to effect a variation of the
provisions of this Zoning Code or to recommend a variation or modification of
this Zoning Code to Council.



   (c)   Any and all pertinent and applicable provisions contained in
Division Thirteen, Article Eleven, of Chapter Twenty-Four of the Illinois
Revised Statutes (the Cities and Villages Act), as amended, are hereby

herein.  The same shall be observed and followed by the Board in all of its
official acts and actions in relation hereto.



   (d)   Until otherwise fixed by Council, a fee of ten dollars
($10.00) shall be paid to the Secretary of the Board (to be paid over to the
City Treasurer) at the time a notice of appeal is filed.



(Ord. 340.  Passed 12-19-66.)



1290.04  FEES.



   Council shall have the right, power and authority to fix the fees to be

compliance, variations, zoning amendments, appeals to the Board of Zoning
Appeals and other related matters provided for or permitted by this Zoning
Code and may change such fees from time to time.  Unless otherwise provided
for, such fees shall be paid to the City Clerk, who shall give a receipt
therefor, keep a record thereof and turn the same over to the City Treasurer,
taking the Treasurer's receipt therefor.

City, by concurrence in the establishment of the project right-of-way lines,
will permit the State to enter to perform all necessary construction
operations.



   (b)   "Encroachment" means a building, fence, sign or other
structure or object of any kind (with the exception of utilities and public
road signs), which is placed, located or maintained in, on, under or over any

sign advertising activity on the property or similar overhanging structure
supported from a building immediately adjacent to the limits of the platted
street on which there is a sidewalk extending to the building line, which
awning, marquee or sign does not impair the free and safe flow of traffic on
the highway.  The permissive retention of overhanging signs is not to be
construed as being applicable to those signs sup-ported from poles
constructed outside the project right-of-way line and not con-fined by
adjacent buildings.



   (d)   "Project right of way" means an area within the project

1450.05  DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.



   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law
shall commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the Zoning and Building Administrator. The Building
and Zoning Administrator shall not issue a development permit if the proposed
development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.



   (a)   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:



      (1)   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property
line dimensions;

can be shown by the base flood elevation. Any development located on land
that can be shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood
elevation and which has not been filled after the date of the site’s first
Flood Insurance Rate Map is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject
to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development located on
land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected,
but not shown on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map, is subject to the
provisions of this chapter.

documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.



      (3)   The Building and Zoning Administrator shall be
responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other Federal,
State, and local permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may
be required for this type of activity. The Building and Zoning Administrator
shall not issue a permit unless all other Federal, State, and local permits
have been obtained.

(Ord. 880.  Passed 10-14-09.)



1450.11  VARIANCES.



   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Planning
Commission for a variance. The Planning Commission shall review the
applicant’s request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to
the City Council. The Planning Commission may attach such conditions to
granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this
chapter.



   (a)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that all of the following conditions are met:



      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the
floodplain;



      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance
were not granted;



      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;



      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health,
safety or creation of a nuisance;



      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood
protection, rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads,
utilities, or other public facilities;



      (6)   The applicant’s circumstances are unique and do not
establish a pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and



      (7)   All other State and Federal permits have been obtained.



   (b)   The Planning Commission shall notify an applicant in writing
that a variance from the requirements of the building protections standards
of Section 1450.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:



      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage;



      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property; and



      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of
these risks and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of
the risk and liability.



   (c)   Variances to the building protection requirements of Section
1450.07 which are requested in connection with reconstruction, repair, or
alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in “Historic
Structures,” may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of Sections 1450.06 and 1450.07 subject to the conditions that:



      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.



      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the
structure being removed as a certified historic structure.



(Ord. 880.  Passed 10-14-09.)



1450.12  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the
floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create
liability on the part of the City of Christopher or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.



(Ord. 880.  Passed 10-14-09.)



1450.13  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   Ordinance No. 880 repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the
City Council to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program. However, Ordinance No. 880 does not repeal the original resolution
or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does
Ordinance No. 880 repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance
easements, covenants or deed restrictions, conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.



(Ord. 880.  Passed 10-14-09.)



1450.14  SEVERABILITY.



   The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed separable
and the invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the
validity of the remainder.



(Ord. 880.  Passed 10-14-09.)



1450.99  PENALTY.



   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure
to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be
a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Municipal Attorney
may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this ordinance
exists. The Municipal Attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such
violation.



   (a)   If such owner fails after ten days’ notice to correct the
violation:



      (1)   The City of Christopher shall make application to the
circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or
make such other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with
this chapter;

conviction thereof be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than
seven hundred fifty ($750.00) for each offense;



      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues; and



      (4)   The City of Christopher shall record a notice of
violation on the title of the property.



   (b)   (1)   The Municipal Attorney shall inform the owner that
any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.



      (2)   The Municipal Attorney is authorized to issue an order
requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order
shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order
the action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the
stop-work order. The stop-work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.



      (3)   A.   No site development permit shall be permanently
suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the Planning Commission.
Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall
state:



            1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for
suspension or revocation, and



            2.   The time and place of the hearing.



         B.   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an
opportunity to present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the Planning Commission shall determine whether the permit shall be
suspended or revoked.



   (c)   Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Christopher from
taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All
costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
