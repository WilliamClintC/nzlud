PREFACE 
    The Exeter, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1979, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement 7, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Robert Moock, city attorney. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an Ordinance Disposition Table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 7, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through February 12, 2013, by Ordinance No. 661 .

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are "Reserved" for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 7, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 7, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your Code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due when the transient ceases to occupy space in the hotel. If the tax due is not paid to the operator, such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator.

Persons engaged in such business must so register not later than January 1, 1965, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, but such privilege of registration after the date of imposition of such tax shall not relieve any person from the obligation of collection and payment of tax on and after the date of imposition thereof, regardless of registration. Such registration form shall set forth the name under which such person transacts or intends to transact business, the location of his place or places of business, and such other information to facilitate the collection of the tax as the tax collector may require.

The tax collector shall, within ten days after receiving such registration form, issue without charge a certificate of authority to each registrant to collect the tax from transients, together with a duplicate thereof for each additional place of business of such registrant. Such certificates shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the tax collector upon the cessation of business at the location named or upon sale or transfer of the hotel. Each certificate shall be prominently displayed in the hotel so as to be seen and come to the notice readily of all occupants and persons seeking occupancy. The certificate shall contain the following information: 
A.  The name of the operator; 
B.  The address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued;

    "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient Occupancy Tax Law of the City of Exeter by registering with the Tax Collector for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Collector.

Nothing in this section shall be construed as constituting payment of any remittance required, unless such remittance is actually received by the tax collector. 
(Ord. 241 §8, 1964). 
3.24.090 - Nonpayment-Original delinquency. 
    Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required by Section 3.24.070 shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the total amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

3.24.140 - Failure to collect and report tax. 
    If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax collector shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax collector secures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. When such determination has been made, the tax collector shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known address. Such operator may, within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the tax collector for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the ten-day period, the tax, interest and penalties determined by the tax collector shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax collector shall give not less than five days' written notice to the operator, in the manner prescribed in this section, to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax collector shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the operator in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.

One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for any period. The tax collector shall give to the operator written notice of his determination in the same manner as provided in Section 3.24.140. The operator shall be entitled to apply for a hearing on the amount assessed to him pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 3.24.140 and shall thereafter be entitled to appeal to the city council in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.24.170.

B.  "Grass" means any herbaceous plant which is cultivated and which attains, when mature, if uncontrolled, such a height as to be a medium for the rapid spread of fire. 
C.  "Rank growth" means a cover of vegetation of any type, cultivated or not, including trees, which has attained or will, if allowed to mature, attain such a height and density as to be a medium for the rapid spread of fire. 
D.  "Rubbish" means material of whatever value placed or allowed to accumulate so as to be a medium for the rapid spread of fire. 
E.  "Weed" means any plant, whether herbaceous or woody and of whatever height, except a tree, which grows wild.

F.  Contain a statement that, unless the owner corrects the fire hazardous condition or requests a hearing before the city council to appeal the determination of the department of public works, the county fire warden will abate the nuisance, not less than fifteen business days after the date the notice was mailed or personally delivered. It shall also state that the cost of such abatement, together with a charge for the cost of administration of the abatement program attributable to the abatement, will be a special assessment added to the county assessment roll and will become a lien on the real property.

(Ord. 277 §4, 1970).

Chapter 9.08 - CURFEW FOR MINORS 
Sections: 

9.08.010 - Purpose. 
    The city council declares that since it has been determined that the general presence of unsupervised minors on public streets and parking lots between ten p.m. and five a.m. is contrary to the public peace, health, and safety, and has contributed to the delinquency of minors, a worsening of drug-related problems, and an increase in juvenile crime, the purpose of this chapter is to require, with certain exceptions, that minors stay at home or be under adult supervision between ten p.m. and five a.m. to reduce the problems of juvenile delinquency, drugs, and crime. 
    The city council further declares that the community as a whole suffers when a minor student is not attending school. Truancy or unexcused absenteeism from school results in a loss of educational opportunities to the student and a loss of revenue to the school. Truancy also of ten leads to vandalism, petty theft, daytime burglaries, and other criminal activity. Truants often tend to loiter in and about public places. Frequently, persons going about their lawful business, and/or public property, become the targets of delinquent and truant minors during school hours and, hence, an additional purpose of this chapter shall also be to promote the public safety by prohibiting, with certain limited exceptions, the loitering of minors in and about the city during school hours. 
(Ord. 641 § 1, 2006). 
9.08.020 - Intent. 
    The city council desires to establish a curfew ordinance in order to reduce crime and general problems of juvenile delinquency in accordance with the requirements of law. This intent is based upon the following: 
A.  The ability to make reasoned judgments, resist peer pressure and understand the consequences of improper behavior increase with age, knowledge and experience, all of which are likely to increase as a person grows older, and these factors justify the application of a curfew to minors, but not adults. 
B.  Juvenile crime, especially nighttime crime, has increased and other jurisdictions enforcing a nocturnal juvenile curfew have experienced a reduction in crime and noncriminal mischief. 
C.  In the past year, minors have increasingly been victims of violent crime, and the adoption and enforcement of a curfew ordinance will reverse this trend. 
D.  Adopting a curfew ordinance will reinforce parental authority and supervision. 
(Ord. 538 § 1(part), 1994). 
9.08.030 - Definition of a minor. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, any person under the age of eighteen shall be deemed a "minor."

B.  It is unlawful for any minor to loiter, wander, idle, stroll, ride or drive about aimlessly in or upon any public street, curb area, sidewalk, alley, park, playground, public place, public building, place of amusement or eating place, parking lot or unsupervised place between the hours of ten p.m. and five a.m. of the following day.

Chapter 9.24 - DRUG PARAPHERNALIA 
Sections: 

9.24.010 - Purpose. 
    The illegal use of controlled substances within the city creates serious social, medical and law enforcement problems. The illegal use of such substances by persons under eighteen years of age has reached crisis dimensions. It is causing serious physical and psychological damage to the youth of this community, an impairment of educational achievement and of the efficiency of the educational system, increases in nondrug related crime, and a threat to the ability of the community to ensure future generations of responsible and productive adults, all to the detriment of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
    The proliferation of the display of drug paraphernalia in retail stores within the city, and the distribution of such paraphernalia intensifies and otherwise compounds the problem of illegal use of controlled substances within this community. 
    A ban only upon the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia to persons under eighteen years of age would not be effective. The person who displayed or distributed would have difficulty determining who could lawfully view or receive drug paraphernalia. The already thinly staffed law enforcement agencies would be subjected to added enforcement burdens by adding age of a person who views or receives paraphernalia as an element of a prohibition upon display and distribution. A significant number of high school students are eighteen years of age or older. It would be lawful to distribute paraphernalia to some students attending the same school in which the distribution to other students was prohibited. Permitted display and distribution to adults within the community symbolizes a public tolerance of illegal drug use, making it difficult to explain the rationale of programs directed against similar abuse by youth. The problem of illegal consumption of controlled substances by adults within this community is significant and substantial, necessitating a cessation of the encouragement to drug abuse which the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia create. 
    This chapter is a measure which is necessary in order to discourage the illegal use of controlled substances within the city. 
(Ord. 447 §1(part), 1981). 
9.24.020 - Definitions.

C.  "Display" means to show a patron or place in a manner so as to be available for viewing or inspection by a patron. 
D.  "Distribute" means to transfer ownership or a possessory interest to another, whether for consideration or as a gratuity. "Distribute" includes both sales and gifts. 
E.  "Drug paraphernalia" means all equipment, products, and materials of any kind which are intended by a person charged with a violation of this chapter for use in planting, propagating, cultivating, growing, harvesting, manufacturing, compounding, converting, producing, processing, preparing, testing, analyzing, packaging, repacking, storing, containing, concealing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance in violation of any law of the state.

  For statutory provisions authorizing cities to provide for removal as public nuisances of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles, see Vehicle Code §22661(e). 

10.40.010 - Findings and declaration. 
    Pursuant to the determination made and the authority granted by the State Legislature under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code of the state to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof from private and public property as public nuisances, the city council makes the following findings and declarations: 
    The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, not including highways, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle or part thereof on private or public property, not including highways, except as expressly permitted in this chapter, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 318 §1, 1974). 
10.40.020 - Scope. 
    This chapter is not the exclusive regulation of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles within the city.

(Ord. 318 §4, 1974). 
10.40.030 - Definitions. 
    Except where the context otherwise requires, the following definitions shall govern the construction of this chapter: 
A.  "Administrative costs" means the costs to the city, and to the county when acting on behalf of the city pursuant to an agreement, of performing the acts required under this chapter, except the actual removal of the vehicle. The city council may, from time to time by resolution, determine the administrative costs for the removal of each vehicle removed by the city if the vehicle is removed without a hearing pursuant to Section 10.40.090. When the acts required by this chapter are performed by the county acting on behalf of the city, the administrative costs, if the vehicle is removed without a hearing, shall be that amount to be determined from time to time by the board of supervisors to be the administrative costs of removal of abandoned vehicles from unincorporated areas of the county rather than the amount determined by the city council. In those cases in which the police chief conducts a hearing pursuant to Section 10.40.090, he shall fix and determine the administrative costs which shall be the actual cost of performing acts pertaining to the specific vehicle which is the subject of the hearing. 
B.  "Cost of removal" means the actual cost to the city of having the vehicle removed. The city council may, from time to time, by resolution, determine the cost of removal. 
C.  "Highway" means a way or place of whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel. "Highway" also includes streets. 
D.  "Public property" does include "highway." 
E.  "Vehicle" means a device by which any person or property may be propelled, moved or drawn upon a highway, except a device moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks. "Vehicle" also includes any part or portion of a vehicle which is less than a whole vehicle, and all of the provisions of this chapter apply to a part or portion of a vehicle which is less than a whole vehicle. 
(Ord. 519 §1, 1992; Ord. 329 §1, 1975: Ord. 318 §2, 1974).

B.  Nothing in this section shall authorize the maintenance of a public or private nuisance as defined under provisions of law other than Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 22650) of Division 11 of the Vehicle Code of the state and this chapter.

The statement shall include notice to the property owner that he may appear in person at a hearing or may present a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land with the reasons for such denial, in lieu of appearing. The notice of intention to abate shall be mailed, by certified mail, to the owner of the land as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and to the last registered and legal owners of record of the vehicle unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership. 
(Ord. 318 §8, 1974). 
10.40.070 - Abatement and removal-Request for hearing. 
    The registered or legal owner of the vehicle or the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located may request a hearing on the question of abatement and removal of the abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle and on the question of assessment of the administrative costs and cost of removal against the property on which it is located. Such request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed with the chief of police not more than ten days after the date on which the notice of intention described in Section 10.40.060 was mailed by the chief of police. If the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located files with the chief of police a sworn statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land within the ten-day period, the statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting such request. 
(Ord. 318 §9, 1974).

    If no hearing is requested within the time limit specified in Section 10.40.070, the chief of police shall cause the vehicle to be removed and taken to a junkyard, automobile dismantling yard, or refuse disposal site.

The chief of police shall send a request for payment of the costs to the owner of the property by regular mail, and if he does not pay the costs within thirty days after the date on which the letter was mailed, the procedure set forth in subsection C of Section 10.40.160 shall be followed. 
(Ord. 329 §2, 1975: Ord. 318 §10, 1974). 
10.40.090 - Request for hearing-Notice. 
    If a public hearing has been requested in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.40.070, a public hearing shall be held on the question of abatement and removal of a vehicle and the assessment of the administrative costs and cost of removal against the property on which it is located. The chief of police shall cause notices of the time and place of the hearing to be sent by regular mail to the owner of the land as shown on the last equalized county assessment roll, and to the last registered and legal owners of record of the vehicle unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership.

(Ord. 318 §11, 1974). 
10.40.100 - Hearing-Procedure. 
    The public hearing under this chapter shall be conducted by the chief of police. The chief of police shall hear all pertinent evidence offered by all interested persons, including testimony on the condition of the vehicle and the circumstances concerning its location on private property or public property. The technical rules of evidence shall not be applicable to the hearing. The owner of the land on which the vehicle is located may appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn written statement for consideration at the hearing. The owner of the land may deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his reasons for such denial. 
(Ord. 318 §12, 1974).

A.  At the conclusion of the public hearing, the chief of police may find that a vehicle has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public property and order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as provided in this chapter. He may also determine the amount of the administrative costs, in accordance with Sections 10.40.030 and 10.40.150, and may determine that all or a portion of the administrative costs and the cost of removal are to be charged against the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located. 
B.  If it is determined by the chief of police that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the landowner and that he has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the chief of police shall not assess administrative costs or the cost of removal of the vehicle against the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such landowner. 
C.  The chief of police may impose such conditions and take such other action as he deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purposes of this chapter. He may delay the time for removal of the vehicle if, in his opinion, the circumstances justify it. 
D.  The chief of police shall give written notice of his decision to all of the interested persons to whom the notice of hearing was mailed. 
(Ord. 329 §3, 1975: Ord. 318 §13, 1974).

B.  If no appeal has been filed and the vehicle has not been removed within ten days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, after the notice of the decision of the chief of police was mailed to the interested parties, the chief of police shall cause the vehicle to be removed and taken to a junkyard, automobile dismantling yard, or refuse disposal site.

(Ord. 318 §17, 1974). 
10.40.150 - Removal-Costs-Collection. 
A.  If the chief of police has caused the vehicle to be removed from the property, and he has assessed administrative costs and the cost of removal against the owner of the property on which the vehicle is located, he shall mail a notice to the owner of the property of the total costs to be paid by the owner of the property. 
B.

C.  If the costs referred to in subsections A and B of this section are not paid within thirty days after the date on which the notice referred to therein is mailed to the owner of the property, the city council may direct the county auditor to place the unpaid costs on the city tax roll as a special assessment against the property pursuant to Section 38773.5 of the Government Code of the state. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary city taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary city taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of city taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment. 
(Ord. 318 §18, 1974). 
10.40.160 - Costs-Payment by state. 
A.  The city council may, from time to time, enter into agreements with the state, through the California Highway Patrol, or such other agency of the state as shall be designated by the state, providing that the state shall pay all or any portion of the administrative costs. The city council may from time to time determine by resolution whether such payment agreed upon is sufficient to pay all or only a portion of the costs of administration. 
B.  Whenever the city has entered into an agreement with the county for the performance by the county of such acts as under this chapter may be delegated to the county, the county may contract with the state for the payment to the county of such administrative costs for the removal of vehicles removed within the city. In such case if the county makes a determination whether payments received from the state for removal of abandoned vehicles are sufficient to pay all or only a portion of the administrative cost, that determination shall apply also to payments of administrative costs of removal of vehicles within the city. 
C.  Except where administrative costs are determined by the chief of police at a hearing, the amount assessed against an owner of land pursuant to Sections 10.40.110 and 10.40.150 shall be limited to the portion of the administrative cost found to be not covered by such an agreement with the state and the cost of removal. This limitation on the assessment shall apply to all cases assessed while such a resolution is in effect. However, said limitation shall not apply to cases in which the written notice of intention to remove was mailed prior to the effective date of the resolution and the resolution increases the amount assessible. 
D.  Any cost of removal incurred shall be paid by the city out of its general fund. 
(Ord. 329 §4, 1975: Ord. 318 §18.5, 1974).

b.  Buildings owned and controlled by the city, used for public purposes and not for residential use (fire and police stations excepted).

E.  If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause, the council shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable. 
F.  If the council shall determine such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then the council may, by resolution, declare that the franchise of such grantee shall be terminated and forfeited unless there be compliance by the grantee within such period as the council may fix, or reduce the length of the franchise by a period of time up to the duration of the failure and/or violation.

In any case, and in any instance, all rights, remedies and redress which may or shall be available to the city, shall at all times be available to the city, and shall be preserved and maintained and shall continuously exist in and to the city, and shall not be in any manner or means modified, abridged, altered, restricted or impaired by agreement or otherwise. 
E.  Any franchise granted and accepted under this chapter shall be in lieu of any and all other rights, privileges, powers, immunities, and authorities owned, possessed, controlled or exercisable by the grantee, of or pertaining to the construction, operation, or maintenance of any cable television systems in the city.

C.  Any privilege claimed under any such franchise by the grantee in any street or other public property shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy to the streets or other public property. 
D.  Any such franchise shall be a privilege to be held in personal trust by the original grantee. It cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, without prior consent of the council expressed by resolution, and then only under such conditions as may therein be prescribed. Any such transfer or assignment shall be made only by an instrument in writing, such as a bill of sale, or similar document, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the city clerk within thirty days after any such transfer or assignment. The said consent of the council may not be unreasonably refused; provided, however, the proposed assignee must show responsibility as determined by the council utilizing the factors specified in Section 13.48.060(D), and must agree to comply with all provisions of this chapter; and provided, further, that no such consent shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, except that when such hypothecation shall exceed twenty-five percent of the market value of the property used by the franchisee in the conduct of the cable television system, prior consent of the council shall be required for such a transfer. Such consent shall not be withheld unreasonably. 
    In the event that grantee is a corporation, prior approval of the city council, expressed by resolution, shall be required where there is an actual change in control or where ownership of more than twenty-five percent of the voting stock of grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own fifty percent or more of the voting stock, singly or collectively. Any such acquisition occurring without prior approval of the city council shall constitute a failure to comply with a provision of this chapter within the meaning of Section 13.48.050 of this chapter. 
E.  Time shall be the of the essence of any such franchise granted hereunder. The grantee shall not be relieved of his obligation to comply promptly with any of the provisions of this chapter by any failure of the city to enforce prompt compliance. 
F.  Any right or power in, or duty impressed upon, any officer, employee, department; or board of the city shall be subject to transfer by the city to any other officer, employee, department, or board of the city. 
G.  The grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this chapter or of any franchise issued hereunder or because of its enforcement. 
H.  The grantee shall be subject to all requirements of city laws, rules, regulations, and specifications heretofore or hereafter enacted or established. 
I.  Any such franchise granted shall not relieve the grantee of any obligations involved in obtaining pole or conduit space from any department of the city, utility company, or from others maintaining utilities in streets. 
J.  Any franchise granted hereunder, shall be in lieu of any and all other rights, privileges, powers, immunities, and authorities owned, possessed, controlled, or exercisable by grantee, or any successor to any interest of grantee, of or pertaining to the construction, operation, or maintenance of any cable television system in the city, and the acceptance of any franchise hereunder shall operate, as between grantee and the city, as an abandonment of any and all of such rights, privileges, powers, immunities, and authorities within the city, to the effect that, as between grantee and the city, and all construction, operation and maintenance by any grantee of any cable television system in the city shall be, and shall be deemed and construed in all instances, and respects to be, under and pursuant to said franchise, and not hereunder or pursuant to any other right, privilege, power, immunity, or authority whatsoever. 
(Ord. 430 §1(part), 1980).

(Ord. 430 §1(part), 1980). 
13.48.110 - Council may adopt rules and regulations.

Nothing hereunder shall be deemed a taking of the property of grantee, and grantee shall be entitled to no surcharge by reason of anything hereunder. 
H.  Upon the failure, refusal, or neglect of grantee to cause any work or other act required by law or hereunder to be properly completed in, on, over, or under any street within any time prescribed therefor, or upon notice given, where no time is prescribed, the chief administrator may cause such work or other act to be completed in whole or in part, and upon so doing shall submit to grantee an itemized statement of the costs thereof. The grantee shall, within thirty days after receipt of such statement, pay to the city the entire amount thereof. 
I.  In the event that: 
1.  The use of any part of the system of grantee is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of thirty days, without prior written notice to and approval by the city; or 
2.  Any part of such system has been installed in any street or other area without complying with the requirements hereof; or

B.  The grantee shall prepare and furnish to the city administrator and the city clerk at the times and in the form prescribed by either of said officers, such reports with respect to its operations, affairs, transactions or property, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to the performance of any of the rights, functions or duties of the city of any of its officers in connection with the franchise.

    Upon the revocation of the franchise, or the expiration of the terms thereof, and upon payment by the grantor to the grantee of the fair market value of the grantee's CATV system, the grantor may purchase, acquire, takeover or hold said system. For purposes of this section, "fair market value" is determined by valuing the grantee's system as a going concern. No value shall be assigned to the franchise granted hereunder. Immediately upon a determination of revocation or expiration of the franchise, the grantor and grantee shall attempt to mutually agree upon the fair market value of the system. However, if within a reasonable period of time they cannot agree upon the fair market valuation, then said valuation shall be determined by a three member board of appraisers, one selected by the grantor, one selected by the grantee, and one selected by the appraisers themselves.

C.  In the event any portion of the unincorporated territory covered by an existing franchise or license granted by the county of Tulare is annexed to the city prior to the time that the grantee of such county franchise or license has commenced installation of a CATV system within said territory, all rights acquired by said grantee under its county franchise or license shall terminate by operation of law as of the date on which the annexation to the city becomes effective. 
D.  In the event any portion of unincorporated territory covered by an existing franchise or license granted by the county of Tulare is annexed to the city after the grantee thereof has commenced or completed construction and installation of CATV system within said territory, the rights reserved under such franchise or license to the county of Tulare or to any officer thereof, shall inure to the benefit of the city and all regulatory provisions of this chapter and any other rules and regulations applicable to CATV systems operating within the city, whether then in effect or subsequently adopted, shall be applicable to and binding upon said grantee. In addition, the grantee shall be obligated to pay annually to the city, the percentage of the gross receipts established by the county of Tulare in said franchise or license which are derived from its operation within the annexed territory for five years or upon termination of the franchise, whichever is of the shorter time duration, at which time the council may establish the percentage of gross receipts to be paid to the city.

D.  The grantee shall strictly adhere to all building and zoning codes currently or hereafter in force. The grantee shall arrange its lines, cables, and other appurtenances on both public and private property in such a manner as to cause no unreasonable interference with the use of said public or private property by any person.

13.48.230 - Special service areas. 
    As defined in the franchise agreement, the grantee shall be permitted to charge higher installation fees for areas of low housing density, commercial areas and/or underground utility areas that require exceptionally high construction costs. 
    Upon petition by the grantee, the council may defer or indefinitely suspend any expansion into such a special service area after a showing by grantee that such expansion would cause unreasonable financial hardship to grantee. The adequacy of such a showing shall be determined and weighed against the public interest in system expansion by the council after a public hearing. 
(Ord. 430 §1(part), 1980). 
13.48.240 - Receivership. 
A.  Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the CATV system, or upon the termination of any lease covering all or a substantial part of the CATV system, the grantee shall notify the city clerk of such fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of the grantee has taken place and the provisions of this chapter governing the consent of the council to such change in control of the grantee shall apply.

(Ord. 430 §1(part), 1980). 
13.48.260 - Continuity of service mandatory. 
    It shall be the right of all subscribers to receive all available services insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. In the event that the grantee elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify or sell the system, or the grantor revokes or fails to renew the franchise, the grantee shall do everything in its power to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances during the lifetime of the franchise. In the event of purchase by the grantor, or a change of grantee, the current grantee shall cooperate with the grantor to operate the system for a temporary period, in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers.

The owner or occupant shall comply with such notice within ten days from the date of service. On failure to comply with the notice, he is guilty of a violation of this chapter and subject to the penalty provided in Section 15.48.090. 
(Ord. 466 §1 (part), 1983). 
15.48.090 - Violations.

C.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the commission may reverse, modify, or affirm the findings of the environmental coordinator. Failure of the commission to take such action at the close of the hearing shall constitute a denial of the appeal unless action on the matter is continued to a later date. A modification of the action or finding appealed from shall constitute a denial of any portion not so modified or specifically affirmed. 
D.  A notice of the decision of the commission shall be filed with the notice of findings which had been previously filed in accordance with Section 18.08.060, and a copy of the notice of decision shall be mailed to the appellant at the address stated in his appeal.

17.08.01 Purpose
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65800 et. seq., the State of California grants to the
City of Exeter the power to apply zoning to lands within its city limits. The purpose of
zoning is to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. The constitutionality of
zoning has been upheld by the United States Supreme Court since 1926, Euclid v. Amber
Realty Company (272 US 365).
17.08.02 Definition
Zoning is the division of a city into districts, and the regulation within those districts of
the height, appearance and bulk of buildings and structures; the area of a lot that may be
occupied and the size of required open spaces; the density and intensity of development;
and the use of buildings and land for commercial, agricultural, industrial, residential and
other purposes.

17.08.04 Overlay Districts
Overlay districts are areas in Exeter that may require special regulations due to unique
locational features, architecture, historical significance, resources or hazards. These
districts may be combined with any of the base districts identified in this Chapter. For
purposes of identification on the Official Zoning Map for Exeter, districts that are joined
with an overlay district shall be suffixed with the name of the overlay district. As an
example, the zoning for an area of Exeter that is classified central commercial (CC) and
contains the historic downtown, which demands unique design regulations, would read as
CC-DD, central commercial, downtown design district. Exeter overlay districts are as
follows:
PD Planned Development
DD Downtown Design
HN Historic Neighborhood
17.08.05 Official Zoning Map
The zoning boundaries of the aforementioned districts and overlay districts shall be
shown on the Official Zoning Map of Exeter. The Official Zoning Map shall be a part of
this Ordinance and shall remain on file with the Exeter Planning and Building
Department and displayed on the City of Exeters website.
The Exeter Planning and Building Department shall be responsible for amending the
Official Zoning Map when land is annexed into the city or when property is reclassified
from one zone to another.
17.08.06 District Boundaries
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundary of any district shown on the Zoning Map, the
following rules shall apply.
A. District boundaries shall coincide with either streets, alleys, property lines or
railroad rights-of-way unless otherwise shown on the Zoning Map.
B. Where doubt exists as to the location of a district boundary within a block, the
boundary line shall be the nearest interior lot line existing at the effective date of
this Ordinance (Ordinance 246, 1965).

altered or enlarged, nor shall any site or structure be used in a manner other than is
included among the uses hereinafter listed as permitted or conditionally permitted in the
district in which the structure or site is located. In addition, no structure or part thereof
shall be erected, reconstructed, enlarged or moved into any district that exceeds the
development standards for the district in which the structure is located.
17.08.08 Effect of Annexation, Vacation or Abandonment on District
Boundaries
Where property is annexed into Exeter or where property is vacated or abandoned, the
following zoning rules shall apply:
A. Exeter may pre-zone unincorporated territory adjoining the city for the purpose of
determining the zoning that will apply to such territory in the event of annexation.
Zoning of the subject territory will be conducted consistent with Chapter 17.48
Zoning Ordinance Amendments and will become effective when annexation has
been completed.
B. Unless pre-zoned, all property annexed into the City shall be classified to the
Urban Reserve (UR) district.
C. All property that lacks zoning because property has been vacated or abandoned
shall be zoned to the centerline of the subject property consistent with the zoning
on the adjoining property.
17.08.09 Effect on Other Regulations
Where more restrictive standards, use regulations or rules are established by any other
applicable statutes, ordinances or regulations than is established by this Ordinance, the
provisions of such statutes, ordinances or regulations shall govern.

7. Stairways should be designed as an integral part of the overall multifamily
development. Materials used on the building should be
incorporated into the stairway design. Stairways should not be a dominant
exterior feature on the building but should be sited so that they are not
visually prominent.
Figure 18-3: Stairways
8. The maximum height for multi-family developments shall be two (2)
stories.
C. Parking lots and driveways should be designed to blend in with the overall multifamily

17.42.01 Purpose
The purpose of the planned development (PD-X) overlay district is to promote
development designs that respond to significant planning-related issues facing Valley
cities, including urbanization of agricultural land, air quality, housing affordability,
traffic, aesthetics and neighborhood deterioration. This new approach to development
design has been popularized by the term smart growth. The basis for this type of
growth is revealed in the following documents: Ahwanee Principles, Landscaping of
Choice and Ten Planning Principles for the Next 10 Million.
The planned development overlay district is structured to produce a comprehensive
development that is superior to traditional development of the recent past. In addition to
better design strategies, a development constructed in an overlay zone will have less of an
impact on the environment and will be consist with recent State legislation - AB 32 and
SB 375, which attempts to curb the impacts of climate change.

A. New Buildings and Renovation of Existing Buildings
1. Building scale should be compatible with the adjoining buildings. Scale
refers to the size and proportions of buildings as they relate to people. The
material used can affect the scale of the building. For example, horizontal
lines on a tall building will cause it to appear shorter. It can also be
affected by the pattern and shape of the windows and door openings.
New buildings should be designed to be compatible in design with adjoining buildings
2. Proportions of building - the relationship between the width and height of
a building should be compatible with buildings in the immediate vicinity.
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 46: DD-X Zone (Downtown Design Overlay)
46-6
3. Relationships of materials, textures and color should be compatible with
the surrounding buildings and its own architecture style.
Relationships of materials, textures and colors should be compatible with surrounding buildings.
4. Careful consideration shall be given to rhythm and pattern of openings,
size of windowpanes, and the space of openings.
5. New building design that is consistent with the informal, historical
character of the community, should be encouraged.
6. Preservation and restoration of existing historic building facades should be
encouraged.
Preservation and restoration of existing historic building facades should be encouraged.
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 46: DD-X Zone (Downtown Design Overlay)
46-7
7. Buildings should be designed with well-defined front and back areas,
entries and separation of private, semi-public and public spaces.
8. Although architectural details, embellishments and projections are
desirable, they should be used judiciously. Avoid designs that are
overstated or create an indiscriminate mixing of stylistic elements.
9. Design compatibility and interest can be achieved with the tasteful
organization of building elements, colors, and materials.
Design compatibility and interest can be achieved with the tasteful organization of
building elements, colors, and materials
10. Encourage arcades in front of buildings where appropriate to the
architecture.
B. Building Placement and Facade Elements
1. Divide large expanses of storefront glazing with vertical framing elements.
Within these framing elements glass may be large plates, divided with true
mullions or a combination of both.
2. Do not use curtain wall glazing systems or snap-in grilles on lower or
upper floor areas.
3. Use simple awning shapes and profiles that reflect the facade composition
and geometry of the building. Set individual awning between the vertical
elements of the ground floor storefront such as piers, pilasters, shop
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 46: DD-X Zone (Downtown Design Overlay)
46-8
divisions, second floor entries and the like. Allow some continuous
awnings, where appropriate.
Use simple awning shapes and profiles that reflect the facade composition and geometry
of the building.
4. Do not obscure architectural elements with careless placement of awnings.
Use awnings on second floors only at individual window openings.
5. Awnings are encouraged and allowed to project into the pedestrian rightof-
way.
6. Awnings may be retractable or fixed frames, constructed of metal with
fabric coverings. Glossy, plasticized or vinyl finishes are inappropriate for
coverings.
C. Appropriate Materials
1. Use materials for the principal wall surface of the building facade, which
have a durable, high quality, finish and are compatible with the existing
historic brick buildings.
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 46: DD-X Zone (Downtown Design Overlay)
46-9
Use materials for the principal wall surface of the building facade, which has a durable,
high quality, finish and are compatible with the existing historic brick buildings.
2. Examples of inappropriate principle material and finishes for wall surfaces
include the following: imitation or processed materials, lava rock,
permastone, and grooved plywood.
3. Secondary or accent facade materials should be compatible with principal
facade materials and with those traditionally used on downtown
commercial buildings. If brick is not used as the primary material, it is
preferred as a secondary or accent material.
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 46: DD-X Zone (Downtown Design Overlay)
46-10
Secondary or accent facade materials should be compatible with principal facade
materials.
4. Roofing materials and finishes should be appropriate to the type, form and
style of the building.

quality appropriate for commercial as opposed to residential applications.
Appropriate storefront materials should include the following.
a. Clear or lightly tinted glass in painted wood frames or factoryfinished

northern side of Pine Street. White and very bright colors are
highly reflective and can be uncomfortable to look at on sunny or
bright days.
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 46: DD-X Zone (Downtown Design Overlay)
46-11
c. Avoid an overwhelming contrast in color values between facade
and trim colors and the existing colors on adjacent building.
Garish or super bright (neon-type) colors or metallic paint finishes
are generally inappropriate for any building element.
d. The applicant shall provide a color board showing all the colors
that will be used on the building facade.
D. Historic Restoration
1. Locate building additions to the rear of the existing structure whenever
possible in order to maintain visual integrity.

back from the street and well behind the line of the original facade so that
it maintains its visual integrity and original sense of scale.
3. Additions to buildings with historic designations should be identifiable
from original construction. They should clearly distinguish old from new
to avoid confusing original historical building elements with later
additions. Specific architectural elements should not be replicated.
4. Additions should employ the same or complementing materials, and
similar opening proportions, facade rhythms and horizontal elements as
original.
5. Locate building additions to the rear of the existing structure whenever
possible in order to maintain visual integrity.
6. Use authentic materials whenever possible in restoration, renovation or
repair work.
7. For substitute materials, the outward appearance, durability, texture and
finish should be as close as possible to that of the original. If the original
was painted, the substitute should accept and retail a painted finish.
8. Wood window sash is preferred for historic buildings. Vinyl clad wood or
factory finish (baked enamel) aluminum frames are acceptable if the
original design can be duplicated.
9. Materials, paint colors and color schemes should be appropriate to the
style and design intent of the building.
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 46: DD-X Zone (Downtown Design Overlay)
46-12
10. Sandblasting of brick/masonry surfaces to remove paint will damage the
material. Other methods should be used only under the advice and
guidance of an expert.
11. Do not cover over, clad or replace original siding material with a different
material such as stucco, wood or composition shingles, aluminum siding,
and the like.
12. Where the original materials have been covered over, use the gentlest
means possible to remove them. Certain claddings, such as stucco may be
difficult, if not impossible to remove without destroying the underlying
material.
13. Where inappropriate or later materials have been removed, they should be
replaced with the authentic materials matching the original.
14. When re-roofing, use the original or similar materials (if available and in
compliance with current codes).

etc. Replacements should be similar in character to the original.
Replacement materials on historic buildings should be similar in character to the original.
16. Maintain the proportions of existing door and window openings and the
pattern of existing window sash in replacement work or additions.
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 46: DD-X Zone (Downtown Design Overlay)
46-13

(routed, painted or sealed), wood or metal panels, individually mounted
letters, vinyl letters or cast metal plaques. Materials must be compatible
with the building design or architecture.
6. Illumination shall be by indirect means such as concealed or
inconspicuous spotlights or backlighting. Signs should not flash,
scintillate, move or produce glare.
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 46: DD-X Zone (Downtown Design Overlay)
46-14
7. Background illumination by means of decorative or concealed lighting is
encouraged. This may include vintage wall sconces at windows, cornices,

46-17
winter rainy season. In addition, permanent canopies provide visual
interest and complexity, reducing the scale of building massing and can
help identify entries to buildings.
15. Entries should be spatially defined with canopies, awnings and other
elements that help to identify them from pedestrian ways. Entries can be
defined with building insets that provide a transition between the public
walkways and the more private, commercial interiors of buildings. Entries
should be adequately lit at all times to eliminate dark, unsafe areas.

The lack of certainty in the approval of development projects can result in the waste of
resources, escalate the cost of housing and other development to the consumer, and
discourage investment in and commitment to comprehensive planning which would make
maximum efficient utilization of resources at the least economic cost to the public. A
development agreement assures the applicant of a development project that existing
policies, rules and regulations, and conditions of approval remain in place once the
project has been approved.
17.56.02 Authority

17.58.11 Density Bonus Calculations
17.58.01 Purpose
The purpose of a density bonus is to encourage the private sector to construct affordable
housing for target households as defined by the Government Code. A density bonus
can be approved by Exeter if a private sector housing developer agrees to construct a
certain percentage of units for target households and agrees to maintain their affordability
for a specific time period.
Section 65915 of the State Government Code states that when an applicant seeks a
density bonus for a housing development in Exeter, the City shall provide the applicant
incentives or concessions for the production of housing units and child care facilities.
17.58.02 Definitions
A. Density Bonus: A density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable
residential density under the applicable zoning ordinance and the land use element
C H A P T E R 58
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 58: Density Bonuses

of the general plan as of the date of application. Density bonus percentages may
range from five to 35 percent depending upon the percentage of low-income, very
low-income or moderate-income housing units proposed for construction a
housing developer.
B. Developer Incentives:
1. Reduce or eliminate standards contained in the subdivision ordinance or
Exeters Improvements Manual.
2. Reduce or eliminate residential zone district requirements, including open
space, lot size, setbacks, or parking standards.
3. Reduce or eliminate any design requirements exceeding Uniform Building
code specification.
C. Housing Development: One or more residential projects that have five or more
residential units.
D. Low Income Household: A unit affordable to a household at a rent that does not
exceed 80 percent of the Tulare County median household income.
E. Very Low Income Household: A unit affordable to a household at a rent that does
not exceed 50 percent of the Tulare County median household income.
F. Extremely Low Income Household: A units affordable to a household at a rent
that does not exceed 30 percent of the Tulare County median household income.
G. Target Households: Lower-income households or senior citizen households.
H. Senior Households: Those residential units that have at least one occupant that is
at least 55 years of age or older.
17.58.03 Application and Fees
An application for a density bonus shall be made to the Planning Department on a form
prescribed by the Department. A fee set by resolution of the City Council shall
accompany the application.
17.58.04 Density Bonus Requirements
Government Code Section 65915 indicates that when an applicant seeks a density bonus
for a housing development, the density bonus requirements are triggered when the
residential development sets aside at least 10 percent of the total units as affordable to
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 58: Density Bonuses
58-3
low-income households; or at least 5 percent of the total units as affordable to very lowincome
households; or at least 10 percent of the total units as affordable for moderateincome
households.
Development concessions or incentives that may be provided by the City of Exeter
include a reduction in site development standards; a modification of zoning code
requirements (including a reduction in setbacks, square footage requirements, or parking
spaces; or architectural design requirements which exceed the minimum building
standards); approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if
commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing
development, and if such nonresidential uses are compatible with the project; or other
regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the city of Exeter
which result in identifiable cost reductions.
A project that receives a density bonus and concession or incentive must retain
affordability of the units for at least 30 years.
17.58.05 Density Bonus Requirements for Land Donations
If an applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or some other type of
residential development application donates land to Exeter where very-low income
housing can be developed, the developer shall be entitled to a minimum of 15 percent
increase above the allowable residential density under the zoning ordinance and land use
element of the general plan.
17.58.06 Application
An application for a density bonus shall be made to the Planning Department on a form
prescribed by the Department. A fee set by resolution of the City Council shall
accompany the application.
17.58.07 Report and Findings
The Planning Department shall prepare a report on the density bonus application. The

58-4
17.58.08 Action of Planning Commission
Following the Planning Commissions review of the Planning Departments report on the
applicants request for a density bonus, the Commission shall take action on the density
bonus application based on the regulations contained in Government Code Sections
65915 to 65918. The Commission can approve, approve with conditions, or deny the
density bonus. Denial of a density bonus application shall require findings consistent
with those in Government Code Sections 65915 to 65918.
The Commissions recommendation shall be forwarded to the City Council.
If the Commission approves the density bonus and the developer provides an instrument
that will insure that target households will remain affordable for 30 years or longer, the
Commission may grant a developer incentive. If the Commission finds that a developer
incentive is not necessary to insure the affordability of target households, it shall make
a written finding that the incentive or concession is not necessary.
The Commissions decision shall not be based on a finding that target households will
occupy the housing project and that this condition may have an adverse impact on the
neighborhood or community.
Within 10 days of adopting a resolution on the density bonus, the Planning Department
shall forward the Commissions recommendation to the City Council and shall transmit a
copy of the Commissions resolution to the applicant.
17.58.09 Action of the City Council
The City Council shall consider the Planning Commissions recommendation and shall
take action on the density bonus application. The Council can approve, approve with
modifications, or deny the density bonus application. One of the following actions shall
be initiated:
A. If the City Council approves or approves with modification an ordinance on the
density bonus application, the Council shall initiate proceedings to adopt a second
reading of the ordinance.
B. Any modification of the proposed density bonus by the City Council that is based
on information not considered by the Planning Commission shall cause the
density bonus application to be referred back to the Commission for its
reevaluation and recommendation.

17.58.11 Density Bonus Calculations
The base density of a property for which a density bonus is being requested shall be
determined by the propertys zoning. A housing development may qualify for a
minimum increase or density bonus of 35 percent over the maximum number of
permitted residential units of the propertys zoning.

J. Location Criteria
Parking lots shall be located on the same property as the building they serve, except that
parking for buildings in the Central Commercial (CC) district may be located within 300
feet of the subject property. In the CC district, parking lots shall be located at the rear or
side of the subject building. Parking lots shall not be located on the corner where two
streets intersect.
K. Shared Parking
Where two or more non-residential uses share a single parking lot, the number of
required parking spaces may be reduced by a maximum of 20 percent, as long as the total
number of spaces is not less than the required for the use requiring the largest number of
spaces.
Where non-residential uses share a single parking lot and it can be demonstrated that the
uses operate at different times of the day (an evening use versus a day-time use), the
required number of parking spaces may be reduced by up to 50 percent of the combined
parking requirements of the two uses.
L. Parking Standard Modifications
Parking space requirements may be modified through Exeters minor deviation process.
The Planning Director may approve a reduction of up to 20 percent in a projects required
parking spaces if the following findings can be made:
1. That the granting of the minor deviation will not create a safety hazard or lead to a
condition where the loading of public vehicles onto public streets will interfere
with the free flow of traffic on these streets.
2. That the granting of the minor deviation will not create a safety hazard of any
other condition inconsistent with the objectives of the Zoning Ordinance.
M. Handicapped Parking Spaces
Handicapped parking stalls shall be provided per the Uniform Building Code.
Handicapped parking stalls shall be designed consistent with the illustrations shown in
Exhibit 68-2.
N. Loading Facilities
1. Commercial, industrial, office, institutional, and public uses exceeding 10,000
square feet in size shall be required to install an off-street loading facility unless
Exeter Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 68: Parking and Loading
68-12
the Planning Director finds that due to the operational nature of the use, none or
more than one off-street loading space should be required.
2. To the extent possible, loading facilities should be located at the rear or side of the
building that they are to serve.
3. Streets and alleys shall not be used as loading or unloading areas, nor shall trucks
use streets and alleys for maneuvering trailers into a loading space.
4. Loading facilities, at a minimum, shall have a length of 25 feet, a width of 12 feet,
and an overhead clearance of 14 feet. All loading surfaces shall be paved
consistent with Exeters Improvements Manual.
5. Where a loading facility is near or adjacent to a residential district or other noisesensitive
land uses, noise attenuating design measures will be incorporated into
the project. These design measures could include increased setback distances, the
construction of a 7-foot solid block wall, landscaping or locating the loading
facilities away from noise-sensitive land uses.
6. All loading facilities shall be lighted to provide adequate illumination of the
loading area for safety and security reasons. Where a loading area is near or
adjacent to a residential district or other light-sensitive uses, the lighting shall be
directed away from these uses.

17.69.01 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for regulating signs, including the
type, size, and location and construction standards of signs by zone district. Signs have
an obvious impact on the character and quality of the city. As a prominent part of the
visual environment, they attract or repel the viewing public, affect the safety of vehicular
traffic and their suitability or appropriateness helps to set the tone of the neighborhood.
The objectives of this chapter include the following:
A. To reinforce that the sign should serve primarily to identify the general nature of
an establishment or to direct attention to a project, activity, place, person,
organization, or enterprise.
B. As identification devices, signs must not subject the citizens of the Exeter to
excessive competition for their visual attention. As appropriate identification
devices, signs must harmonize with the building, the neighborhood, and other
signs in the area.

harmonious with the colors, materials and architecture of the building and the
immediate vicinity. Freestanding signs shall be finished with the same or
compatible materials as the building on the site.
B. Size: Notwithstanding applicable sign standards elsewhere in this chapter, sign
size shall be proportionate to the size and scale of the site and building upon
which the sign is proposed. Sign dimensions as specified in this chapter are
maximum allowable dimensions; it may be necessary that signs be smaller than
the maximum allowed in order to be proportionate in size and scale to achieve the
design objectives of this section.

dark sign background is preferred with light colored copy (characters/graphics).
E. Logos and Trademarks: this section shall not prohibit the use of established
corporate colors or logos. When established corporate colors are incompatible
with buildings colors, compatibility in design with the surrounding development
should be accomplished through the use of appropriate background colors or other
design features.
F. Lighting Intensity: The light emitted or reflected by a sign, or emitted by a light
source, shall be of reasonable intensity and shall be compatible with the
architecture of the building and the immediate vicinity. Artificial light sources
shall be shielded to prevent light spillage, glare or annoyance to persons on or
inside adjoining properties or to public or private rights-of-way.
G. Sign Bases and Frames: Freestanding signs shall be either housed in a frame, or
set onto a base, presenting a solid, attractive, and well-proportioned appearance.
The size and shape of the frame or base shall be proportionate to the size and
mass of the sign and should be low-profile in design. Pole type signs are not
permitted. Guy wires, angle irons, braces and other support or construction
elements shall be screened or hidden from view.
H. Landscaping: Freestanding signs shall be located in a landscaped area
proportionate to the size of the sign, but not less than twice the size of one side of
the sign face. Appropriate accent landscaping should be placed at the base of the
