CAMARILLO - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Camarillo, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 10, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
> 
PREFACE 
The Camarillo Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1977, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 10, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1160, passed January 9, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 10, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 10, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 10, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 10, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission.

If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

Article V. - Collection of Unpaid Fines and Penalties* 
* Prior ordinance history: Ord. 968. 
 
1.13.220 - Collection of administrative citation fines and costs. 
The failure of any person to pay a fine or penalty assessed by administrative citation within the time specified on the citation constitutes a debt to the city. To enforce that debt, the city may file a civil action, lien and/or place a special assessment on the subject property, or pursue any other legal remedy to collect such debt. A person who fails to pay any fine or other charge owed to the city under this chapter is liable in any action brought by the city for all costs incurred in securing payment of the delinquent amount, including administrative costs and attorneys' fees. Such collection costs are in addition to any applicable fines, interest, and late charges. 
(Ord. 1017 § 2 (part), 2007.)  
1.13.230 - Lien and assessment procedures. 
In addition to any other legal remedy, the city may place a lien and/or assessment on property that is the subject of a citation if the citation has been issued to the property owner. The following procedures will apply: 
A.  The city manager may initiate proceedings to record a lien and/or place an assessment against the subject property. 
B.  Before recording the lien or assessing the property, the city manager must cause a report to be submitted to the city clerk stating the amounts due and owing. The report may include an administrative fee, as established by city council resolution, for the administrative costs associated with the processing and recordation of the proposed lien. 
C.  The city clerk must fix a time, date, and place for a hearing before the city manager to consider the report and any protests or objections to the report. 
D.  The city clerk must serve the property owner with a hearing notice not less than ten days before the hearing date. The notice must set forth the amount of the delinquent administrative fine, and any penalties and interest that is due. Notice must be sent by first-class and certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the property owner's address as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll or supplemental roll of the County of Ventura, whichever is more current. Service by mail is effective on the date of mailing and failure of property owner to actually receive notice does not affect its validity. 
E.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the city manager must adopt a report confirming, discharging, or modifying the delinquent amount. The decision of the city manager will be final. Following the adoption of the report, the city clerk may cause the lien to be filed in the county recorder's office. 
F.  Prior to recordation of the lien and/or placement of an assessment against the property owner's parcel, the city clerk must give ten day's notice to the property owner, by first-class and certified mail, addressed to the property owner's address as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll or supplemental roll of the County of Ventura, whichever is more current. If the owner of record, after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy of the proposed lien or assessment in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days and by publishing notice of the lien or assessment in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in the manner provided by Government Code Section 6062. 
G.  If the city intends to make the delinquent amount an assessment against the subject property, the notice must specify that the property may be sold after three years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. 
H.  Upon recordation, the lien will have the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and may be foreclosed by judicial or other sale in the manner and means provided by law. 
I.  In addition to, or as an alternative to recordation of the lien, the city may collect the amount owed as a special assessment against the property owner's parcel. To do so, the city must present a copy of the lien to the county auditor controller to add the amount of the lien to the next regular property tax bill levied against the parcel for municipal purposes. This amount will be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary property taxes are collected, and will be subject to the same penalties and procedures under foreclosure and sale as provided for with ordinary municipal taxes. 
(Ord. 1017 § 2 (part), 2007.)  
1.13.240 - Satisfaction of lien. 
Once the city receives full payment for the outstanding principal, penalties, and costs related to a recorded lien, the city clerk will cause to be recorded a notice of satisfaction at the county recorder's office. This notice of satisfaction will cancel the city's lien. 
(Ord. 1017 § 2 (part), 2007.)  
Chapter 1.14 - APPEALS 
 
1.14.010 - Reimbursement of fees on certain appeals.

E.  "Rent" means the consideration charged by an operator, whether or not received, for the occupancy or right to occupy space in the hotel according to the then effective schedule of rates for such room or rooms on the date or dates of such occupancy, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash credits, property and services of any kind or nature, included in the price of the room, without any deduction or offset therefrom whatsoever.

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of nine percent of the rent charged by the operator.

The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.

No operator shall advertise that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator or that the tax will not be added to the rent or that, if added, any part of the tax will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the operator from paying the tax on behalf of the transient. 
(Ord. 953 § 3, 2002: Ord. 877 § 2 (part), 1997: Ord. 12 § 1 (part), 1965: prior code § 6204.)

Any such rules and regulations which may affect the amount of the tax or tax owed are subject to city council approval. The tax administrator shall file and maintain such rules and regulations. The burden to secure and comply with the rules and regulations shall be upon the operator. 
(Ord. 953 § 4, 2002)  
3.16.070 - Reporting and remitting. 
A.  On or before the fifteenth day of the month following the close of each calendar month, each operator shall mail a return postmarked by the fifteenth of the month with the tax administrator, on forms provided by the tax administrator, stating the total rent and the amount of tax due for the preceding month. At the time the return is mailed, the full amount of the tax due shall be remitted to the Tax administrator. Taxes are deemed paid upon the tax administrator receiving a tax return and tax payment and, if applicable, exemption forms. The tax administrator may require additional information to be included in returns. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
B.  Information filed with the city to comply with this chapter including, without limitation, amounts of gross receipts, adjustments, credits, overcollections, tax, penalty and interest, is confidential to the extent provided by California law. This section does not apply to disclosures made during the course of any administrative, criminal, or civil proceeding to enforce the provisions of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter prevents the city from disclosing statistical or cumulative information derived from tax returns where the identity of taxpayers is protected. 
C.  Should an operator fail to pay, or if the city finds that additional taxes are due, the tax administrator may order the operator to furnish additional information or provide adequate security as necessary to ensure collection of any taxes due or to become due, and to remit taxes an a daily or weekly basis. The operator shall thereafter report and remit all taxes due under the terms and conditions prescribed by the tax administrator. The tax administrator may amend or rescind such an order upon the operator's full compliance with this code. 
(Ord. 953 § 6, 2002: Ord. 877 § 2 (part), 1997: Ord. 12 § 1 (part), 1965: prior code § 6206.)

A.  Action by tax administrator. If any operator fails or refuses to collect and/or remit the tax due to the city and/or fails or refuses to file, within the time provided in this chapter any required report or return with the city, then the tax administrator shall investigate in an appropriate manner to determine an estimate of the tax due. The tax administrator shall make an estimate of all taxes due pursuant to this chapter and shall issue an order for the payment of tax ("order") determining and assessing against such operator the full amount of the taxes, including interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. The order shall briefly describe the basis for the estimate of taxes due. The tax administrator shall serve a copy of the order by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator at the operator's last known address. Within ten consecutive calendar days after the service of such order, the operator may file a written request for administrative review with the tax administrator. The tax administrator shall review the matters in the written request and render a decision within thirty days. If relief is denied, within ten consecutive calendar days, the operator may file an appeal in writing with city manager requesting a hearing on the order. The request for an appeal must be accompanied by an administrative fee in an amount determined by the city council resolution. If an appeal by an operator for a hearing is not made within the said ten-day period, the order shall be deemed, for all purposes, final and conclusive and all sums set forth therein shall be immediately due and payable. 
B.  Appeals. Upon receipt of a timely filed appeal, the city manager shall give not less than five days written notice to the operator and to any person requesting such notice, of the time and place of the appeal hearing, which shall be set by the city manager. At such hearing, the operator and any interested person may appear and offer relevant evidence as to why the tax, interest and penalties should not be imposed as set forth in the order. Based upon the evidence presented at that hearing, the city manager shall determine the total amount of tax due, together with interest and penalties, if any. The city manager shall affirm or modify the order based upon the evidence presented. The city manager shall serve a copy of the written decision upon the operator and any other person requesting the same. The city manager's action on an order shall be deemed final and conclusive and all sums set forth therein shall be immediately due and payable. The written notice of decision shall provide that an action may be filed with the Superior Court of the state pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5 by filing said action within ninety days following the date of the city manager's written notice.

If the operator has notice of an impending or ongoing audit, then the operator shall keep the required records for the time period specified in the notice until the audit has been completed and all obligations under this section are paid in full; however, under no circumstances shall the records be maintained for less than five years from the date the record was created. 
An operator may apply to the tax administrator for modification of the recordkeeping requirements of this section if the operator demonstrates that the operator has an alternate recordkeeping system which provides proper safeguards to ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter. However, the tax administrator shall not extend the length of time specified in this section that records shall be required to be kept. The decision of the tax administrator may be appealed to the city manager. The decision of the city manager shall be final and conclusive for all matters.

All such claims shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.

An operator may claim a refund for, or receive as a credit against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when the tax administrator reasonably determines such to be the case, provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently paid by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax and paid the same to the city. 
D.  An operator may claim a refund for, or receive as a credit against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid by the operator based on the operator's clerical or computation error. The operator shall not be entitled to such a refund or credit until the operator has established the existence of such clerical or computation error to the satisfaction of the tax administrator. 
E.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing such entitlement.

A.  Tax as Civil Debt. Any tax required to be paid pursuant to this chapter: 
1.  Which is collected by an operator and has not been paid to the city in the time prescribed by this chapter, shall be deemed to be a civil debt owed by the operator to the city; and 
2.  By a transient, which tax is not collected for any reason by the operator whether or not rent is collected by such operator from such transient, the amount of such tax shall be deemed to be a civil debt owed by the operator and the transient to the city.

1.  If a civil action is required to enforce the collection of a tax from any person, and a recovery of such tax in any amount is granted in such a civil judicial proceeding, the city shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, and its costs of the administrative process under this chapter, including, but not limited to other direct and indirect costs incurred by the city with reference to such litigation. 
2.  Recording of a Certificate of Lien. If any tax is not paid when due, the tax administrator may record in the office(s) of county recorder(s) of such counties as the tax administrator may determine, a certificate which specifies the amount of tax due and the name and address of the operator owing the tax. The certificate shall include a statement that the tax administrator has complied with all legal requirements in the determination of the tax owed and a legal description of the real property of the owner. Upon recording of the certificate, the tax constitutes a lien upon all real property owned or thereafter acquired by the operator. The lien has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien.

3.16.123 - Duty and liability of operator's successor. 
A.  Any operator liable for any tax who sells or otherwise disposes of a hotel, and the operator's successor, shall notify the tax administrator of the date of sale at least thirty days prior to the date of the sale or immediately if the agreement to sell or otherwise dispose of the hotel was made less than thirty days prior to the date of the sale. The successor shall withhold from the operator in trust for the city a portion of the purchase price sufficient to pay the amount of the tax owed to the city until the operator secures a written tax clearance notification from the tax administrator stating that no tax is due from the operator through the date of the sale. If no tax clearance notification is presented by the operator to the successor within thirty days after the successor commences operation of the hotel, the successor shall immediately deposit with the tax administrator the amount withheld from the purchase price to be applied to the amount of the tax owed by the prior operator. 
B.  If the successor fails to withhold the amount required by this chapter, the successor is liable to the city for payment of the tax owed by the operator. 
C.  The tax administrator shall, within thirty days of receipt of a written request for a tax clearance notification, either issue the notification or give written notice to the operator, with a copy to the successor, of the amount of tax which must be paid to secure issuance of the tax clearance notification. The tax clearance notification shall be a defense, available solely to the successor and not the operator, to any claim the city may assert against the successor for taxes owed by the operator. 
D.  Any operator from which the successor has withheld and paid to the city a portion of the purchase price may challenge the city's determination pursuant to Section 3.16.080, by making application in writing for a hearing on the amount determined by the city within ten days of mailing by the tax administrator. Following receipt of a timely request for hearing, the hearing provisions of Section 3.16.080 shall apply.

B.  If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties referred to in Subsection A of this Section, 3.16.130. 
C.  Every penalty imposed upon a tax levied pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed for the purpose of collection merged in the tax to which it relates and the full amount thereof shall be due, payable and subject to collection as provided in this chapter.

3.16.140 - Statement of tax not conclusive on city.

Each report or statement and each of the items therein are subject to audit and verification by an auditor appointed by the city. 
B.  The tax administrator may require any operator, upon reasonable written notice, to provide the tax administrator with access to all of the operator's books and records relating to the operator's operation of the hotel, including rents charged by such operator which are subject to a tax pursuant to this chapter. If, as a result of any such audit, it is determined that a return required to be filed by such operator pursuant to Section 3.16.070 hereof is inaccurate and did not include and report the correct amount of tax due pursuant to this chapter, the operator shall forthwith pay to the city all taxes which are shown to be due as a result of such audit, regardless of whether the operator collected such taxes. 
C.  Every operator shall keep and preserve for a period of not less than five years all records as may be necessary to determine the tax, which records shall be made available upon demand of the city at all reasonable times. Such operator shall permit an examination of such books and records at a location within the city's jurisdiction. 
D.  If an audit conducted pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.16.140 reflects that in any calendar month there was under-reporting of taxes due by five percent or more, which under-reporting was not corrected by the operator prior to the commencement of the audit, all costs associated with the audit shall be borne by the operator and the cost thereof shall be subject to collection as a civil debt by the city. 
(Ord. 953 § 12, 2002: Ord. 814 § 5, 1994.)  
3.16.150 - Service charges.

If the operator determines that a transient is exempt from the payment of the tax pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the operator shall file a copy of each claim under Section 3.16.040(C) with the tax administrator not later than the date upon which the next return required by this chapter is required to be filed with the tax administrator. 
B.  Claims for exemptions shall be made on forms provided for that purpose by the tax administrator. All information required on the form shall be completed by the person who claims to be exempt from payment of the tax. Each operator is obligated to review each claim to ensure that it is fully completed. When an operator submits to the tax administrator a claim of exemption which is either not timely filed or is incomplete, the tax administrator shall reject such claim of exemption and give the operator a brief statement of reasons therefor. When the rejection is based upon the form not being properly completed, the operator may within ten consecutive calendar days from the date of return of the rejected claim for exemption refile the same with all information required to be placed thereon included in the refiled claim. 
C.  When a claim of exemption is defective, the operator: 
1.  Shall be responsible for all taxes due with respect to the purported exempt transient; and 
2.  Shall pay to the city a service charge of five dollars ("service charge") for each claim of exemption which is rejected by the tax administrator as incomplete or inappropriate; and 
3.  The tax administrator shall give notice to the operator of all taxes due as a result of rejection of the exemption claims and the amount of service charges imposed. The operator shall pay all sums due within ten working days of notification. 
D.  The amount of the service charge shall be increased on or after January 1st of each year in an amount equal to the increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County) during the preceding calendar year. For the purpose of this chapter, service charges imposed shall be deemed for all purposes to have merged into the tax due, and shall be subject to collection in the time and manner as set forth in this chapter. 
E.  If an operator consistently files claim forms which are either not timely filed, or are incomplete, the tax administrator may require the operator to place a cash deposit in an amount not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars with the tax administrator for the purpose of ensuring that taxes due and service charges imposed as a result of defective claims for exemption are timely paid. If such a deposit is required, the operator shall maintain the deposit in an amount not less than that set by the tax administrator.

B.  The review conducted by the city manager, or designee, will include consideration of whether to establish a payment plan for the customer to pay any unpaid balance of delinquent account over a reasonable time not to exceed twelve months. Unless otherwise required by this code, the city will not terminate service for customer fully complying with such a payment plan. 
C.  If a customer fails to comply with a payment plan established pursuant to this section, the city shall give the customer a two business days' notice to comply in order to avoid termination of service. Such notice does not entitle the customer to further investigation or review by the city. 
D.  Water bills shall contain information regarding dispute resolution procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. 958 § 6, 2002.)  
3.35.020 - Water chargesManner of collection.

For purposes of this section a "monthly basis" means a billing period not exceeding thirty-three days. 
2.  Water Charges When Delinquent. If for any reason the customer, as to a service connection which is served by the city, fails to pay the water charges due for such service on or before the twenty-first day following billing of such water charges by the city, as of that date the water charges shall be deemed delinquent. 
3.  Upon the water charges becoming delinquent, the city manager, or designee, will cause a notice of delinquency and intent to discontinue service to be mailed to the customer of record and actual user. Every notice of termination of service shall include all of the information required in Public Utilities Code § 10010.1(d). 
4.  If payment is not received within fifteen days from the mailing of the notice of delinquency and impending termination, a shutoff notice must be delivered to the service address and posted in a conspicuous location at the premises. When the shutoff notice is delivered and posted, a fee will be applied to the customer's account in accordance with the water charges. Failure to make payment within two business days of notice will result in shutoff of the meter, and assessment of a shutoff fee in accordance with the water charges. 
5.  The restrictions on termination of service set forth in Public Utilities Code § 10010 are applicable to any shutoff proceedings. 
B.  Delinquent Water ChargesPenalties. Penalties shall be imposed upon all delinquent water charges as follows:

3.  Limit of Penalty. The total penalty imposed shall not exceed one hundred percent of the total of any such delinquent account. 
C.  Interruption in Water ServicePenalties. 
1.  Service will be discontinued if payment has not been received or arrangements made to pay the delinquent bill. If payment is not made within the specified time as identified above or for any other reason relating to nonpayment of an outstanding bill or charge, including, without limitation, checks returned for insufficient funds, credit card denial, or other, similar type of payment problem, a service charge, in an amount determined by the water charges, shall be charged and due and payable with respect to each time service is discontinued. 
2.  Except as provided in Public Utilities Code § 10009, where water has been shut off, service shall not be restored until all required payments (including, without limitation, arrearage, penalties, deposits and service charges) have been paid in full. 
D.  If a meter is locked off for nonpayment, the delinquent balance plus all fees assessed as a result of the delinquency become immediately due and payable. Service will be reinstated only during regular working hours and only after payment has been received or special payment arrangements have been made with the finance director. 
E.  Collection of Certain Delinquent Charges. On June 1st of each calendar year, the city manager, or designee, shall prepare a complete list of delinquent charges applicable to the service connection where the owner is the customer for the period ending on April 30th of each calendar year. A notice shall be given, at least forty-five days before the public hearing, of such delinquencies to the owner of the service connection to which each such delinquency relates. The city council shall schedule a noticed public hearing for its second meeting in June of each calendar year at which time delinquent charges together with penalties, shall be placed on the equalized assessment roll for the fiscal year commencing on the July 1st following the conduct of such hearing for collection. Thereafter, the delinquent charges, together with penalties thereon, shall be collected in the same manner, by the same persons, and at the same time as, together and not separately from, general taxes collected on behalf of the city and other taxing authorities. The provisions of this subsection shall only be applicable to delinquent charges where the customer is the land owner. 
F.  Civil Debt. All charges and penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to be civil debts owed to the city by the customer as to the service connection to which such charges and penalties apply.

B.  If it becomes necessary to disconnect the service of any present or future customer because of recurring nonpayment of bills within forty-five days after the same are due, then such customer shall be required to deposit cash in the amount of an estimated two-month billing for the classification of service applied for, as estimated by the utility billing section. No deposit shall be less than sixty dollars. After twelve months' consecutive timely payment of bills, said deposit shall be credited to the next bill. 
C.  Upon the discontinuance of any service, any balance of a deposit remaining in the hands of the city after all bills for utility services provided through said service have been deducted shall be, within sixty days, returned to the person by whom such deposit was made. 
(Ord. 958 § 9, 2002.)

A.  Senior citizens meeting the qualifications in this section shall pay a total monthly charge equal to the monthly service charge for a three-quarter inch meter as defined in the water charges; that is, they shall pay no commodity charge. 
B.  To qualify, a customer must meet all these criteria in a given billing period: 
1.  Be at least sixty-two years old. 
2.  Be in a low-income household as determined by federal guidelines. "Low-income household" means the "30% of Median" household income level as listed by the most current HUD Section 8 Income Limits for Ventura County, California.

D.  All such allowances shall first be recognized on the next full billing cycle after the date of approval. The finance department may require such additional evidence as it deems necessary or appropriate in processing the claim. Only one claimant from each household shall be entitled to allowance. The finance department, at any time, may require a customer to provide proof of continuing eligibility. Any change in the qualification status of the claimant during the fiscal year of the allowance shall be immediately reported by the claimant to the finance department of the city and the appropriate adjustments shall be made accordingly.

B.  The public works director, or designee, shall cause a reminder notice to be mailed to the customer of record and actual user not less than thirty days before the test submission deadline. Failure of the public works director, or designee, to send or for the customer of record to receive a reminder notice shall not relieve the customer of record from the obligations imposed by this section. 
C.  If for any reason the customer fails to submit the test results on or before the thirty-first day after a reminder notice is, or should have been, sent by the public works director, or designee, the test results shall be deemed late. 
D.  Upon the test results becoming delinquent, the public works director, or designee, shall cause a late notice and intent to discontinue service to be mailed to the customer of record or actual user. 
E.  If test results are not received within eight business days from the mailing of the notice of delinquency and impending termination, an attempt will be made to contact an adult person at the premises of the customer by telephone or personal contact. 
F.  If telephone or personal contact is not made at least two business days before service is to be discontinued, a shutoff notice must be delivered to the service address and posted in a conspicuous location at the premises. When the shutoff notice is delivered and posted, a fee will be applied to the customer's account in accordance with the water charges. Failure to submit test results within two business days of notice will result in shutoff of the meter, and assessment of a shutoff fee in accordance with the water charges. 
G.  The restrictions on termination of service set forth in Public Utilities Code § 10010 are applicable to any shutoff proceedings. 
H.  Water service will be reinstated only during regular working hours and only after successful test results are submitted to the department of public works and all fees assessed have been paid to the customer service division or special payment arrangements have been made with the director of finance.

An ancillary business shall be required to obtain and post an ancillary business tax certificate and pay a fee therefor in an amount determined by resolution of the city council. 
D.  Any person who owns or conducts two or more different businesses under the same ownership and which use a single set or integrated set of books and records, may, at his/her option, pay only one tax calculated on the aggregate gross receipts of the businesses.

5.04.060 - Evidence of doing business. 
When any person by any means, including, without limitation, the use of signs, circulars, cards, telephone directories, trade publications, newspapers, advertisements, represents that he/she is in a business in the city, or when any person holds an active license or permit issued by a governmental agency which license reflects that he/she is in business in the city, such person shall be deemed to be conducting a business in the city. 
(Ord. 802 § 1 (part), 1994.)  
5.04.070 - Apportionment. 
A.  None of the taxes imposed by this chapter shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitutions of the United States and the state. 
B.  None of the taxes imposed by this chapter shall be applied to businesses operating both within and outside the city's jurisdiction as to not fairly reflect that proportion of the taxed activity actually carried on within the city. 
C.  In any case where a tax is believed by a certificate holder or applicant for a business tax certificate to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses or to not fairly reflect the proportion of the taxed activity actually carried on within the city, he/she may apply to the director for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be made before, at, or within six months after payment of the prescribed tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show his/her method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the director deems necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The director shall then conduct an investigation, and after having first obtained the written approval of the city attorney, shall fix as the tax for the applicant, an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the tax so fixed. In fixing the tax to be charged, the director shall have the power to base the tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the tax as prescribed by this chapter. Should the director determine the gross receipts measure of tax to be the proper basis, the director may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant's business in the city, or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of tax therefore. The burden of proof is upon the owner of the business claiming an exemption or adjustment pursuant to this section. 
(Ord. 802 § 1 (part), 1994.)  
5.04.080 - Exemptions. 
A.  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to apply to any person transacting and carrying on any business exempt by virtue of the constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of the state from the payment of such taxes as are prescribed in this chapter. 
B.  Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to this section shall file a sworn statement with the director stating the facts upon which the exemption is claimed along with appropriate documentation, and in the absence of such statement substantiating the claim, such person shall be liable for the payment of the taxes imposed by this chapter. The director shall, upon a proper showing contained in the sworn statement, issue a business tax certificate, endorsed on its face "exempt", to such person claiming exemption under this section without payment to the city of the tax required by this chapter. 
C.  The director, after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity for a hearing to a certificate holder, may revoke the exempt status of any business tax certificate granted pursuant to the provisions of this section upon information that the certificate holder is not entitled to the exemption as provided in this section. 
D.  The provisions of this chapter shall not require the obtaining of a business tax certificate to commence or conduct any business or require the payment of any tax, by any bona fide institution or organization which is commenced and conducted wholly for the benefit of charitable purposes or from any nonprofit organization not regularly or primarily engaged in business and from which profit is not derived either directly or indirectly by any person, nor shall any business tax certificate or tax be required for the commencing and conducting of any entertainment, concert, exhibition, lecture or scientific, historical, literary, religious or moral subject or subjects whenever the receipts or net proceeds of such entertainment, concert, exhibition or lecture are appropriated or turned over to any bona fide church or school or to any bona fide religious or benevolent purposes. 
E.  The provisions of this chapter shall not require the payment of a tax for a nonprofit organization which conducts a fund raising activity; provided, that the nonprofit organization conducting such activity utilizes the receipts of such activity for the purposes and objects for which the nonprofit organization was formed and that the nonprofit organization complies with all other provisions of this code. If the nonprofit organization merely sponsors an event and only receives a percentage of the receipts, or receives a specified amount or fee, then each person conducting a business at the event must obtain a business tax certificate in accordance with the provisions of this title. 
F.  Notwithstanding subsection E of this section, in the case of periodic events, which occur more than once a year but which do not take place on a regular daily basis, the sponsor of the event may obtain a business tax certificate for all approved vendors included in the event and pay a tax based upon gross receipts pursuant to Section 5.04.230 of this Code. 
1.  The procedure set forth in this subsection may only be used for events in which the sales from all individual vendors are reported to and recorded by the sponsor of the event so that the sponsor may accurately account for the gross receipts upon which the tax is based. 
2.  When the business tax certificate is issued to a sponsor in accordance with this subsection, all individual vendors shall be conclusively presumed to be exempt from the requirement of obtaining a separate business tax certificate pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, for the purposes of the event. 
3.  If an individual vendor is exempt from the requirements pursuant to this chapter, the sponsor shall pay the tax based upon the gross receipts of those vendors who are not exempt. An individual vendor is not exempt from the provisions of this subsection, based on the fact that such vendor has a business tax certificate for a business elsewhere in the city. 
G.  Notwithstanding subsection E of this section, in the case of annual events, the sponsor of the event may obtain a business tax certificate in accordance with this code for all approved vendors included in the event. 
1.  This method of certification may only be used for events which take place once a year, regardless of the number of days in the event. 
2.  When the business tax certificate is issued to a sponsor in accordance with this subsection, all individual vendors shall be conclusively presumed to be exempt from the requirement of obtaining a separate business tax certificate pursuant to the provisions of this title for the purpose of conducting a business at the event. 
H.  Limited Gross Receipts. The provisions of this chapter shall not require minors, disabled veterans, or adults sixty-five years of age or older if such minors, disabled veterans, or adults are engaged in a business with gross receipts under two thousand five hundred dollars per year to obtain a business tax certificate or pay a tax. 
I.  Garage Sales. The provisions of this chapter shall not require obtaining a business tax certificate or payment of a tax from any natural person engaged in conducting garage sales or yard sales for which all property to be sold is a person's own personal property and has not been acquired or consigned or crafted for the purpose of resale, or for the benefit of other than the occupants of the premises, provided that such garage sales or yard sales do not exceed two in number in any business tax year.

(Ord. 802 § 1 (part), 1994.)  
5.04.105 - Statements, records and audits.

Applications and each of the items contained in an application shall be subject to audit and verification by the director who is hereby authorized to examine, audit and inspect such books and records of any licensee or applicant as may be necessary, in the director's judgment, to verify or ascertain the amount of business tax due.

(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.08.040 - Consideration of initial application. 
A.  Upon receipt of any application for an initial franchise, the city manager must prepare a report and make recommendations respecting such application to the city council. 
B.  The city must notice a public hearing prior to any initial franchise grant. Within sixty days after the close of the hearing, the city council must make a decision based upon the evidence received at the hearing as to whether the initial franchise should be granted, and, if granted, subject to what conditions. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.08.050 - Term of the franchise. 
Any franchise granted under this title will be for the term established in the franchise agreement, but in no event may the term exceed fifteen years from the effective date of the ordinance or resolution authorizing the franchise. A franchise granted hereunder may be renewed upon application by the grantee pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and applicable state and federal law. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.08.060 - Franchise area. 
A franchise will be valid within all the municipal limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.08.070 - Nonexclusive franchise. 
Any franchise granted pursuant to this title will be nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable system, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.08.080 - Multiple franchises. 
A.  The city may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable state or federal law. The city may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as: 
1.  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables and lines in addition to the cables, lines, conduits and pipes of the utility systems. 
2.  The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service. 
3.  The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the disruptions arising from numerous excavations of the public rights-of-way. 
B.  The city may require that any new entrant, nonincumbent grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith if, in the city's opinion, the public rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional facilities. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.08.090 - Franchise nontransferable. 
A.  A grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation or otherwise (collectively "transfer"), the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the city; provided, however, that the prior written consent of the city will not be required for an intracorporate or intracompany transfer from one subsidiary of the grantee's ultimate parent to another subsidiary in which the grantee's ultimate parent retains at least a seventy-five percent interest. The granting of a security interest in any of the grantee assets, or any mortgage or other hypothecation or by assignment of any right, title or interest in the cable system, or use of the cable system as collateral in order to secure indebtedness, will not be considered a transfer for the purposes of this section. 
B.  The requirements of subsection A will apply to any change in control of a grantee. The word "control" as used herein includes majority ownership, and actual working control in whatever manner exercised. In the event that a grantee is a corporation, prior consent of the city will be required where ownership or control of more than twenty-five percent of the voting stock of the grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom own or control the voting stock of the grantee as of the effective date of the franchise, singularly or collectively. 
C.  A grantee must notify city in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or a substantial part of the franchise property. Such notification will be considered by city as notice that a change in control or ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing the consent of the city to such change in control or ownership will apply. 
D.  For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, city may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, in accordance with this section, and the grantee must assist the city in such inquiry. In seeking the city's consent to any change of ownership or control, the grantee has the responsibility of insuring that the grantee or the proposed transferee completes an application in accordance with Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or equivalent. An application must be submitted to the city not less than one hundred twenty days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee will be required to establish that it possesses the legal, technical and financial qualifications to operate and maintain the cable system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If the franchisee is then in compliance with the requirements of the franchise, and the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the city will consent to the transfer of the franchise in accordance with federal regulations. 
E.  Any financial institution having a pledge of a grantee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction or operation of the franchise has the right to notify the city that it or its designee satisfactory to the city will take control of and operate the cable system, in the event of a grantee default of its financial obligations. Further, the financial institution must also agree in writing to continue cable service and comply with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the cable system. 
F.  Any submission of an application for transfer or change of control of a franchise must be accompanied by a deposit in the amount of four thousand dollars. Immediately upon transfer or change of control, the grantee must reimburse the city for the city's reasonable processing and review expenses over four thousand dollars in connection with the transfer or change of control of the franchise, including without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication costs and document preparation expenses, as specified in any franchise agreement. Any such reimbursement may not be charged against any franchise fee due to the city during the term of the franchise or identified as a pass through charge on subscribers' bills. If the city's processing expenses are less than four thousand dollars, any unused funds on deposit will be refunded to the applicant. 
G.  Approval by the city of a transfer or change of control application does not constitute a waiver or release of any rights of the city under this title or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.08.100 - Franchise modification. 
A.  If a grantee desires to modify the franchise, the grantee must submit the request in writing to the city. The city will then provide to the grantee a summary of all costs that the city anticipates it will incur in processing the grantee's request. Such costs may include, but are not limited to, the administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposal, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication requirements with respect to the consideration of the application and document preparation expenses. 
B.  If the grantee agrees to pay and does pay all of these costs in advance, then the city will process the proposed modification. The fact that the city agrees to process the requested modification does not mean that the city has any obligation or intent to accept the proposed modification. 
C.  If the grantee does not agree to pay these costs in advance, or fails to make such payment within thirty days of receipt of the city's summary of costs, and city does not later expressly waive the provisions of this subsection C, then the grantee's request for franchise modification will be deemed withdrawn. 
D.  No modification of the franchise will take effect or be binding on the city, unless and until such modification is approved by the city council. 
E.  Renegotiation, amendment, or other modification to the franchise agreement initiated due to changes in federal or state law are considered changes initiated by grantee. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.08.110 - Franchise renewal. 
Franchise renewals will be in accordance with applicable law. The city and a grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. A franchise will not be subject to renewal once it has expired or otherwise been terminated. A deposit of ten thousand dollars must be paid at the time the renewal is requested. Immediately upon renewal, the grantee must reimburse the city for reasonable processing and review expenses in excess of ten thousand dollars in connection with the renewal, including without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed renewal, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication costs and document preparation expenses. Any such reimbursement may not be charged against any franchise fee due to the city during the term of the franchise or identified as a pass through charge on subscribers' bills. If the city's expenses are less than ten thousand dollars any unused funds on deposit will be refunded to the grantee. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)

The grantee may petition the city to reduce its business hours if the extended hours are not justified by subscriber demand, and the city may not unreasonably deny the petition. 
4.  An emergency system maintenance and repair staff, capable of responding to and repairing major system malfunctions on a twenty-four-hour per day basis. 
5.  An installation staff capable of installing service to any subscriber requiring a standard installation within seven calendar days after receipt of a request, in all areas where trunk and feeder cable have been activated. "Standard installations" are those that are located up to two hundred fifty feet from the existing distribution system, unless otherwise defined in the franchise agreement. However, should such an installation require trenching, the installation must be completed within thirty calendar days after receipt of a request, provided that the grantee is able to obtain all necessary easements and permits. 
6.  When scheduling service calls, appointments with subscribers for installation of service, and other activities at the subscriber location, the grantee must specify a two-hour-time period sometime between eight a.m. and six p.m. for the appointment. The grantee may schedule installation and service calls outside of this time period for the express convenience of the customer. The grantee may not cancel an appointment with a customer after the close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment. If a grantee representative does not keep the appointment within the specified two-hour-time period, (a) the customer must be contacted and the appointment rescheduled for a time which is mutually agreeable to the grantee and the customer; and (b) the grantee may not charge the customer for completing any of the work which was the subject of the original appointment. 
B.  Under normal operating conditions, the standards of subsections (A)(1) and (A)(2) above must be met not less than ninety percent of the time when measured within any three-month period. The standards of subsections (A)(4) through (A)(6) above must be met not less than ninety-five percent of the time when measured within any three-month period. 
C.  The grantee will not be required to acquire equipment or perform surveys to measure compliance with the telephone answering standards of this section, unless a historical record of complaints indicates a clear failure to comply. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.16.020 - Service standards. 
A.  The grantee must render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Scheduled interruptions, insofar as possible, must be preceded by notice, and must only occur during a period of minimum use of the cable system which is generally between midnight and six a.m. local time. 
B.  The grantee must maintain a repair force of technicians capable of responding to subscriber requests for service within the following time frames: 
1.  If at least ten percent of all subscribers are affected by an outage of video or audio on one or more channels, technicians must respond to all requests for service within two hours, including weekends, of receiving subscriber calls or requests for service. 
2.  If at least five subscribers, but less than ten percent of all subscribers are affected by an outage of video or audio on one or more channels, then technicians must respond to a request for service within twenty-four hours of each of the requests, regardless of whether the request was made on weekends or on weekdays. 
3.  If less than five subscribers are affected by an outage of video or audio on one or more channels, the response to the request for service must be made within twenty-four hours of the request during the week, and no later than the next business day if the outage occurs during the weekend. 
4.  For inferior signal quality, within two business days of receiving a request for service identifying a problem concerning picture or sound quality. 
C.  The grantee will be deemed to have responded to a request for service under this section when a technician arrives at the service location and begins work on the problem. In the case of a subscriber not being home when the technician arrives, the technician must leave written notification of arrival. 
D.  Unless excused, the grantee must determine the nature of the problem resulting in a request for service within two business days of beginning work and resolve all cable system-related problems within five business days unless technically infeasible. 
E.  The grantee may not charge for the repair or replacement of defective or malfunctioning equipment provided by the grantee to subscribers, unless the defect was caused by the subscriber, or the equipment owned by the subscriber requires repair or replacement. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.16.030 - Billing and information standards. 
A.  Subscriber bills must be clear, concise and understandable. Bills must be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills must also clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates and credits. 
B.  In case of a billing dispute, the grantee must respond to a written complaint from a subscriber within fourteen calendar days of receipt of the written complaint. 
C.  The grantee must provide pro rata credits or refunds to requesting subscribers whose service has been interrupted for three or more hours, if the interruption was not caused by the subscriber and was caused by events beyond the control of grantee. The minimum credit must equal the charge for one day of cable service for each calendar day with outages of three or more hours. 
D.  Credits or refunds must automatically be provided by the grantee on a pro rata basis to any subscriber affected by an interruption of service for more than three hours due to events within the control of the grantee, exclusive of scheduled repairs, maintenance or franchise-required construction that the grantee has provided advance written notice to subscribers. In cases where advance written notice is provided to subscribers, the time period detailed in the notice may not exceed six hours in any twenty-four-hour period. In cases where such notice has been given to subscribers and the service interruption exceeds the period detailed in the notice, the provisions of this section will apply. 
E.  In the event the grantee has improperly or inadvertently disconnected cable services to a subscriber, the grantee must restore the cable service without charge to the subscriber as soon as possible, but in no event later than two days of discovery of the improper disconnection. The grantee must credit or provide a refund to any subscriber improperly or inadvertently disconnected from receiving cable service for the period of time without cable service. 
F.  All credits or refunds for service must be issued no later than the subscriber's next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted. For subscribers terminating service, refunds must be issued promptly, but not later than thirty days after the return of any grantee-supplied equipment.

H.  Subscribers must be notified of any changes in rates, programming services or channel positions as soon as possible in writing and in accordance with state and federal law. Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of thirty days in advance of such changes if the change is within the control of the grantee. In addition, the grantee must notify subscribers thirty days in advance of any significant changes in the information required in subsection 6.16.030(G). 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.16.040 - Verification of compliance with standards. 
A.  Upon ten calendar day's prior written notice, the grantee must respond to a request for information made by the city regarding grantee's compliance with any or all of the standards required in Sections 6.16.010, 6.16.020 and 6.16.030. The grantee must provide sufficient documentation to permit the city to verify the grantee's compliance. 
B.  Repeated noncompliance with the consumer protection standards of Sections 6.16.010, 6.16.020 or 6.16.030, after the grantee's receipt of notice and not less than a thirty-day opportunity to cure, may, in the city's sole discretion, be declared a material breach of the franchise agreement and violation of this title. 
C.  The city, pursuant to Section 6.16.010(C), may require the grantee to acquire equipment to determine compliance with the telephone answering standards of this chapter. Should the grantee have its own telephone equipment which can report on telephone line usage, the grantee, upon written request from the city, must submit such report from its own system in order to verify compliance with the telephone answering standards of this chapter. 
D.  The grantee must take necessary steps to ensure that adequate telephone lines and staffing are available to permit the grantee to satisfy its obligations under this title and the franchise. Consideration will be given for periods of promotional activities or outages. The monthly billing period will be considered as a normal, daily activity for purposes of determining the availability of adequate telephone lines and staffing. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.16.050 - Subscriber complaints, continuity of service, and resolution of disputes. 
A.  The grantee must establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by the city. The written procedures must prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint either orally or in writing specifying the subscriber's grounds for dissatisfaction. The grantee must file a copy of these procedures with the city. These procedures must meet the approval of the city, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld. 
B.  Upon prior written request, the city has the right to review the grantee's response to any subscriber complaint in order to determine the grantee's compliance with the franchise requirements, subject to the subscriber's right to privacy. 
C.  Subject to applicable law including, but not limited to, the terms of the franchise agreement, all subscribers have the right to continue receiving cable service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. In the event that the grantee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or the city gives notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise, the grantee must ensure that all subscribers receive cable service as long as the franchise remains in force. 
D.  In the event of a change of control of the grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the original grantee must cooperate with the city, new grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, the grantee will be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system. 
E.  The grantee's response to subscriber complaints, as well as complaints made by subscribers to the city and provided by the city to the grantee, must be initiated within one business day of receipt by the grantee. The grantee must resolve a subscriber's complaint not later than five business days after receipt of the complaint, or a longer period, if such complaint cannot reasonably be resolved within five business days. Should a grantee supervisor not be available when requested by a subscriber, a supervisor must respond to the subscriber's complaint at the earliest possible time, and in no event later than the end of the next business day. The grantee must promptly notify the city of the grantee's progress in responding to, and resolving, any complaints forwarded by the city to the grantee. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
6.16.060 - Other requirements. 
A.  In the event the grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive calendar days other than for reasons beyond the control of the grantee, without prior approval or subsequent excuse of the city, the city may, at its sole option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city or a permanent operator is selected. If the city should fulfill this obligation for the grantee, then during such period as the city fulfills this obligation, the city will be entitled to collect all revenues from the system, and the grantee must reimburse the city for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of the revenues collected by the city that are the result of the grantee's failure to perform. 
B.  All officers, agents or employees of the grantee or its contractors or subcontractors who, in the normal course of work come into contact with members of the public or who require entry onto the premises of any subscriber must carry a photo-identification card in a form approved by the city. The grantee must account for all identification cards at all times. Every vehicle of the grantee or its major subcontractors must be clearly and prominently identified as affiliated with or operated by the grantee. 
C.  Additional service standards and standards governing consumer protection and response by grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in this title may be established in the franchise agreement or by separate ordinance as permitted by federal or state law. If the city establishes such additional service standards which exceed any standards established by the federal communications commission or state law, the grantee may be permitted by law or regulation to recover the incremental cost associated with meeting the more stringent standard (i.e., the incremental cost differential between meeting the existing standard and that of the newly established standard). Repeated noncompliance may be deemed a material breach of the franchise, provided that the grantee must receive due process, including prior written notification and a reasonable opportunity to cure, prior to any sanction being imposed. 
(Ord. 985 § 4 (part), 2006.)  
Chapter 6.20 - STATE VIDEO FRANCHISES 
Sections: 
 
6.20.010 - Purpose and application. 
This chapter is designed to regulate video service providers holding state video franchises and operating within the city pursuant to that franchise. On January 1, 2007, the state of California became the sole authority with power to grant state video franchises pursuant to the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 ("DIVCA"). Pursuant to DIVCA, the city of Camarillo shall receive a franchise fee and a fee for public, educational and/or government (PEG) purposes from all state video franchise holders operating within the city. Additionally, the city acquired the responsibility to establish and enforce penalties, consistent with state law, against all state video franchise holders operating within the city for violations of customer service standards. DIVCA precludes the city from adopting its own standards and grants all authority to adopt customer service standards to the state. DIVCA leaves unchanged the city's authority to regulate the city's existing cable franchises until the expiration of any such franchises.

Pursuant to CMC Section 6.04.010, Camarillo's programming is defined as Education and Government (EG) only. 
(c)  In addition, any state franchisee that has held a locally issued franchise agreement shall, consistent with Public Utilities Code section 5870, continue to fully provide and support PEG channel facilities and institutional networks and to provide cable services to community buildings to the maximum extent permitted by law.

(b)  The city manager or the manager's designee shall monitor the compliance of state video franchise holders with respect to state and federal customer service and protection standards. The city manager or the manager's designee will provide the state video franchise holder written notice of any material breaches of applicable customer service standards, and will allow the state video franchise holder thirty days from the receipt of the notice to remedy the specified material breach. Material breaches not remedied within the thirty-day time period will be subject to the following penalties to be imposed by the city: 
(1)  For the first occurrence of a violation, a fine of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to exceed one thousand five hundred dollars for each violation. 
(2)  For a second violation of the same nature within twelve months, a fine of up to one thousand dollars may be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to exceed three thousand dollars for each violation. 
(3)  For a third or further violation of the same nature within twelve months, a fine of up to two thousand five hundred dollars may be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars for each violation. 
(c)  A state video franchise holder may appeal a penalty assessed by the city manager to the city council within sixty days of the initial assessment. The city council shall hear all evidence and relevant testimony and may uphold, modify or vacate the penalty. The city council's decision on the imposition of a penalty shall be final.

B.  If the finding is that the animal is a public nuisance, the poundmaster must determine what actions, up to and including humane destruction of the animal or removal of the animal from the possession and control of the owner, are reasonably necessary in order to abate the nuisance and will enter an order that the owner of the animal take all such actions within such time limits as the order may prescribe and abide by the terms and conditions of the order.

The owner of the animal may appeal an order of the poundmaster under Sections 7.32.120.B or 7.32.130.B for the humane destruction of the animal or the permanent removal of the animal from the possession and control of the owner if the underlying nuisance finding does not involve either (1) an unprovoked infliction of physical injury upon any person where such person is acting lawfully, or (2) an unprovoked infliction of physical injury upon any other animal which occurs off the property of the owner of the animal inflicting the injury. The poundmaster will notify the owner of such animal in writing at the time of the proposed order of humane destruction or the permanent removal of the animal from the possession and control of the owner regarding the right to appeal such determination in the manner provided in this section. 
B.  Timing of Appeal. The aggrieved owner may appeal such proposed order to the city manager by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk no later than seven business days following the date the poundmaster gives notice of the order by personally serving the order or depositing it in the mail. The appeal must set forth with particularity the reasons the owner disagrees with the determination of the poundmaster. 
C.  Payment of Appeal Fee and Pound Charge. The notice of appeal must be accompanied by the applicable administrative appeal fee established by city council resolution. If the animal is impounded at the time of the filing of the appeal, the appeal must also include a deposit payable to the city equal to the impoundment charge for at least thirty days in order to defray the cost of maintaining the animal at the pound during the pendency of the administrative appeal. In the event the administrative appeal and any judicial appeal extends beyond such 30-day period, as provided in Section 7.32.060, the owner will be liable for all such additional impoundment charges unless the proposed order of the poundmaster or the decision of the city manager, as applicable, is reversed. 
D.  Setting Appeal Hearing. Upon receipt of a timely filed appeal, the city manager will fix a time and place for hearing the appeal. The appeal may be heard by the city manager or a hearing officer designated by the city manager. All references in this section to the city manager include a designated hearing officer. 
E.  Notice of Appeal Hearing. The city clerk must give written notice of the time and place of the appeal hearing to the appellant, and any other person requesting notice, at least five business days prior to the hearing date. The notice of the hearing may be served either by personal delivery or by depositing a copy in the United States mail, postage prepaid. 
F.  Appeal Hearing Procedure. At the hearing, the city manager will review the records and files of the poundmaster relating to the proposed order. The city manager must permit the appellant and the poundmaster to present any relevant evidence bearing on the issues involved in the matter. In conducting the hearing, the city manager is not bound by formal rules of evidence and may accept all reasonably reliable evidentiary material. 
G.  Decision. Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the city manager must determine whether the proposed order of the poundmaster should be affirmed, modified, or reversed. The city manager's decision must be communicated in writing to the appellant within five business days after the hearing is completed and must state the reasons for the decision. The notice of the decision may be served either by personal delivery or by depositing a copy in the United States mail, postage prepaid. If the proposed order of the poundmaster is reversed and the animal is ordered released to the owner, the city will promptly refund the owner's deposit for the impoundment charge and the appeal fee. 
H.  Judicial Review. The determination of the city manager will be final. The written notice of decision must be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid. The notice must advise that any action challenging the decision of the city manager must be filed with the superior court of the state pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5, and must further advise that the time period within which judicial review must be sought is ninety days following the date of the city manager's written notice under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6. If the order of the poundmaster is affirmed and the owner's animal has been impounded, the notice of determination must also advise the owner of the continuing liability for impoundment charges and request that the owner notify the city in writing within ten business days of the date of the notice whether such owner intends to pursue such judicial appeal or whether the owner consents to the humane destruction of the animal or the removal of the animal from the possession and control of the owner, as applicable. If the owner does not respond to this request, the poundmaster will continue to maintain the animal at the owner's expense at the pound and if no appeal is filed within the applicable 90-day period, upon the expiration of this appeal period, the poundmaster may proceed with the humane destruction of the animal or the removal of the animal from the possession and control of the owner, as applicable.

If the city manager's investigation demonstrates that the franchisee is operating in a manner contrary to such franchise or any applicable law, the city manager must advise the franchisee in writing of the results of such preliminary investigation. 
B.  Hearing. If significant potential violations are found, the city manager may set the matter for a hearing and must give the franchisee, and any other person who has requested notice, not less than ten days written notice of the time and place of such hearing. The city manager will act as the hearing officer and will permit any interested person, including the franchisee, to offer any reliable evidentiary material to show that the franchisee either did, or did not, conduct its operations in accordance with its franchise or any applicable law. If the city manager determines, based upon the evidence presented, that the franchisee has not operated in accordance with its franchise or the provisions of any applicable law, the city manager will issue an order terminating the franchise ("order"). Such order must contain a statement of findings and conclusions upon which such order is based, and the effective date of such termination. If the city manager finds that the evidence is not sufficient to establish a failure to comply with the franchise, the city manager will terminate the proceedings. The decision of the city manager will be final in the absence of a timely appeal. 
C.  Appeals. Any franchisee aggrieved by the issuance of a termination order has the right to appeal such order in the manner provided in Chapter 1.14.

1.  Basic Penalty. A basic penalty of ten percent of the total delinquent charges and fees applicable will be imposed as of the date of any such delinquency. 
2.  Additional Penalties. An additional penalty of ten percent will be imposed on the total delinquent charges and fees on each billing date upon which the charges and fees remain unpaid.

Upon payment of the delinquent fees and charges, containers will be returned to the premises and the franchisee will resume collection. Payment of any delinquent account by check will generally result in a delay of twelve business days to resume collection service or such time as it takes for the check to clear.

Upon written request for a hearing by the property owner received by the city manager within ten days after mailing the cost notice, a hearing shall be held by the city manager, or designee, on the question of the cost of the abatement. 
B.  Notice of the hearing shall be mailed at least ten days before the hearing by registered or certified mail, to the owner of the land.

(Ord. 947 § 5 (part), 2002.)  
9.17.100 - Nuisance abatement lien and special assessment procedures. 
A.  Lien and/or Assessment. Any person failing to abate a public nuisance as ordered pursuant to this chapter will be liable for the all city costs and expenses associated with abating the nuisance. A nuisance abatement lien in favor of the city for such costs and expenses may be recorded against the property on which the nuisance is maintained pursuant to this section and/or the city may place a special assessment against the property for such costs and expenses. 
B.  Notice of Proposed Lien and/or Assessment. Prior to filing the lien, the city clerk must give ten day's notice to the property owner by first-class and certified mail, addressed to the property owner's address as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll or supplemental roll of the county of Ventura, whichever is more current. If the owner of record, after diligent search, cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy of the proposed lien in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days and by publishing notice of the lien in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in the manner provided by Government Code Section 6062. If the city intends to make the lien an assessment against the subject property, the notice must specify that the property may be sold after three years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. 
C.  Recording. Upon recordation, the lien will have the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and may be foreclosed by judicial or other sale in the manner and means provided by law. 
D.  Special Assessment. In addition to, or as an alternative to recordation of a lien, the city may collect the amount owed as a special assessment against the property owner's parcel. To do so, the city must present a copy of the lien to the county auditor controller to add the amount of the lien to the next regular property tax bill levied against the parcel for municipal purposes. This amount will be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary property taxes are collected, and will be subject to the same penalties and procedures under foreclosure and sale as provided for with ordinary municipal taxes. 
E.  Satisfaction of Lien. Once the city receives full payment for the outstanding principal, penalties, and costs related to a recorded lien, the city clerk will cause to be recorded a notice of satisfaction at the county recorder's office. This notice of satisfaction will cancel the city's lien.

2.  Commencing a civil action to abate a public nuisance as an alternative, to or in conjunction with, an administrative proceeding pursuant to this chapter; 
3.  Filing a civil action to recover the amount of a confirmed accounting from an owner or occupant of the lot to which it relates; or 
4.  Filing a criminal action to enforce this code.

(Ord. 947 § 5 (part), 2002.)  
9.17.130 - Emergency abatement. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, whenever the city manager, or designee, determines that a public nuisance, as defined in this chapter, or in any other applicable law, exists upon a lot, and that such public nuisance constitutes an immediate threat or hazard or danger to persons or property, the city manager, without observing procedures set forth in this chapter with reference to public nuisance abatement, may forthwith immediately cause the abatement of such public nuisance in such manner as the city manager, or designee, determines is reasonably required. If the city manager, or designee, deems it feasible, the city manager, or designee, shall attempt to give the owner and occupant, verbal notice of the existence of the public nuisance, and the proposed timing and method of abatement thereof. The city manager shall, forthwith, report such circumstances to the city council.

9.22.020 - Findings and declarations.

A.  The HIV/AIDS crisis and the ongoing epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases, to which the making of adult films has contributed, have negatively affected public health and the quality of life of residents of the city. 
B.  Safer sex practices can prevent and reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. 
C.  Public health research has documented widespread transmission of sexually transmitted diseases by unprotected sexual activity such as occurs in the adult film industry in the metropolitan Los Angeles area.

H.  Recent efforts to promote safer sex in the adult film industry in Los Angeles County and Ventura County have caused producers of adult films to seek out filming locations in areas of the city, creating a threat to public health and safety.

A.  Notice. The city manager must give the owner or other person entitled to possession of the building, fence, landscaping or structure not less than twenty-four hours' written notice that unless the graffiti or other inscribed material to which the notice relates is removed within the period of time set forth in the notice, that the city will enter upon the property for the purpose of summarily abating the public nuisance by removal of the graffiti or other inscribed material. The notice must also contain a statement that if the graffiti or other inscribed material is not timely removed by the owner or other person entitled to possession of the building, fence, landscaping or structure and if the removal is done instead by the city or its agents then all costs incurred may be assessed against the property upon which the graffiti or other inscribed material is located, in the time and manner set forth in Section 9.17.100 of this code.

The expense of abatement of the nuisance may be assessed as a lien against property of the minor or other person and becomes a personal obligation of the minor or other person pursuant to Section 10.48.170.

Pursuant to Government Code Sections 38772, 38773.2, and 38773.6, and any successor statutes, a minor or other person (as defined in Section 10.48.160 of this code) creating, causing or committing a nuisance resulting from the defacement of the property of another by graffiti or any other inscribed material, will be obligated to pay all city expenses and all administrative costs associated with abating the nuisance. 
A.  Recordation of a Lien That Will Become a Judgment Lien. A nuisance abatement lien in favor of the city for such expenses of the city may be created and recorded, pursuant to this section, against the property of the minor or other person, or the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor. The lien must specify: the amount of the lien, that the lien is imposed on behalf of the city, the date of the abatement order, the street address, legal description and assessor's parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel. 
1.  Notice must be served on the minor or other person, or parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor, before recordation of the lien on the parcel of land owned by the minor or other person, or parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor. The notice must be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Sections 415.10 and following. If the minor or other person, or the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor, after diligent search, cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place upon the property owned by the minor or other person, or by the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor, for a period of ten days, and by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
2.  The city's nuisance abatement lien may then be recorded in the county recorder's office, and from the date of recording, will have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien and may be foreclosed by an action brought by the city for a money judgment. 
3.  Any fees or costs incurred by the city for processing or recording the lien and providing notice to the minor or other person, or parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor, may be recovered by the city as part of any action to enforce the lien. 
B.  Recordation of Lien That Will Become a Special Assessment. The city's total abatement costs as described in this chapter, may also be collected as a special assessment against the parcel of land owned by the minor or other person, or by the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor. 
1.  Prior to recordation, a notice of nuisance abatement lien must be sent by certified mail to the property owner at the address appearing on the latest equalized assessment roll. 
2.  In addition to the matters set forth in subsection (A) of this section, the notice of the nuisance abatement lien must specify that the lien will constitute a special assessment that will be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and will be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure for foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. If payments are permitted to be made in annual installments, the rate of interest on the unpaid balance must be specified. 
3.  After confirmation and recordation of the nuisance abatement lien that will constitute a special assessment, the city will provide a copy of the notice of proposed recordation, proof of service, and the recorded lien to the tax collector to add the amount of the assessment to the next regular tax bill levied against the respective parcel. Any costs incurred by the city in connection with recording the lien may be added to the assessment. 
4.  The city manager may determine that in lieu of collecting the entire assessment at the time and in the manner of ordinary municipal taxes, the assessment may be paid in annual installments over a period not to exceed five years. If any installment is delinquent, the amount will be subject to the same penalties and procedure for foreclosure and sale provided for ordinary municipal taxes. Any assessments so deferred will bear interest on the unpaid balance at a rate of six percent per year. 
5.  If any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrance for value has been created and attached thereon before the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement will not result in a lien against the real property but instead will be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
C.  Satisfaction. In the event that the judgment lien or special assessment is satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, a notice of discharge containing the information specified in the lien will be recorded by the city.

A tenant on a non-fixed term lease who receives a notice of a proposed rent increase may file a request for the commission to review the proposed rent increase in a mediation. The request should be filed with the city clerk within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice of a proposed rent increase. The request must identify the owner and state the reason for the tenant's claim that the proposed rent increase is unreasonable or unfair.

B.  Scheduling of a Mediation. Upon the city clerk's receipt of a request for a rent review mediation, the clerk will contact the owner named in the request and the tenant and attempt to set up a mediation to be held before the commission. The mediation will be scheduled within a reasonable time. If the increase affects more that 25 percent of the tenants with non-fixed term leases, then the owner must provide a list of all such affected tenants so that notice of the mediation may be provided to all interested tenants. 
C.  Submissions by Owner. If the owner agrees to participate in the rent review mediation, then at least seven days before the mediation, the owner should submit to the city clerk information concerning the residential rental unit or space at issue, which may include, but is not limited to the following:

E.  Mediation Procedure. At the mediation, the parties may offer any statements, documents, or other information that is relevant to the proposed rent increase.

(Ord. No. 1121, § 3(Exh. A), 2-24-2016)

The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not including highways is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property not including highways except as expressly permitted in this title, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. 576 § 1 (part), 1985.)  
11.64.020 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for terminal designation and truck route designation to terminals for interstate trucks operating on a federally designated highway system and to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the public. 
(Ord. 576 § 1 (part), 1985.)  
11.64.030 - Application. 
A.  Any interested person requiring terminal access for interstate trucks from the federally designated highway system shall submit an application, on a form as provided by the city, together with such information as may be required by the director and appropriate fees to the city. 
B.  Upon receipt of the application, the director will cause an investigation to be made to ascertain whether or not the proposed terminal facility meets the requirements for an interstate truck terminal. Upon his approval of that designation, he will then determine the capability of the route requested and alternate routes, whether requested or not. Determination of route capability will include, without limitation, a review of adequate turning radius and lane widths of ramps, intersections and highways, and general traffic conditions such as sight distance, speed and traffic volumes. No access off a federally designated highway system will be approved without the approval of Caltrans. 
C.  Should the requested route pass through the city to a terminal located in another jurisdiction, the applicant shall comply with that jurisdiction's application process as well. Coordination of the approval of the route through the city will be the responsibility of the entity which controls the terminal's land use. Costs for trailblazer signs shall be as provided in Section 11.64.040. 
(Ord. 576 § 1 (part), 1985.)  
11.64.040 - Fees and costs.

Trailblazer signs will be required at every decision point in the city on route to the terminal. Upon completion of the installation of the signs, the actual cost shall be computed and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant, whichever the case may be. No terminal or route may be used until such signs as may be required are in place. Costs for trailblazer signs may be proportioned in accordance with the procedures in Section 11.64.050C. 
(Ord. 576 § 1 (part), 1985.)  
11.64.050 - Retrofitting. 
A.  If all feasible routes to a requested terminal are found unsatisfactory by the director, the applicant may request retrofitting the deficiencies. All costs of engineering, construction and inspection will be the responsibility of the applicant. Except when the retrofitting of deficiencies is within the jurisdiction of Caltrans, the actual construction will be done by the city or by a contractor acceptable to it. 
B.  When the work is to be done by the city, the applicant shall deposit with the city the estimated cost of retrofitting. Adjustments between the estimated and actual cost shall be made after completion of the work, and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant as the case may be. 
C.  If at any time within five years from the date of completion of the retrofitting by the applicant, should any applicant seek terminal approval which would use the route upon which such retrofitting was accomplished, any such applicant's fee may include that applicant's proportionate share of the retrofitting, as determined by the director, which fee shall be disbursed by the city to the applicant who paid for the retrofitting, as well as to any applicant who contributed to the cost of retrofitting under this subsection. 
(Ord. 576 § 1 (part), 1985.)  
11.64.060 - Revocation of route. 
The director may revoke any approved terminal or route if the terminal or route becomes a traffic hazard for vehicular traffic. A safety hazard includes the inability of interstate trucks to negotiate the route, or said vehicles causing unsafe driving conditions for other vehicular traffic or pedestrians. 
(Ord. 576 § 1 (part), 1985.)  
11.64.070 - Appeal process. 
A.  If the director denies terminal designation, route feasibility, or revokes a previously approved terminal or route, the director shall notify the applicant thereof in writing. The applicant or terminal owner, within ten days following the date of the decision of the director, may, in writing, appeal the decision to the city manager. An appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the director and shall be filed with the city clerk, together with the payment of the appeal fee. The appeal shall state specifically wherein there was an error or abuse of discretion by the director, or wherein the decision not supported by the evidence in the record. Within five days of the filing of an appeal, the director shall transmit to the city clerk the terminal application, the sketches of the revoked route and all other data filed therewith, the report of the director, the findings of the director, and the decision on the application. 
B.  The city clerk shall make copies of the data provided by the director available to the applicant and to the appellant (if the applicant is not the appellant) for inspection. The city manager shall set the matter for hearing and give not less than ten calendar days written notice to all interested parties of the time and place of the hearing. The decision of the city manager shall be final and conclusive, subject only to timely judicial review pursuant to Section 1094.5 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
C.  If Caltrans and not the director denies or revokes terminal access from federally designated highways, no appeal may be made to the city manager; all such appeals must be made as may be permitted by Caltrans' regulations.

Chapter 11.68 - TRAFFIC IMPACT MITIGATION FEES 
 
11.68.010 - Findings. 
The city council finds and determines as follows: 
A.  Based on the staff reports, documentation and oral presentations made by city staff, the city council originally enacted this chapter in 1989, imposing a traffic mitigation fee program ("program"). 
B.  Pursuant to the provisions of this chapter as originally adopted, a computerized traffic modeling study was to be prepared in order to update the program. 
C.  A computerized traffic modeling study ("study") was prepared by the city's traffic engineering consultants and has been adopted by resolution of the city council. 
D.  Based upon the study and other evidence presented to the city council, the city council has concluded as follows: 
1.  All types of new development within the city will cause a burden on the city's circulation system as well as on certain portions of the adjacent county circulation system, will contribute to a reduction in levels of service below those which currently exist, will result in unacceptable traffic congestion and related adverse impacts, and in some cases will result in traffic volumes that exceed the street capacity at acceptable levels of service; and 
2.  A failure to expand the capacity of the existing circulation system will cause a reduction in levels of service, unacceptable levels of congestion on streets and intersections, traffic accidents, air pollution, noise, and restrictions on access for emergency vehicles; and 
3.  In the absence of this program imposing a fair share traffic mitigation fee upon new development, existing and future sources of revenue will be inadequate to fully fund the circulation system improvements necessary to avoid a reduction in levels of service and unacceptable levels of congestion and related adverse impacts; and 
4.  All types of new development in the city will directly benefit from circulation system improvements; and 
5.  It is necessary to impose a traffic mitigation fee ("fee") on all types of new development within the city in an amount equal to the new development's share of needed traffic improvements; and 
6.  The public, interest, convenience and necessity require the adoption and implementation of the provisions of this program. 
(Ord. 779 § 1, 1993: Ord. 696 § 1 (part), 1989.)  
11.68.020 - Purpose. 
A.  The adoption of this chapter will raise additional revenues for construction of necessary circulation system improvements to accommodate traffic that will be generated by development of land within the city consistent with the Camarillo general plan. 
B.  This chapter contains a fair and equitable method of determining the extent to which the development of land will generate traffic volumes impacting the roadway system and establishes a fair and equitable method for distribution of unfunded costs of circulation system improvements necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by such development. 
C.  This chapter and the actions taken pursuant to its terms are necessary to assure that development takes place in a manner consistent with the city's general plan. 
D.  This chapter and the actions taken pursuant to its terms are necessary to provide a fair and equitable method of mitigating the significant cumulative environmental impacts of traffic generated by development within the city. This chapter shall not preclude the imposition of additional mitigation measures to address significant direct impacts of any development, or to address otherwise unfunded roadway improvements, nor shall this chapter preclude the city from adopting statements of overriding considerations where desirable and appropriate or from denying any discretionary development based on traffic impacts. 
(Ord. 696 § 1 (part), 1989.)  
11.68.030 - Definitions. 
A.  "Development" means any discretionary or ministerial action by the city resulting in the issuance of grading, building, plumbing, mechanical, or electrical permits, conditional use permits, other land use entitlement permits or certificates of occupancy issued by the city to construct, change, or make lawful the use of a building or property. 
B.  "Future growth" means the level of new development anticipated in Camarillo consistent with the general plan and shall be expressed in terms of square footage for commercial and industrial uses and in terms of dwelling units for residential uses. 
C.  "Level of service" means the different operating conditions which occur at an intersection or on a roadway when accommodating various traffic volumes.

11.68.040 - Establishment of traffic mitigation fee. 
A.  Applicability. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all new development which will generate additional vehicle trips. 
B.  Basis of Fee. A traffic mitigation fee shall be based upon the unfunded roadway improvement costs attributable to new development and the number of trips attributable to new development in each traffic mitigation fee district. The resultant traffic mitigation fee for each category of new development in each traffic mitigation fee district shall be adopted by resolution of the city council. 
C.  Calculation. Traffic mitigation fees will be calculated in accordance with the following procedures:

2.  Traffic mitigation fee districts ("districts") shall be established by resolution of the city council based on geographic areas within the city where new development generally impacts the same locations; 
3.  The Nexus Routine shall be used to determine the share of each impact caused by each new development in each district; 
4.  The unfunded traffic improvement costs for each improvement will then be distributed to each land use category of new development in each district in accordance with the same pro rata share developed by the Nexus Routine in determining the percentage of impact attributable to that land use category of new development; 
5.  New Mixed Use Buildings. Where there are multiple uses within a new building (mixed use building), the following shall apply: 
a.  For each new mixed use building where there are multiple uses proposed, the traffic mitigation fee shall be in an amount equal to the combined total of the traffic mitigation fees for each of the uses proposed within the building. 
b.  For each mixed use building where the various proposed uses cannot clearly be segregated into separate categories, the traffic mitigation fee for the entire building shall be based on the mixed use traffic mitigation fee formula. 
6.  Change in Use. 
a.  For any change in use or uses, if the new use or uses are in a higher traffic mitigation fee category than the existing use or uses, then the additional traffic mitigation fee shall be in an amount equal to the difference between the traffic mitigation fee for the new use or uses and the traffic mitigation fee for the former use or uses. 
b.  For any of the uses in subsection (C)(6)(a) of this section, that cannot clearly be segregated into separate categories, the traffic mitigation fee for the unsegregative uses shall be based on the mixed use traffic mitigation fee formula.

Each such hearing shall be open to the public and may be continued from time to time. At each such hearing all persons interested shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The decision of the council shall be final and conclusive. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7501.)  
13.08.030 - Report by city engineer. 
Prior to holding such public hearing, the city engineer shall consult with all affected utilities and shall prepare a report for submission at such hearing containing, among other information, the extent of such utilities' participation and estimates of the total costs to the city and affected property owners. Such report shall also contain an estimate of the time required to complete such underground installation and removal of overhead facilities. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7502.)  
13.08.040 - Designation of districts by council resolution. 
If, after any such public hearing, the council finds that the public necessity, health, safety, or welfare requires such removal and such underground installation within a designated area, the council, by resolution, shall declare such designated area an underground utility district and order such removal and underground installation. Such resolution shall include a description of the area comprising such district and shall fix the time within which such removal and underground installation shall be accomplished and within which affected property owners shall be ready to receive underground service. A reasonable time shall be allowed for such removal and underground installation, having due regard for the availability of labor, materials, and equipment necessary for such removal and for the installation of such underground facilities as may be occasioned thereby. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7503.)  
13.08.050 - Unlawful acts. 
Whenever the council creates an underground utility district and orders the removal of poles, overhead wires, and associated overhead structures therein as provided in Section 13.08.040, it is unlawful for any person or utility to erect, construct, place, keep, maintain, continue, employ, or operate poles, overhead wires, and associated overhead structures in the district after the date when such overhead facilities are required to be removed by such resolution, except as such overhead facilities may be required to furnish service to an owner or occupant of property prior to the performance by such owner or occupant of the underground work necessary for such owner or occupant to continue to receive utility service as provided in Section 13.08.100, and for such reasonable time required to remove such facilities after such work has been performed, and except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7504.)  
13.08.060 - Emergencies or unusual circumstances. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, overhead facilities may be installed and maintained for a period not to exceed thirty days, without authority of the city council in order to provide emergency service. For a limited period of time the city engineer may grant special permission, on such terms as he deems appropriate, in cases of unusual circumstances, without discrimination as to any person or utility, to erect, construct, install, maintain, use, or operate poles, overhead wires, and associated overhead structures. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7505.)  
13.08.070 - Additional exceptions. 
The provisions of this chapter and any resolution adopted pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.08.040 unless otherwise provided in such resolution, shall not apply to the following: 
A.  Any municipal facilities or equipment installed under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the city engineer; 
B.  Poles or electroliers used exclusively for street lighting;

Within ten days after the effective date of a resolution adopted pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.08.040, the city clerk shall notify all affected utilities and all persons owning real property within the district thereby created, of the adoption of the resolution. The city clerk shall further notify such affected property owners of the necessity that, if they or any person occupying such property desire to continue to receive electric, television cable, communication, or similar or associated services, they or such occupant shall provide all necessary facility changes on their premises so as to receive such service from the lines of the supplying utility or utilities at a new location. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7507.)  
13.08.090 - Responsibility of utility companies. 
If underground construction is necessary to provide utility service within a district created by any resolution adopted pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.08.040, the supplying utility shall furnish that portion of the conduits, conductors, and associated equipment required to be furnished by it under its applicable rules, regulations and tariffs on file with the commission. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7508.)  
13.08.100 - Responsibility of property owners. 
A.  Every person owning, operating, leasing, occupying, or renting a building or structure within a district shall construct and provide that portion of the service connection on his property between the facilities referred to in Section 13.08.090 and the termination facility on or within such building or structure being served. 
B.  In the event any person owning, operating, leasing, occupying or renting such property does not comply with the provisions of subsection A of this section within the time provided for in the resolution enacted pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.08.040, the city engineer shall post written notice on the property being served and thirty days thereafter may authorize the disconnection and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying utility service to such property. 
C.  The notice to provide the required underground facilities may be given either by personal service or by mail. In case of service by mail, the notice shall be deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope with postage prepaid, addressed to the person in possession of such premises at such premises, and to the owner thereof as such owner's name appears, and at the address shown on the last equalized assessment roll and, when no address appears, to General Delivery, City of Camarillo, California. If notice is given by mail, such notice shall be deemed to have been received by the person to whom it has been sent within forty-eight hours after the mailing thereof. If notice is given by mail to either the owner or occupant of such premises, the city engineer shall, within forty-eight hours after the mailing thereof, cause a copy thereof, printed on a card not less than eight inches by ten inches in size, to be posted in a conspicuous place on such premises. 
D.  The notice given by the city engineer to provide the required underground facilities shall particularly specify what work is required to be done and shall state that if such work is not completed within thirty days after receipt of such notice, the city engineer shall provide the work for such required underground facilities, in which case the cost and expense thereof shall be assessed against the property benefited and become a lien upon such property. 
E.  If, upon the expiration of the thirty day period, the required underground facilities have not been provided, the city engineer shall forthwith proceed to do the work; provided, however, if such premises are unoccupied and no electric, television cable service, or communications services are being furnished thereto, the city engineer may, in lieu of providing the required underground facilities, authorize the disconnection and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying utility service to such property. Upon completion of the work by the city engineer, he shall file a written report with the council setting forth the fact that the required underground facilities have been provided and the cost thereof, together with a legal description of the property against which such cost is to be assessed. The council shall thereupon fix a time and place for hearing protests against the assessment of the cost of such work upon such premises, which time shall not be less than ten days thereafter. 
F.  The city engineer shall forthwith, upon the time for hearing such protests having been fixed, give a notice in writing to the person in possession of such premises and a notice in writing thereof to the owner thereof, in the manner provided in subsection C of this section for the giving of the notice to provide the required underground facilities, of the time and place the council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against such assessment. Such notice shall also set forth the amount of the proposed assessment. 
G.  Upon the date and hour set for the hearing of protests, the council shall hear and consider the report and all protests, if there be any, and then proceed to affirm, modify, or reject the assessment. 
H.  If any assessment is not paid within five days after its confirmation by the council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien upon the property against which the assessment is made by the city engineer, and the city engineer is directed to turn over to the assessor and tax collector a notice of lien on each of such properties on which the assessment has not been paid, and the assessor and tax collector shall add the amount of the assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the premises upon which the assessment was not paid. Such lien shall be due and payable, and, if not paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per year. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7509.)  
13.08.110 - Responsibility of city. 
The city shall remove at its own expense all city owned equipment from all poles required to be removed under this chapter in ample time to enable the owner or user of such poles to remove the same within the time specified in the resolution enacted pursuant to the provisions of Section 7503. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7510.)  
13.08.120 - Extension of time. 
In the event any act required by the provisions of this chapter or by a resolution adopted pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.08.040 cannot be performed within the time provided on account of shortage of materials, war, restraint by public authorities, strikes, labor disturbances, civil disobedience, or any other circumstances beyond the control of the actor, then the time within which such act shall be accomplished shall be extended for a period equivalent to the time of such limitation. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7511.)  
13.08.130 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The council finds and determines that the public interest requires, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, that all facilities and wires for the supply and distribution of electric energy and service, television cable service, and telephone and telegraph service for all new construction and land developments shall be placed underground in order to promote and preserve the health, safety, and general welfare of the public and to assure the orderly development of the city. 
B.  The council also finds that the public interest requires, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, that all facilities and wires for the supply and distribution of electric energy and service, television cable service, and telephone and telegraph service shall be placed underground in order to promote and preserve the health, safety and general welfare of the public, and to assure the orderly development of the city under the following circumstances: 
1.  When such facilities are located in a public easement or public right-of-way adjacent to new construction or land development; 
2.  When such facilities are in a public utility easement adjacent to new construction or land development and service to the proposed new construction or land development is to be provided by such facilities; 
3.  When such facilities are on the site of the proposed construction or land development to the nearest existing suitable pole off-site; 
4.  When such facilities are in a utility easement and any portion of which easement, aerial, surface or underground, is over or on the site of the proposed new construction or land development. It is the intent of this subsection to require undergrounding of such facilities in the event such easement consists of contiguous parcels, separated only by a property line. 
In the event such facilities are in a public utility easement adjacent to new construction or land development but no part of which easement lies upon the site of the proposed new construction or land development and service to the proposed new construction or land development is not to be provided by such facilities, the planning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council on the utility undergrounding requirements therefor, and prior to any permit being issued for such construction or development, the city council shall take final action and determine whether such facility shall be undergrounded as a condition to a permit being issued for such development or construction. 
Facilities as used in this subdivision shall include poles, wires and any other appurtenances for the supply and distribution of the service referred to herein. 
(Ord. 478 § 1, 1980; Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7512.)  
13.08.140 - Underground utilities in new construction or building. 
The subdivider, land developer or property owner is responsible for complying with the requirements of this chapter, and he shall make the necessary arrangements with the utility companies for the installation of such facilities subject to the utilities' rules, regulations, and tariff schedules on file with the State Public Utilities Commission. This chapter shall apply to all property for which any development permit or approval for development by the city is required, including all property within subdivision maps and parcel maps hereinafter filed with the county recorder, except as provided for in this section. For the purposes of this chapter, appurtenances and associated equipment such as but not limited to, surface-mounted transformers, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, and concealed ducts in an underground system may be placed above ground. 
The city council after review and recommendation by the planning commission, may waive the requirements of this chapter if topographical, soil or any other conditions make such underground installations unreasonable or impractical. 
A.  The city engineer may accept a bond to guarantee later undergrounding of facilities if on the following criteria he finds undergrounding to be unfeasible at the time of construction or modification: 
1.  The project is not within an established underground utility district, but is within or adjacent to a proposed district; 
2.  The location, topography, soil condition, or other factor(s) make undergrounding not technically or economically feasible at the time of construction or modification. 
An estimate of the cost of the undergrounding shall be prepared by the subdivider and shall accompany the improvement. Cost estimates shall include a separate item for contingencies in the amount of ten percent of the estimated actual cost. Based on the estimate submitted by the subdivider, the city engineer shall determine the final estimated cost for the undergrounding. Security posted for the undergrounding shall be for the full amount of the estimated costs as determined by the city engineer. Security shall be of the type specified in Section 66499 of the Government Code and before acceptance by the city engineer, shall be approved by the city attorney as to form and legal sufficiency. 
This section shall not apply to: 
a.  Overhead facilities approved by the city engineer to be installed and maintained for a period not to exceed thirty days in order to provide emergency service; and 
b.  Temporary poles, overhead wires, and associated structures used, or to be used, in conjunction with construction projects; and 
c.  Poles, overhead wires, and associated overhead structures used for the transmission of electric energy at voltages in excess of thirty-three thousand volts. 
B.  Except as provided for in this section, all utility facilities, including service laterals shall be installed in the ground prior to the paving of streets. The city engineer may authorize installation of utility facilities after street improvements are installed if the installation will not require reconstruction or repair of the street improvements or if unusual circumstances warrant. At the time of recommending approval of the tentative map for a proposed subdivision, the planning commission may recommend modification of the requirement for all or part of a subdivision where, due to physical conditions, it would cause undue hardship. 
Both transformers and access points must be placed so as to safeguard the public against any hazard created by said equipment and to preserve good neighborhood appearance. 
All utilities to be installed shall be installed within the street, alley, or walkway dedication as approved by the city engineer, or in easements obtained by the utility company adjacent thereto. The city engineer may allow deviations from this requirement of placement when compliance is deemed impractical, or where any conflicting paramount laws would allow such deviation. 
The subdivider shall make all necessary arrangements for underground installations and for relocation of existing facilities with the utility companies involved. There shall be provided in each subdivision by the subdivider trenching, conduit and miscellaneous substructures necessary for the installation of cable television and its appurtenant electronic gear. 
C.  In the development of a residential single-family lot or in any land division in an existing established built up family residential area, which results in four or less separate single-family residential lots that are in an existing overhead area where future undergrounding or extension of undergrounding to the surrounding areas is not contemplated within the foreseeable future, undergrounding of utilities shall be imposed as a condition; provided, however, that if such a condition is imposed, the owner in lieu thereof may pay a fee in the amount established by the city council by resolution. 
In the event the application of the provisions of this subsection would be inequitable or would create a hardship and relief from this subsection would not be inconsistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter, the city council upon application being made may provide relief from this subsection on such terms and conditions as it may deem necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. 478 § 2, 1980: Ord. 431 § 1, 1979: Ord. 367 § 1, 1977; Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7513.)  
13.08.150 - Plans required. 
Plans detailing the location of all underground utilities hereinafter installed shall be prepared by the subdivider making the installation and submitted to the public works department of the city for approval in accordance with standards adopted by the city council. The public works department shall provide inspection services to ensure the installation of all underground utilities in accordance with city approved plans. The subdivider making the installation shall bear the cost to the city of the inspection services. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7514).  
13.08.160 - Appeal. 
A.  When any condition for undergrounding is imposed by the planning commission, or by any administrative officer of the city as a condition to the issuing of any permit or the approving of any development, such determination may be appealed to the city council upon payment of such fee as may be determined from time to time by action of the city council. Any appeal shall be made by filing written notice thereof with the city clerk within thirty days from the date of the determination. 
At least ten days prior to the time the appeal is to be heard by the city council, the city clerk shall give written notification to such utility of the time and place of hearing. 
The city council may affirm, reverse, or modify the recommendation of the planning commission or staff member and may waive or conditionally waive the provisions of this chapter when it finds that the requirements of an undergrounding installation of utility lines would be unreasonable or impractical considering but not limited to the following: 
1.  Geological or soil conditions; 
2.  Topographical conditions; 
3.  When the development of commercial, industrial or residential property which is in an existing overhead area and where undergrounding or extension of undergrounding to surrounding areas is not contemplated within such length of time as the council deems reasonable so as to require immediate undergrounding and the city council determines that the area is unique and of special circumstances. 
The city council in relation to such other relief as it may afford may require the developer or permittee to make a cash deposit in lieu of actual construction or undergrounding; the amount shall be determined by resolution of the city council. Such fee shall be deposited and maintained in an undergrounding fund, and the proceeds of such fund may be used from time to time for undergrounding projects anywhere within the city at such time and in such manner as the city council may determine. 
B.  In addition to such other relief as the city council may grant, it may provide for the apportionment of costs of undergrounding between two developers when it finds that to do so would be equitable. In considering whether such costs shall be apportioned, the council may give consideration to the following: 
1.  The developments are adjacent to each other; 
2.  They are required to underground a common facility which traverses portions of each of the developments; 
3.  The time of development will be approximately the same. 
In the event the city council determines that the cost of undergrounding shall be apportioned between two or more developers, the council in determining the pro rata share of each developer shall give consideration to, but is not bound by, the portion of the facility within each development and the benefit to be derived. Likewise, the city council may determine whether the initial cost shall be borne by one developer, or whether funds shall be deposited with the city for disbursement to the affected utility. 
(Ord. 478 § 3, 1980: Ord. 431 § 1 (part), 1979: Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7515.)  
13.08.170 - Compliance with provisions prerequisite to issuance of building permits. 
No building permit shall be issued for any new construction or land development unless the applicant's plans comply with the provisions of this chapter or until the applicant has obtained a waiver of the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7516.)  
13.08.180 - Aboveground equipment. 
For the purposes of this chapter, appurtenances and associated equipment, including, but not limited to, surface-mounted transformers, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, and concealed ducts in an underground system, may be placed aboveground. 
(Ord. 353 § 1 (part), 1977: prior code § 7517.)

A.  All new and replacement trees and other plantings must be consistent with the comprehensive plan; provided, however, that owners or developers of property fronting on any street or public area may petition the planning commission to request that other trees or other plants be used in such streets or public areas be of a certain kind or variety. Any action on such petition is subject to the discretion of the commission. 
B.  The planning commission may require that the planting of street trees be included in all building plans that appear before the commission for approval, and that all related costs be borne by the property owner. The selection or approval of species and the specifications for planting will be the responsibility of the department of community development. 
C.  The planning commission may require the planting of trees and other plantings within any street or public area within any new development or subdivision seeking an approval from the commission and such trees or other plantings must be in conformity with the comprehensive plan or project-specific landscape plan covering the area involved. 
D.  Any proposed change in a public street right-of-way, direction, width, or configuration, or any proposed street improvement must, where feasible, include allowances for planting strips. Plans and specifications for planting such areas must be integrated into the plan of improvements. The department must coordinate the design of such improvements with the community development department prior to final approval of the overall plans. When the planting strips are situated between the inside edge of sidewalk and the property line, adequate space or an easement must be retained or obtained to accommodate the desired plantings in accordance with the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. 999 § 1 (part), 2006.)  
13.12.060 - Maintenance and removal of trees and other plantings. 
A.  Except as may be provided in any applicable land use entitlement, or where the underlying fee title is vested in a person other than the city and the city so elects, the city will, at its own cost and expense, inspect, maintain and, when it desires, remove or replace approved street trees and other plantings in city streets and public areas. 
B.  The director is responsible for the inspection, maintenance, removal and replacement of all approved, specimen, historic and memorial trees within city streets and public areas as defined in this chapter, except that no tree designated as an historic or specimen tree may be removed without prior approval of the planning commission and no tree designated as a memorial tree may be removed without prior approval of the city council. 
C.  The director may cause the roots of approved trees to be cut to prevent sidewalk, curb, street or utility damage. Overhead limbs may be pruned or cut back to compensate for loss of root area. 
D.  The director may cause the removal or replacement of any unapproved tree or other planting with city streets or public areas.

(Ord. 809 § 1 (part), 1994.)  
14.04.050 - Requirements of cross-connection control program. 
A.  Water System. 
1.  The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the utility system (external system) and the customer/user system (internal system). 
2.  Utility system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system, and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the utility, up to the point where the customer/user's system begins. 
3.  The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the distribution system. 
4.  The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system. 
5.  The customer/user's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the utility distribution system that are utilized in conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use. 
B.  Policy. 
1.  No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulations and this chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow-prevention assembly required by this chapter is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow-prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. 
2.  The customer/user's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the administrator shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with applicable laws relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
3.  If required, an approved backflow-prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line. Installation shall be per standards established by the program. 
a.  In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and that is not acceptable as an additional source by the administrator, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard. 
b.  In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectional substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in quality. 
c.  In the case of premises having (1) internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved reduced pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly in the service line. This section shall also be applicable to those commercial or industrial buildings that are subdivided into several individual businesses or industries and for which there is a high tenant turnover. 
4.  The type of protective assembly required under subsection B3(a) through (c) of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows: 
a.  In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection B3(a) of this section and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly. 
b.  In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazards to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly. 
c.  In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention. Example of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants. 
d.  In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly at the service connection. 
e.  In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly on each service to the premises. 
f.  In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the administrator, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, the administrator may require an air gap at the service connection to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the administrator and is dependent on the degree of the hazard. 
g.  Fire sprinkler system lines shall have at a minimum a detector check double-check valve backflow-prevention device installed for external system protection, except in such cases where prohibition of such device is mandated by state law. If not restricted by state law and if warranted by degree of hazard, a reduced principle backflow-prevention device with detection meter may be required by the administrator. 
5.  An approved backflow-prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the administrator. 
6.  It shall be the duty of the user at any premises where backflow-prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the administrator deems the hazard to be great enough, certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by a certified tester approved by the administrator. It shall be the duty of the administrator to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The user shall notify the administrator in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the administrator may witness the tests if so desired. The customer user shall send copies of test results to the administrator. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be submitted to the administrator. 
7.  All presently installed backflow-prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection B6, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the administrator is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the administrator finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. 809 § 1 (part), 1994.)  
14.04.060 - Certification of backflow-prevention device testers. 
A.  No person shall be deemed to be qualified to inspect, maintain, and repair backflow-prevention devices unless his/her qualifications have been established to the satisfaction of the administrator. 
The administrator shall have authority to establish qualifications and conduct examinations in order to certify individuals that are qualified to inspect and maintain backflow-prevention devices. Upon successful completion of such examination and training as deemed necessary pursuant to provisions of this section, the person so examined shall receive a certificate of competence. Any limitations or conditions imposed on the examinee in the inspection and maintenance of backflow-prevention devices shall be stated upon the face of said certificate issued to such examinees. 
The administrator shall make available to all owners of property upon which backflow-prevention devices are installed or required a list of persons qualified to install and maintain such devices. 
Every person after receiving a certificate of competence shall be issued such identification as deemed appropriate and such identification shall be kept in the immediate possession of every person engaged in inspecting, maintaining, or repairing any backflow-prevention device.

14.04.070 - Booster pumpsRegulation. 
When it becomes necessary, on account of low pressure or special operating conditions, to install a booster pump on the service to any premises, such pump shall be equipped with a low pressure cutoff switch designed to shut off the pump when the pressure on the inlet side is twenty-five p.s.i.g. or lower. It shall be the duty of the water user to maintain the cutoff device in proper working order, and to certify to the administrator at least once a year that the device is operable. 
(Ord. 809 § 1 (part), 1994.)  
14.04.080 - County health department responsibility for water systems on customer premises. 
A.  The county health department shall be responsible for internal water system protection. The International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Official Uniform Plumbing Code shall be utilized regarding cross-connection control within each customer/user's premises. 
B.  With the permission of the administrator, internal cross-connection control protection may be utilized for external (utility system) protection if such devices and/or means of protection are equivalent to that required for external protection; if such devices are inspected and maintained in accordance with this chapter; and if related test/maintenance/ repair reports are supplied to the administrator on at least an annual basis. Failure to comply with these requirements shall mandate the customer installation of a device or devices for external system protection. Failure of the customer to install this device or devices shall initiate the discontinuance of water service to the customer's premises. 
C.  Water systems for fighting fire, derived from a supply that cannot be approved as safe or potable for human consumption shall, wherever practicable, be kept wholly separate from drinking water pipelines and equipment. In cases where the domestic water system issued for both drinking and firefighting purposes, approved backflow-prevention devices shall be installed to protect such individual drinking water lines as are not used for firefighting purposes. 
D.  Potable water pipelines connected to equipment for industrial processes or operations shall be disconnected therefrom if practicable. Where disconnection is not practicable, an approved backflow-prevention device, the type or kind depending on the degree of hazard, shall be located in the feed line to the process piping or equipment, beyond the last point from which drinking water may be taken. 
In the event the particular process liquid is especially corrosive or apt to prevent reliable action of a mechanical backflow-prevention device, air-gap separation shall be provided. All backflow-prevention devices shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced whenever they are found to be defective. Records of tests, repairs and replacements shall be submitted to the county health department and to the administrator if required. 
E.  Sewage pumps and storm water pumps shall not have priming connections unless the drinking water system is protected as set forth in Section 14.04.050, and no connections shall exist between the drinking water system and any other piping, equipment or tank in any sewage treatment plant, sewage pumping station, or storm water pumping station. 
F.  Backflow protection by an approved backflow-prevention device shall be provided on each drinking water pier-head outlet used for supplying vessels at piers or waterfronts. These assemblies must be located where they will prevent the return of any water from the vessel into the drinking water pipeline or into another vessel at such pier or waterfront. 
G.  Backflow protection consisting of an air-gap or approved reduced pressure principle device shall be provided at all domestic water system outlets used for supplying permanent or portable tanks and vessels used or intended for use in spraying or otherwise disseminating fertilizer, fungicide, herbicides, insecticides, or other toxic substances. 
Comparable backflow protection shall be provided at all domestic water system outlets supplying a field irrigation system of either a sprinkler or subsurface type. 
H.  Where the premises contain dual or multiple water systems and piping, the exposed portions of pipelines shall be painted, banded, or marked at sufficient intervals to distinguish clearly which water is potable and which is not safe for consumption. All outlets from secondary or potentially contaminated systems shall be posted as contaminated and unsafe for drinking purposes. All outlets intended for drinking purposes shall be plainly marked to indicate the fact. 
When color marking is used, potable water lines shall be painted green and nonpotable water lines shall be painted yellow. This requirement may be met by painting three-inch wide bands green or yellow at intervals of not more than twenty-five feet and at points where piping passes through walls, floors or roofs in which case the bands shall be applied on both sides of the walls and both above and below the floor or roof. Points of outlets for nonpotable water shall be marked with a tag or color coded. 
When tags are used, potable water lines shall be identified by three-inch diameter metal tags bearing the legend "safe water" in letters not less than one-half inch in height. 
Nonpotable water lines shall be identified by firmly attached, metal tags having the shape of a four-inch equilateral triangle bearing the legend "unsafe water" in letters not less than seven-sixteenth inch in height. 
As in the color bands, tags shall be attached to pipes at intervals of not more than twenty-five feet and at either side of walls and above and below points where pipes pass through floors and roofs. 
I.  The county health department and the city shall be kept informed of the identity of the person responsible for the water piping on all premises concerned with this chapter. At each premises where it is necessary in the opinion of the health department or the city a water supervisor shall be designated. The water supervisor shall be responsible for the installation and use of pipelines and equipment for the avoidance of cross-connections, compliance with this chapter and for reporting to the water purveyor any changes in water usage. 
In the event of contamination or pollution of the drinking water system due to a cross-connection on the premises, the county health department and the city shall be promptly advised by the person responsible for the water system so that appropriate measures may be taken to overcome the contamination or pollution. 
(Ord. 809 § 1 (part), 1994.)  
14.04.090 - Cross-connection survey required. 
A.  Building plans shall be examined by the administrator to insure that the plumbing system does not contain cross-connections or potential cross-connections and meets the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  The administrator shall have the authority to conduct a survey of new premises to determine the status of cross-connections or the cross-connection potential. Denial of entry upon such premises shall require customer installation of external system protection as determined by the administrator. Customer failure to install external system protection shall initiate the discontinuance of water service to the customer's premises. 
C.  Those commercial buildings or industrial buildings or other businesses that change ownership or type of business or type of process shall be required to undergo a cross-connection survey. The administrator shall direct the level of survey required. If entry upon the premises is requested by the administrator and this request denied, said administrator may require customer installation of external system protection. Customer failure to install external system protection shall initiate discontinuance of water service to the customer's premises. 
(Ord. 809 § 1 (part), 1994.)  
14.04.100 - Penalties for noncompliance.

14.12.060 - Administrative review and appeals of penalties. 
A.  Administrative Review Procedure. 
1.  Persons may request an administrative review of any penalty imposed under this chapter within 10 days of the issuance of the notice of violation. This request must be made in writing to the city clerk and set forth with particularity the reasons the person believes a violation did not occur or that the person was not responsible for the violation and contain the address to which the conclusions of the city's review should be mailed. A request for an administrative review is a mandatory prerequisite to a request for an administrative hearing. Penalties, including termination of water service, will be stayed until such review is conducted and a written decision is made by the water conservation administrator. 
2.  Upon receiving a request for an administrative review, the water conservation administrator will review the request and within 10 business days provide the person with a written determination as to whether the penalty was properly assessed. 
3.  The administrator must mail a copy of the notification to the person at the address on the request for administrative review along with notice establishing the penalty date and the procedure for requesting an appeal hearing. 
B.  Appeal Hearing Procedure. 
1.  Any person dissatisfied with the conclusion of the initial administrative review may contest the penalty by requesting an administrative appeal hearing. A person must file a request for an administrative appeal hearing with the city clerk within 10 days after the date the city served the person with notice of the administrative review decision. The request must be accompanied by the appeal hearing fee, if any, established by city council resolution. Pending receipt of a written appeal or pending a hearing pursuant to an appeal, the city may take appropriate steps to prevent any further unauthorized use of water as appropriate to the nature and extent of the alleged violations and the current declared water supply condition. 
2.  The appeal hearing will be scheduled to occur within a reasonable period of time following the receipt of the request for a hearing not to exceed 15 business days unless consented to by the appellant. 
3.  The appellant may present any evidence that would tend to show that the alleged violation did not occur. Formal rules of evidence will not apply and all relevant evidence will be admissible, unless a sound objection warrants its exclusion by the city hearing officer designated by the city manager. The decision of the hearing officer will be final and conveyed in writing to the appellant within five business days of the hearing.

Chapter 36 is added to the CBC to read as follows: 
CHAPTER 36 
SWIMMING POOLS 
 3601. DEFINITIONS. For the purpose of this Chapter certain terms are defined as follows: 
 "Pool" means any body of water created by artificial means which is designed or used for swimming or immersion purposes by men, women, or children and which has a water depth exceeding 18 inches. The term pool includes swimming pools, spas, hot tubs and above- and below-ground vinyl-lined pools but does not apply to plumbing fixtures such as bathtubs; nor does it apply to man-made lakes, reservoirs, or farm ponds used primarily for public park purposes, water conservation, irrigation, or watering of livestock. 
 3602. POOL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. 
 (a) GENERAL. Pool design and construction must be accomplished in accordance with accepted engineering practice, in conformity with applicable code provisions, and be structurally suitable for the soil, topographic, and geologic conditions prevailing at the construction site. 
 (b) EXPANSIVE SOIL DESIGN. Pools constructed at grade must be designed on the assumption that their construction is to be in an area of moderately expansive soil having an expansion index of 51-90 and an equivalent fluid pressure of not less than 45 pounds per cubic foot (45 p.c.f.). Exception: Where tests indicate that soils at a pool site are non-expansive or have low expansion characteristics from the ground surface to the full depth of the pool, structural design must be based on an equivalent fluid pressures not less than 30 p.c.f. 
 In highly-expansive soils having an expansion index of 91-130, pools must be designed for not less than 60 p.c.f. equivalent fluid pressure. In very highly- expansive soils having an expansion index over 130, pool design will be subject to special requirements based on a site investigation, soil testing, and engineering analysis by a registered civil engineer to determine appropriate design parameters for the site. 
 (c) HYDROSTATIC UPLIFT. In areas of anticipated high water table, an approved hydrostatic relief system or device must be installed. 
 (d) THERMAL PROTECTION FOR PLASTIC PIPING. Between the inlet of pool water-heating equipment and any plastic water piping connected thereto, a check valve must be installed to prevent thermal damage to such piping due to backflow. Exception: When rapid or high-rate filters are employed, a check valve may be omitted. 
 Between the outlet of pool heating equipment and any plastic water piping connected thereto, not less than five feet of approved metal pipe must be installed for the purpose of dissipating heat. 
 (e) SAFEGUARDING SUCTION DRAINS. Bottom drains and suction intakes in pools and spas must be covered with grated or other protective devices, which cannot be removed except with tools. The slots or openings in these covers must be of such area, shape, and arrangement as to prevent bathers from being drawn thereto with such force as to constitute a safety hazard. 
 (f) GRAB BARS. Wherever egress from a pool by bathers is restricted by the presence of a vertical wall or other barrier, which extends more than 12 inches above the water at the pool's edge, permanent handrail, grab bars, or equivalent device(s) must be installed within 12 inches of the water surface capable of being securely grasped and adequate to support the weight of a user of the pool. 
 3603. DECKS. 
 (a) GENERAL. A deck must be provided around below-grade swimming pools except when special engineering design is furnished which indicates that such deck is not necessary for the purpose of maintaining the structural integrity of the pool, and/or for controlling surface water and moisture content in the soil adjacent to the pool. Decks are not required for spas and hot tubs. 
 (b) DECK DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. Required decks must be constructed of concrete or other approved impervious material and be sloped to provide positive drainage away from the perimeter of the pool. Except as provided below, decks must have a minimum width of four feet and be at least 3-1/2 inches in thickness. Reinforcement must be No. 3 bars spaced not over 24 inches on center each way, or equivalent reinforcing. 
 Approved joints must be provided in the deck at corners, at maximum 10-foot intervals, and wherever necessary in order to control cracking, to allow for differential movement, and to minimize damage to the deck from such movement should it occur. Joints in decks and coping must be made watertight with an approved permanent resilient sealant. 
 (c) CUTOFF WALLS. At the outer perimeter of pool decks, a cutoff wall of approved material must be installed below-grade to a depth of at least 15 inches to form a permanent and effective vertical moisture barrier. 
 Exceptions: 
 1. A cutoff wall may be omitted when a deck of at least six feet wide is installed. 
 2. Decks less than four feet in width may be installed provided that the required cutoff wall is increased in depth beyond the minimum by an amount directly proportional to the reduction in deck width. 
 (d) PRE-SATURATION, HIGHLY EXPANSIVE SOILS. When the soil below a deck has an expansion index of 91 or greater, it must be saturated with water to a depth of at least 18 inches before installing the deck. 
 (e) DECK BONDING. When a deck is installed, whether structurally required or not, the reinforcing installed in the deck must be electrically bonded together with the pool shell reinforcing and metal parts of electrical equipment associated with the pool water recirculation system and with miscellaneous metal accessories, such as pool slides, diving boards, and spring boards, in accordance with CEC Article 680.26. 
 3604. DRAINAGE AND DISPOSAL. 
 (a) SURFACE WATER. Surface water from pool decks must be collected and conducted through non-erosive subsurface drainage devices to a street, storm drain, or other approved watercourse or disposal area. 
 (b) WASTEWATER. Pool waste must be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the environmental health officer. 
 (c) DRYWELLS. Drywells cannot be employed for pool wastewater disposal except when specifically approved for the purpose, and when it has been determined that such installation is not likely to have adverse effects on the structural stability of the pool or other structures on the site. The Building Official may require a percolation test, soils report, and/or geological report to make such a determination. 
 3605. SPECIAL INSPECTION. Special inspection, as required by CBC § 1705A.3, must be provided for pneumatically-placed concrete (gunite) in swimming pools. 
 3606. FENCING AND GATES. Any person, firm, or corporation in possession of landeither as owner in fee, purchaser under contract, lessee, tenant, licensee or any type of legal estate upon which is situated a pool as defined abovemust at all times maintain on the lot, or premises, a fence or wall not less than five feet in height which completely surrounds such pool or body of water provided, however, that a dwelling or accessory building may be used as a part of such enclosure. Such fence must be constructed of durable material and must be designed to withstand a horizontal force of at least 20 pounds per lineal foot at the top of the fence or top of the railing. Openings, holes, or gaps therein must be no larger than four inches wide, except for openings closed by doors or gates. Fences may not have a configuration which provides a ladder-like access to the pool area. 
 Each gate or door opening through a pool enclosure must be equipped with a self-closing and self-latching device capable of keeping the gate or door securely closed at all times when not in use. 
 Exceptions: 
 1. Doors in Group R, Division 1, 2 and 3 occupancies which form part of a pool enclosure. 
 2. Gates used primarily for ingress and egress of equipment but not persons to the pool area, and which are kept padlocked when not in use. 
 Required latching devices must be installed not less than 60 inches above ground level and on the water side of the gate. 
 The Building Official may make modifications and accept alternatives to the fencing requirements in individual cases upon a showing of good cause with respect to the height, nature or location of the fence, wall, gates, or latches, or the necessity for such alternative, provided that protection is not reduced.

16.04.135 - Ministerial and discretionary permits. 
Section J101.1.1 of the CBC Appendix is added to read as follows: 
 J101.1.1. Ministerial and Discretionary Permits. Issuing or denying a grading permit is a ministerial act for the purposes Public Resources Code § 21080 (b)(1) except in the following four circumstances: 
 1. Where the average natural slope within the area to be graded exceeds 109 percent and the amount of excavation or fill exceeds 10,000 cubic yards; 
 2. Where the average natural slope within the area to be graded exceeds 35 percent and the amount of excavation or fill exceeds 1,000 cubic yards; 
 3. Where the proposed graded slopes exceed 25 feet in vertical height; or 
 4. Where the proposed grading would occur within a waterway or wetland. 
 The discretionary powers exercised in conjunction with issuing or denying of discretionary grading permits are exercised by the Building Official, or by the city council on appeal. Those discretionary powers are limited to the issuance of the permit, subject to conditions or changes in the project needed to mitigate significant environmental effects, which would otherwise result from the grading; or denying the permit in order to avoid such effects; or issuing the permit despite such effects upon making appropriate findings. 
 With respect to discretionary grading permits, the Building Official can issue or deny the permit only after holding a public hearing, considering the applicable environmental document, if any, and certifying that such document was prepared in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Building Official must give at least 15 days written notice of such hearing to the applicant for the permit and to any owner of real property located within 300 feet of the boundaries of the lot to which the application relates and to the property whose interests might be substantially affected by a permit. The notice must specify the time, date, and place of the hearing; give a general description of the grading to which the permit application pertains; give a general description of the property on which the grading would occur; and state that any interested person will be given an opportunity to present relevant evidence at the hearing. 
 Any interested person may appeal the Building Official's decision by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk along with a fee established by city council resolution within 10 days after the Building Official's decision. The hearing on appeal must be noticed and conducted by the city council in the same manner as the original hearing before the Building Official, except that notice must also be given to the appellant. The city council's decision is final and must be in writing. A copy of the decision must be served upon the applicant for the permit and upon the appellant. If the decision is to issue a grading permit previously denied or to modify a grading permit previously issued by the Building Official, the written order constitutes the permit and must include appropriate conditions. 
 A ministerial grading permit is operative immediately upon issuance. A discretionary grading permit becomes operative on the 15th calendar day after being issued or, in the case of an appeal, on the date the city council issues its decision.

 901.4.1 (GREEN) INSPECTED - LAWFUL OCCUPANCY PERMITTED. Posted on any building or structure where no apparent hazard has been found. Placement of this placard does not mean that there is no damage to the building or structure. 
 901.4.2 (YELLOW) RESTRICTED OR LIMITED ENTRY. Posted on each damaged building or structure where damage has created a hazardous condition which justifies restricted occupancy. The Building Official who posts this placard will note in general terms the hazard created and will clearly and concisely note the restrictions on occupancy. 
 901.4.3 (RED) UNSAFE - DO NOT ENTER OR OCCUPY. Posted on each damaged building or structure such that continued occupancy poses a threat to life or health. Buildings or structures posted with this placard may be entered only after authorization in writing by the building official. Safety assessment teams are authorized to enter these buildings at any time. This placard may not be used or considered as a demolition order. The official who posts this placard must make a note in general terms of the damage encountered. 
 901.4.4 SECURING OF UNSAFE BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES. Buildings or structures that have been determined by the Building Official to pose a threat to life safety or to be unsafe due to damage may be required by the Building Official to be secured from entry by fencing or other approved means until such time that the damage or threat to life is removed by repair, reconstruction or demolition. The fencing or security measures may not be removed without authorization from the building official. 
 901.4.5 REMOVAL OF PLACARDS. Once the placard has been attached to a building or structure, it may not be removed, altered, or covered until authorized by the Building Official. 
 901.5 VIOLATION. Any violation of § 16.04.400 of this code is a misdemeanor and will be subject to punishment according to the provisions of § 16.04.310.

FAX: (916) 653-9824 
 902.4 ABATEMENT CRITERIA 
 902.4.1 NOTICE OF DETERMINATION. Except as provided in Section 902.4.2 below, the Building Official must serve a written Notice of Determination to each property owner as found on the latest available copy of the last equalized assessment roll. Such Notice of Determination must be delivered by hand-delivery, telephone, telegram, facsimile or other reasonable means, and must clearly indicate that the structure is an imminent hazard and dangerous and that, as such, it constitutes a public nuisance. The notice must set forth those factors which, in the opinion of the Building Official, make the structure an imminent hazard and dangerous, and must also include a directive from the Building Official of the specific action or actions to be taken by the property owner. The Notice must specify that within 48 hours from the time of issuance of the Notice of Determination, the owner or other party of record with an equitable or legal interest in the property must abate the nuisance in accordance with the directives written in the Notice of Determination by the Building Official. 
 902.4.2 NOTICE OF DETERMINATION EXCEPTION. No prior notice is required, when the building official, after considering all the facts, determines, in writing, that the structure is an imminent hazard and dangerous, and that it must be abated immediately and that time and circumstances do not permit the giving of prior notice to the owner. In those cases where time and circumstances do not permit the city to give the owner notice prior to abatement, the Building Official may cause the nuisance to be summarily abated. 
 902.4.3 APPEAL OF NOTICE OF DETERMINATION. A Notice of Determination delivered by the Building Official, that a building or structure is an imminent hazard and dangerous and therefore must be abated, may be appealed by the property owner or any other party of record with an equitable or legal interest in the property. Such appeal must be made to the Building Official within 48 hours of delivery of such Notice of Determination by the Building Official. Such appeal must be accompanied by a written Hazard Abatement Plan signed by a State of California licensed engineer or architect or by a written report by a State of California licensed engineer or architect stating why the engineer or architect feels the building or structure is not an imminent hazard or dangerous at this time. Such report must include a recommendation by the engineer or architect as to what should or should not be done at this time. If the Building Official accepts the proposed Hazard Abatement Plan in lieu of the Notice of Determination, the Hazard Abatement Plan must be implemented within 24 hours of acceptance by the Building Official. If the Building Official accepts an engineer's report and agrees there is no imminent hazard, the Building Official must rescind, in writing, the Notice of Determination. 
 Should the Building Official disagree with the Hazard Abatement Plan, or should the Building Official disagree with the engineer's or architect's report, a hearing must be conducted by the Board of Appeals, as soon as a quorum can be assembled. 
 902.4.4 BOARD OF APPEALS HEARING. At the hearing, the appellant has the right to call witnesses, to submit evidence, and to cross-examine the witnesses of the city. All witnesses must be sworn. 
 A record of the proceedings must be made by tape recording. Any relevant evidence may be submitted, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions in the courts of this State. 
 At the close of the hearing, the Board of Appeals must act to uphold, overrule, or modify the determination and order of the Building Official. The determination and order of the Building Official will be upheld, unless the Board of Appeals finds, based upon the evidence in the record, that the Building Official erred in determining that the structure is an imminent hazard and dangerous. The decision of the Board of Appeals, with the reasons therefore, may be given orally on the record. If given orally, the decision must be memorialized in writing and served upon the applicant within 24 hours of the time the oral decision is rendered. 
 If the Board of Appeals upholds the decision of the Building Official, the property owners of record will be ordered to abate the public nuisance within the time set forth in the order. If the structure is determined not to be an imminent hazard and dangerous, the Building Official's determination and order will be vacated. The decision of the Board of Appeals will be final on the date it is rendered. 
 902.4.5 HAZARD ABATEMENT PLAN. If a Hazard Abatement Plan is approved by the Building Official, the owner or other interested party of record must execute such plan within 24 hours of obtaining approval of the plan from the Building Official. Within 24 hours of completion of the abatement work the owner or other interested party of record must provide the Building Official with a written certification that the public nuisance, as described in the Building Official's Notice of Determination, has been abated. 
 If the work performed pursuant to the Hazard Abatement Plan amounts to temporary abatement, the owner or other party of record, prior to proceeding with permanent repairs, must obtain required permits and file a damage assessment report with the Building Official. The damage assessment report must be reviewed and approved by the Building Official prior to proceeding with permanent repairs. 
 902.4.6 FAILURE TO PERFORM. In those instances where the property owner or other interested party of record either does not respond to the Building Official's Notice of Determination or approved Hazard Abatement Plan, responds untimely, or responds timely but fails to abate the public nuisance within the required time period, the imminent hazard and dangerous structure will be subject to immediate abatement by the Building Official. 
 902.4.7 PUBLIC NUISANCE. All structures or portions of such structures which, after inspection by the Building Official, are determined to be an imminent hazard and dangerous, either to the public, occupants of the subject structure, or to any adjacent structures, are hereby declared to be public nuisances and must be abated by the owner in accordance with the procedures specified in Sections 43.2.4.4 and 43.2.4.5. 
 902.4.8 SUSPENSION OF ABATEMENT OF WORK. Notwithstanding any code provisions to the contrary, the Building Official is authorized to suspend abatement work, and to allow the property owner or other party of legal interest to complete the abatement work. 
 902.4.9 CHANGE OF STATUS. When the conditions making a structure an imminent hazard and dangerous have been abated, the structure will no longer be considered an imminent hazard and dangerous. However, if the abatement work is temporary in nature, as determined by the Building Official, the structure will remain subject to the provisions of this section. 
 902.4.10 DEMOLITION PERMIT. If the owner of any building or structure has decided to demolish rather than repair, the owner, or the owner's representative, must obtain a demolition permit. 
 902.5 HAZARD ABATEMENT OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES. 
 902.5.1 NOTIFICATION OF IMMINENT HAZARD. Within ten days after the event, the Building Official must notify the State Historic Preservation Officer that one of the following actions will be taken regarding any historic building or structure determined by the Building Official to represent an imminent hazard to the health or safety of the public, or to pose an imminent threat to the public right of way: 
 902.5.1.1 BRACING OR SHORING. Whenever possible, as determined by the Building Official, the building or structure may be braced or shored in such a manner as to mitigate the hazard to public health or safety or the hazard to the public right-of-way. 
 902.5.1.2 CONDEMNATION. Whenever bracing or shoring is determined to be an unreasonable alternative, the Building Official may cause the building or structure to be condemned and immediately demolished. Such condemnation and demolition may be performed in the interest of public health or safety without a condemnation hearing as required by the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings. 
 902.5.2 CONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS. If, ten days after the event and less than 30 days after the event, an historic building or structure is determined by the Building Official to represent a hazard to the health or safety of the public or to pose a threat to the public right of way, the Building Official may initiate condemnation proceedings in accordance with the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings. The Building Official may also notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, of its intent to hold a condemnation hearing. 
 902.5.3 REQUEST TO DEMOLISH. If the Building Official and the owner of any historic building or structure agree that such a building or structure should be demolished, the Building Official must submit a request to demolish to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1986, as amended. Such request must include all substantiating data.

C.  Termination. If the individual with a disability who initially occupied the applicable dwelling ceases to reside at the premises, the reasonable accommodation will remain in effect only if the director determines that: (1) the modification is physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered to comply with this code, or (2) the accommodation is necessary to give another disabled individual an equal opportunity to enjoy the dwelling. The director may request that any successor-in-interest to the property provide documentation that subsequent occupants are persons with disabilities. Failure to provide such documentation within ten days of the date of a request by the director will result in the termination of a previously approved reasonable accommodation and the applicable premises must subsequently be made to conform to code.

Such application shall set forth the name and address of the applicant, description of the property to which the application applies, a statement of the particular provisions for which relief is sought, and the reasons therefor. Such application shall be considered by the planning commission and it shall hear and consider all evidence and testimony that may be presented in support of or in opposition to such application. Upon finding that good cause has been shown and that the strict enforcement of Sections 16.20.010 through 16.20.030 of this code would not be consistent with the general purposes of the sections and that there are practical difficulties or unreasonable hardships which would result from the enforcement of the provisions, the planning commission, under such conditions as it deems necessary to assure that the spirit and purpose of Sections 16.20.010 through 16.20.030 will be observed, may grant in each case such relief from the provisions of such sections as in the determination of the commission will secure the maximum compliance with the provisions of the sections without injustice to the applicant.

The written notice of appeal must be accompanied by an administrative fee in an amount determined by city council resolution. The city council shall consider such appeal and hear and consider all evidence and testimony that may be presented in support of such petition or in opposition to the petition. If the city council finds that good cause has been shown and that to require strict compliance with the provisions of Sections 16.20.010 through 16.20.030 would be unjust or would effect results inconsistent with the general purposes of the sections or that there are practical difficulties and unreasonable hardships which would result from strict compliance with the sections, the council may, under such conditions as it deems necessary to assure that the spirit and purpose of Sections 16.20.010 through 16.20.030 will be observed, grant in each case such relief from the provisions of these sections as in the determination of the council will assure the maximum compliance with the provisions of such sections without injustice to the applicant. The decision of the city council shall be conclusive and written notice of the decision of the city council shall be mailed to the applicant at the address shown on the application.

Chapter 16.34 - FLOOD DAMAGE PROTECTION  
Article I. - Findings, Purposes and Definitions. 
 
16.34.100 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which might result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which would adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  Such flood losses could be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in special flood hazard areas which increase flood heights and velocities, and when improvements are inadequately anchored, may cause damage in other areas from floatable objects. Developments that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage could also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 647 § 1 (part), 1988: Ord. 616 § 1 (part), 1986.)  
16.34.110 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
A.  To protect human life and health; 
B.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
G.  To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 647 § 1 (part), 1988: Ord. 616 § 1 (part), 1986.)  
16.34.120 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purpose, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
A.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

3.  The proposed development adversely affects the flood-carrying capacity of the area of special flood hazard (for purposes of this chapter, "adversely affected" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point), and until a regulatory floodway is designated, new construction will not increase the base flood elevation by more than one foot; 
4.  The flood discharge exiting the development after construction is more or less than the flood discharge at the location prior to development where downstream impacts are probable; 
5.  All necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. 
B.  Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 16.34.200, the director shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize the best base flood data available from any source (federal, state or other), such as high water mark(s), floods of record, or private engineering reports, until such data has been provided by the Federal Insurance Administration, in order to administer Article IV of this chapter and provide the developer with an estimated base flood elevation. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption. 
C.  Information to be Obtained and Maintained. The director shall obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed for flood insurance policies: 
1.  The certification required in Sections 16.34.400C1 through C3, 16.34.430 and 16.34.440D. 
2.  Certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, flood-proofed elevation, or the elevation of the structure's lowest horizontal member is required at that point where the footings are set and slab constructed. Failure to submit elevation certification shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project. As-built plans certifying the elevation (based on U.S.G.S., M.S.L.) of the lowest adjacent grade are also required. 
3.  If fill is used to elevate a structure above the base flood elevation, the permit holder may wish to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), as set forth in Section 16.34.560. 
D.  Alteration of Watercourses. Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or relocated, it is the responsibility of the director to: 
1.  Notify adjacent communities, the Ventura County Flood Control District and the State Coordinating Agency prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and to send evidence of such notifications to the Federal Insurance Administration; 
2.  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within any altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
E.  Interpretation of Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Boundaries. The director shall provide interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 16.34.500B.

2.  The committee shall hold a public hearing within forty-five days of the completed application for a work permit for construction and reconstruction, alteration, restoration and rehabilitation, relocation, and demolition. This hearing may be continued from time to time if necessary. In cases of demolition, the committee may delay the hearing for up to six months for purposes of negotiation as provided for in subsection C3d of this section. 
3.  The director of planning and community development or his designee shall approve an application requesting a permit for ordinary repair and maintenance if such application demonstrates to the director's or his designee's satisfaction that the proposed activities will not involve a change in design, material, or external appearance of the landmark. A clear photograph of the building or structure to be repaired, a brief description of the intended work, and samples of replacement materials or paint for comparison with the existing building or structure must be furnished with the application. 
C.  Permit Criteria. 
1.  Alteration, Restoration, and Rehabilitation. The committee, or the city council upon appeal, shall issue an approval for any proposed actions affecting a landmark, except demolition and relocation if, and only if, it determines: 
a.  The proposed work will not detrimentally alter, destroy or adversely affect any exterior architectural feature or any other feature which led the historic resource to be designated as a landmark; and 
b.  In the case of construction of a new improvement upon a landmark or landmark site, the exterior of such improvements will not adversely affect and will be compatible with the external appearance of existing improvements on said landmark or landmark site. 
2.  Relocation of Landmarks. In considering whether to recommend approval or disapproval of an application for a permit to relocate a landmark, the committee shall be guided by the following considerations: 
a.  The historic character and aesthetic interest the setting contributes to the landmark; 
b.  Whether the landmark can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; and 
c.  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the landmark. 
3.  Demolition of Landmarks. 
a.  Economic Hardship. Demolition of a landmark constitutes an irreplaceable loss to the quality and character of the city. Therefore, no permit shall be issued for demolition of a landmark unless the applicant shows clear and convincing evidence of unreasonable economic hardship: 
b.  Balancing Required. The committee shall be guided in its determination by balancing the historic value of the particular landmark against the merit of the proposed replacement project. 
c.  Approval of Permit. Should the applicant for demolition satisfy the committee that an unreasonable hardship will be suffered if a demolition permit is not approved, or, in failing to demonstrate unreasonable economic hardship, the applicant demonstrates unusual and compelling circumstances which dictate demolition of the landmark, the committee shall approve the application for a demolition permit. 
d.  Negotiations Prior to Demolition Application Decision. 
i.  Prior to the committee's decision on the demolition permit for a landmark, the planning department shall discuss the proposed demolition informally with the applicant, other city officials and local preservation organizations, to explore whether an alternative to demolition can be found before a formal consideration of the application by the committee. The planning department shall prepare a report for the committee analyzing alternatives to demolition, and request from other city departments or agencies information necessary for the preparation of this report. 
ii.  The negotiation period may take up to six months before the request for a demolition permit is brought to the committee. This time period may be further extended by mutual consent of the city and the applicant. 
iii.  If within this period any one of the following three events occur, the demolition application shall be considered to have been withdrawn by the applicant: 
(A)  The owner enters into a binding contract for the sale of the building or structure; 
(B)  Approved arrangements are made for the building or structure to be moved to an approved new location; or 
(C)  The city determines to condemn the property and take it by power of eminent domain for rehabilitation or reuse by the city, or other disposition with appropriate preservation restrictions in order to promote the historic preservation purposes of this chapter to maintain the building or structure and protect it from demolition. 
D.  Showing of Hardship. 
1.  When a claim of unreasonable economic hardship is made due to the effect of this chapter, the owner and/or applicant must prove to the committee, or city council on appeal, that a reasonable return cannot be realized upon the value of the building or structure. The public benefits obtained from retaining the historic resource must be analyzed and duly considered by the committee. 
2.  The committee may require that an applicant furnish information additional to what was submitted that is relevant to its determination of unreasonable economic hardship. The committee may also furnish additional information as the committee believes is relevant. The committee shall also state which form of financial proof it deems relevant and necessary to a particular case. 
3.  Evidence which may be considered in determining whether unreasonable economic hardship exists, includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
a.  Bona fide efforts to rent or sell the building or structure have been unsuccessful; 
b.  Approval or conditional approval to do work permitted by this chapter will not enable the applicant to rent or sell the building or structure at a reasonable rate of return; 
c.  It is not economically or technically feasible to renovate or undertake an alternative development compatible with the permit criteria outlined in this chapter; 
d.  Personal or economic circumstances exist which preclude the applicant from performing work in compliance with the permit criteria outlined in this chapter; 
e.  Land use regulations and development standards, set forth in the city's zoning ordinance and the Uniform Building Code, preclude necessary renovations or a feasible use of the landmark. 
E.  Appeal ProcedureDirector's Action. 
1.

The notice of appeal shall indicate the grounds for the appeal. 
2.  The committee shall schedule a public hearing to be held no later than thirty days after the notice of appeal is filed and shall render its decision within thirty days of closing the public hearing. 
3.  In ruling upon the appeal, the committee shall consider the same factors as the director, the report of the city or the director, and any other matters presented at the hearing on the appeal. If the committee approves the application, it shall direct the director of planning and community development to issue a permit for the work covered. If the committee disapproves the application, it shall direct the director of planning and community development not to issue such permit. Such disapproval may indicate what changes in the plans and specifications would meet the conditions for protecting the distinctive historical character of the landmark. 
4.  The decision of the committee may be appealed as provided for in subsection F of this section. 
F.  Appeal ProcedureCommittee's Action. 
1.  An applicant may appeal the committee's decision to the city council by filing a written appeal directed to the council with the city clerk within ten days from the date of action by the committee. The notice of appeal shall indicate the grounds for the appeal. 
2.  The city council shall schedule a public hearing to be held no later than thirty days after the notice of appeal is filed and shall render its decision within thirty days of closing the public hearing. 
3.  In ruling upon the appeal, the city council shall consider the same factors as the committee, the report of the city or the director, and any other matters presented at the hearing on the appeal. If the city council approves the application, it shall direct the director of planning and community development to issue a permit for the work covered. If the city council disapproves the application, it shall direct the director of planning and community development not to issue such permit.

(Ord. 670 § 1 (part), 1989.)  
Chapter 16.46 - POLICE FACILITIES FEE 
 
16.46.010 - Findings. 
A.  The city authorized a study addressing the need for a new police facility within the city. In November, 1986, the city was presented with a report by Steinmann, Grayson, Smylie on the need for new police facilities and staffing needs for the Camarillo police department through the year 2005 (the "report"). This report was updated by the Planning Collective Limited in September, 1989 (the "update"). 
B.  The report and the update indicate that there has been a steady increase for police service calls resulting in a demand for increased space and additional staff to ensure that the police functions can be carried out in a responsible manner. Based on the projected growth for the city through the year 2005, the police facility located on Palm Drive has been determined to be inadequate in size and structure and it has been determined that there will be a need to increase staff size. Therefore, the establishment of a new police facility and the imposition of a fee on new development to fund that portion of the new police facility and the imposition of a fee on new development to fund that portion of the new police facility attributable to new development is necessary in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the present and future citizens of Camarillo, and those who work and will work in the city. 
C.  The update recommends that the city acquire at least four acres and construct a facility of approximately twenty-two thousand eight hundred gross square feet, including an emergency operating center, with parking for approximately one hundred twenty-five to one hundred fifty vehicles within the Flynn Road Industrial area. 
D.  The city council has examined and generally concurs with the recommendations of the report, as modified by the update. Based upon the report, the update, and the options available for development of a new police facility in the near future, the city council has selected and purchased an alternate site near Flynn Road which consists of an existing building of approximately twenty-seven thousand seven hundred square feet with one hundred eighty parking spaces. The city council has retained an architectural firm to redesign the building to serve as a police facility, including an emergency operating center. 
E.  The city council has determined that in order to build the police facility in a timely manner, it is necessary to finance new development's share of the costs. As financing will result in an additional monetary expenditure which increases the cost of the police facility, the city council has determined that it is proper to include the financing costs of the portion attributable to new development in the fee. 
F.  Camarillo contracts with the Ventura County sheriff's department for police services. 
(Ord. 796 § 1 (part), 1993: Ord. 697 § 1 (part), 1989.)  
16.46.020 - Police facility fee. 
A.  There shall be a police facility fee imposed on all new industrial, commercial and residential development in the city in an amount to be determined by a resolution duly adopted by the city council. 
B.  The resolution setting forth the police facility fee shall take into account the portion of the new police facility attributable to new development, the distribution of police calls to the various types of land uses, and the total cost of the new police facility, including acquisition, redesign, construction and financing costs. 
C.  The police facility fee shall be used solely to pay for that portion of the costs attributable to new development for acquiring, redesigning, and constructing the new police facility in the city, including financing costs. 
D.  It is reasonable to impose a police facility fee on all new development in the city as all new development places an increased burden on police services and causes a need for increased staff and increased space and all new development benefits from adequate police service. 
E.  It is reasonable to include the amount of financing the new police facility in the police facility fee as it would be impossible to establish a new police facility prior to building out of the existing general plan without financing such facility and absent such financing, police service would become inadequate in the interim causing a detriment to the public health, safety and welfare of those who live and work in the city. 
(Ord. 796 § 1 (part), 1993: Ord. 697 § 1 (part), 1989.)  
16.46.030 - Payment of police facility fee. 
Except as otherwise provided by law, the police facility fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of any building permit. 
(Ord. 796 § 1 (part), 1993: Ord. 697 § 1 (part), 1989.)  
16.46.040 - Waiver. 
The city council may waive all or part of the police facility fee for low and moderate income housing upon the request of the developer. 
(Ord. 796 § 1 (part), 1993: Ord. 697 § 1 (part), 1989.)  
Chapter 16.50 - FIRE PROTECTION FACILITIES FEE 
 
16.50.010 - Purpose. 
New construction within the city will create a need for additional fire protection services and a corresponding need for additional or enlarged fire stations from which to provide those services. The Ventura County Fire Protection District which provides fire protection services to the city has primary responsibility for providing the additional fire protection services, but its tax revenues are insufficient to provide the corresponding additional or enlarged fire stations and it is questionable whether the fire district has authority to directly impose a fee on new construction for such purposes. The city does have authority to impose such a fee and it is in the interest of the city to ensure that the fire district has sufficient funds to pay for the needed new or enlarged fire stations. The purpose of this chapter is to impose on new construction within the city, and to transfer to the fire district, a fee in an amount sufficient to reimburse the fire district for that new construction's estimated pro rata share of the cost to the fire district of providing the additional or enlarged fire stations. 
(Ord. 771 § 1 (part), 1992.)  
16.50.020 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them below. 
"Building official" means the district supervisor of the department of building and safety in the city, or such person's designee. 
"Fire district" means the Ventura County Fire Protection District. 
"Fire station" means a building (including furnishings and fixtures), site, and appurtenant equipment (including vehicles) which are designed, developed and used to provide the full spectrum of fire protection services (excepting central administration services, air unit services, hand crew services, dispatch services, repair shop services, and central training services provided out of buildings located at the Ventura County Airport at Camarillo) to a given service area. 
"Floor space" means "floor area" as the latter term is defined in Section 407 of the 1991 Uniform Building Code, or the most recent amendment thereto. 
"New construction," when applied to the construction of residential buildings or the installation of mobilehomes, means construction or installation which increases the number of dwelling units on a given lot or parcel. "New construction," when applied to the construction of nonresidential buildings means construction which increases the total square footage of a structure on a given lot or parcel. 
A fire station or group of fire stations is "overextended" when, as determined by resolution of the city council, the estimated population of the station's or group's service area exceeds, or the projected population of the service area will at any time within the following eight years exceed, the maximum number of people which the station or group of stations can adequately serve. 
The "service area" for a given fire station or group of fire stations is that geographical area within the fire district, including both incorporated and unincorporated territory, within which the station or group of stations is located and to which the station or group of stations is the primary provider of fire protection services. The precise boundaries of a given service area shall be determined by resolution of the city council based upon information provided by the fire district. 
"Standard fire station" means a fire station designed to the fire district's specifications, containing five thousand seven hundred square feet of floor space, and having as appurtenant equipment one new fire engine and one reserve fire engine. 
(Ord. 771 § 1 (part), 1992.)  
16.50.030 - Fire protection facilities fee. 
Within the incorporated portion of any service area for which the existing fire station or group of fire stations is overextended, a fire protection facilities fee computed pursuant to this chapter shall be imposed upon the issuance of any building permit for new construction. Except as otherwise provided by Government Code Section 66007, the fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit or, in the case of a mobilehome, prior to the issuance of a mobilehome set-up permit. 
(Ord. 771 § 1 (part), 1992.)  
16.50.040 - Computation of fee for residential construction. 
A.  The amount of the fire protection facilities fee to be paid pursuant to Section 16.50.030 with respect to the construction of residential buildings or the installation of mobilehomes shall be the dollar amount equal to "X" in the following formula: 
X = ACD / B 
where: 
"A" equals the estimated cost of acquiring a standard fire station, excluding land acquisition costs, but including site preparation and landscaping costs; 
"B" equals the maximum number of people who can be served adequately by a standard fire station; 
"C" equals the estimated average number of people who will reside in each dwelling unit in the buildings or mobilehomes for which the permit is issued, multiplied by a number equal to the number of dwelling units which will be contained in such buildings or mobilehomes after construction, minus, in cases where the construction is the replacement or modification of existing buildings or mobilehomes, the number of dwelling units contained in such buildings or mobilehomes immediately prior to construction; and 
"D" equals the estimated portion, expressed as a decimal, of the standard fire station needed to provide service to residential buildings and mobilehomes, as opposed to nonresidential buildings. 
B.  The specific number values to be assigned to "A," "B" and "D" in the foregoing formula, and the estimated average number of people per dwelling unit for the purpose of computing the value "C" in the foregoing formula, shall be determined by resolution of the city council from time to time on the basis of evidence submitted to it. 
C.  With respect to residential buildings or mobilehomes constructed or installed within a subdivision for which the tentative map was approved subject to the condition that the subdivider donate fire protection facilities, a credit shall be given against the fee on account of such donated facilities which are accepted by the fire district. For the purposes of this section, unfinished facilities shall be deemed to have been "accepted" by the fire district if such facilities are to be completed pursuant to a secured improvement agreement made in accordance with Section 66462 of the Government Code. The amount of the credit shall be determined as follows: 
1.  The fair market value of the donated and accepted facilities, excluding the land therefor, as of the date on which the final or parcel map was recorded shall be determined by written agreement of the chief of the fire district and the subdivider or applicant or, if they should fail to agree, by an independent appraiser selected by the chief of the fire district and paid for by the subdivider or applicant. 
2.  The estimated number of people who will reside in the entire subdivision when it is fully developed will be determined by multiplying the number of dwelling units proposed for the subdivision by the estimated average number of people who will reside in each unit and then adding the products. The estimated average number of people who will reside in each dwelling unit shall be the same as that used to calculate the value of "C" in the foregoing formula. 
3.  A fair market value as determined pursuant to subsection C 1 of this section shall then be divided by the estimated number of people who will reside in the entire subdivision as determined pursuant to subsection C 2 of this section. 
4.  The estimated number of people who will reside in the unit to be constructed or installed shall be multiplied by the quotient determined pursuant to subsection C 3 of this section. A credit for that unit shall be the dollar amount equal to the product; provided, however, that the amount of the credit shall not exceed the amount of the fee. 
(Ord. 771 § 1 (part), 1992.)  
16.50.050 - Computation of fee for nonresidential construction. 
A.  The amount of the fire protection facilities fee to be paid pursuant to Section 16.50.030 with respect to the construction of a nonresidential building shall be the dollar amount equal to "Y" in the following formula: 
Y = AFG / E 
where: 
"A" equals the number value assigned to "A" for the purpose of Section 16.50.040; 
"E" equals the maximum square footage of nonresidential building floor space which can be served adequately by a standard fire station; 
"F" equals the number of square feet of floor space in the building for which the building permit is issued minus, in cases where the construction is the replacement or modification of an existing building, the number of square feet of floor space in such existing building immediately prior to such replacement or modification; and 
"G" equals the number one minus the number value assigned to "D" for the purposes of Section 16.50.040. 
B.  The specific number values to be assigned to "E" in the foregoing formula shall be determined by resolution of the city council from time to time on the basis of evidence submitted to it. 
C.  With respect to buildings constructed for use pursuant to a conditional use permit or other similar entitlement that was approved subject to the condition that the permittee donate fire protection facilities, a credit shall be given against the fee on account of such donated facilities which are accepted by the fire district. For the purposes of this section, unfinished facilities shall be deemed to have been "accepted" by the fire district if such facilities are to be completed pursuant to a secured improvement agreement made in accordance with Section 66462 of the Government Code. The amount of the credit shall be determined as follows: 
1.  The fair market value of the donated and accepted facilities, excluding the land therefor, as of the date on which the conditional use permit or other similar entitlement was approved shall be determined by written agreement of the chief of the fire district and the permittee or applicant or, if they should fail to agree, by an independent appraiser selected by the chief of the fire district and paid for by the permittee or applicant; 
2.  A fair market value as determined pursuant to subsection C 1 shall then be divided by the estimated number of square feet of floor space in all existing and proposed buildings that will be used pursuant to the conditional use permit or other similar entitlement; 
3.  The value of "F" in the foregoing formula computed with respect to the building for which the building permit is issued shall be multiplied by the quotient determined pursuant to subsection C 2 of this section. A credit for that building shall be the dollar amount equal to the product; provided, however, that the amount of the credit shall not exceed the amount of the fee. 
(Ord. 771 § 1 (part), 1992.)  
16.50.060 - Use of fire protection facilities fee. 
All fire protection facilities fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be forwarded to the fire district on a periodic basis but no later than ninety calendar days after collection. All fees so forwarded shall be deposited in a restricted account of the fire district within the county treasury and all moneys deposited in such account together with any interest earned thereon shall be used only for the purposes of acquiring or improving fire stations serving the service area, or portions thereof, from which the fees were collected, subject to the refund provisions of Section 16.50.070. 
(Ord. 771 § 1 (part), 1992.)  
16.50.070 - Refund of fee.

Subject to the consent of the property owner or person in control or possession of the property, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted for all or part of the commercial or noncommercial message on any sign allowed under this chapter. No special or additional approval is required to substitute a noncommercial message for any other message on a permitted sign, provided the sign structure is already approved or exempt from the sign permit requirement and no structural or electrical change is made. When a noncommercial message is substituted for any other message; however, the sign is still subject to the same design, locational and structural regulations (e.g., color, materials, size, height, illumination, maintenance, duration of display etc.) as well as all building and electrical code requirements, as would apply, if the sign were used to display a commercial message. In the event of any perceived or actual conflict between the general provisions of this subsection and any other specific provisions in this chapter, the provisions of this subsection will prevail. 
E.  Substitution of Commercial Messages. The substitution of one commercial message for another commercial message is not automatically allowed nor is the free substitution of a commercial message in a place where only a noncommercial message is allowed. In addition, no off-site commercial messages may be substituted for on-site commercial messages. 
F.  Legal Nature of Sign Rights and Duties. All rights, duties and responsibilities related to permanent signs attach to the land on which the sign is erected or displayed and run with the land or personal property. The city may demand compliance with this chapter and with the terms of any sign permit from the permit holder, the owner of the sign, the property owner or person in control or possession of the property, or the person erecting the sign.

An application shall be approved whenever the proposed sign conforms to all design, size, height and other standards for signs subject to a permit requirement; as such requirements are set forth in this chapter. 
3.  The director may refer certain sign permit applications to the planning commission for review. Such determination should be made within ten days of a complete application and acted upon by the planning commission within sixty days or concurrent with any related and required project approval that is presented to the planning commission. The planning commission's approval may be conditional so as to ensure compliance with the purposes and provisions of this chapter. 
4.  An application may be granted either in whole or in part when more than one sign or location is proposed by an applicant.

D.  Sign Permit Review: Master Sign Programs, Modifications and Variances. 
1.  Master Sign Programs. The director has the authority to authorize master sign programs with specific design standards to enable reasonable flexibility for unique circumstances and special design themes. 
2.  Modifications. The director may grant slight modifications in or approve signs deviating from the provisions of this chapter or any limitations imposed upon the use or general design of the sign and may authorize modifications from the permitted sign area, height or setback requirements not to exceed ten percent. Before granting any such minor modification, the director must make the applicable variance findings as set forth in Chapter 19.66 of this code. 
3.  Variances. The planning commission may grant variances from the provisions of this chapter for the erection and maintenance of signs when difficulties, unnecessary hardship or results inconsistent with the general purpose of this chapter would otherwise occur and would deprive the owner of rights enjoyed by others.

4.  All signs authorized under this chapter must be placed on the side of the property facing on a public or private right-of-way. 
B.  Sign Height. Sign height will be measured using the greatest vertical measurement from grade level along the base of the sign structure to the highest point of the sign. 
C.  Sign Area. The surface area of any sign face will be computed from the smallest rectangles, circles or triangles which will enclose all words, letters, figures, symbols, designs and pictures, together with all framing, background material, colored or illuminated areas, and attention-attracting devices forming an integral part of the overall display, but excluding all support structures, except that: 
1.  Superficial ornamentation or symbol-type appendages of a nonmessage-bearing character which do not exceed five percent of the surface area will be exempted from computation. 
2.  Wall signs painted on or affixed directly to a building wall, facade or roof, and having no discernible boundary, will have the areas between letters, words intended to be read together, and any device intended to draw attention to the sign message included in any computation of surface area. 
3.  Signs placed in such a manner, or bearing a text, as to require dependence upon each other in order to convey meaning will be considered one sign and the intervening areas between signs included in any computation of surface area. 
4.  Spherical, cylindrical or other three-dimensional signs not having conventional sign faces will be computed from the smallest three-dimensional geometrical shape or shapes which will best approximate the actual surface area of such faces up to an eight-sided shape.

In the case of an unsafe sign removed by the city, the costs of such removal and storage shall be borne by the permit holder, property owner, or person in possession and control of the property, as applicable, and may be collected by the city in the same manner as it collects any other debt or obligation.

The owner or user may maintain the sign at the premises and at a location necessary for continued public visibility at the height or size at which the sign was previously lawfully erected pursuant to all applicable codes, regulations and permits. Any such sign will be deemed to be in conformance with this chapter.

E.  Hearing. The department shall expeditiously schedule a hearing before the planning commission or city council, as applicable, not later than thirty days after the notice of appeal is received by the city and give written notice of the time and place of the hearing to the appellant; provided, however, the hearing may be held after such thirty-day period upon the request or concurrence of the appellant. Action on the appeal shall be taken at the time of the hearing by the planning commission or city council, as applicable, unless the appellant requests a continuance.

In the absence of that agreement, the city may require fulfillment of the construction requirements, including the payment of fees associated with any deferred improvements, within a reasonable time following approval of the final map and prior to the issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for the development of a remainder parcel upon a finding by the city that fulfillment of the construction requirements is necessary for reasons of: 
a.  The public health and safety; or 
b.  The required construction is a necessary prerequisite to the orderly development of the surrounding area. 
C.  As an alternative to designating a remainder, if the subdivider elects to omit all or a portion of any unit of improved or unimproved land which is not divided for the purpose of sale, lease, or financing, the omitted portion shall not be counted as a parcel for purposes of determining whether a parcel or final map is required, and the fulfillment of construction requirements for offsite improvements, including the payment of fees associated with any deferred improvements, shall not be required until a permit or other grant of approval for development is issued on the omitted parcel, except where allowed pursuant to subsection (B)(2) of this section. 
D.  The provisions of subsections (B) and (C) of this section, providing for deferral of the payment of fees associated with any deferred improvements, shall not apply if the designated remainder or omitted parcel is included within the boundaries of a benefit assessment district or community facilities district. 
E.  A designated remainder or any omitted parcel may subsequently be sold without any further requirement of the filing of a parcel map or final map, but the city may require a certificate of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance.

D.  If no action is taken by the city council within the time limit as specified, the tentative map as filed shall be deemed to be approved, insofar as it complies with other applicable provisions of the State Subdivision Map Act, this title and other city ordinances, and it shall be the duty of the city clerk to certify or state his or her approval. 
(Ord. 678 § 9, 1989; Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)  
18.10.110 - Denial. 
The tentative subdivision map may be denied by the city council for failure to comply with city ordinances, resolutions or standards, or the state Subdivision Map Act. The city council shall deny approval of the tentative map if it makes any of the following findings: 
A.  The proposed map fails to meet or perform any of the requirements or conditions imposed by the Subdivision Map Act or this title; 
B.  That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans; 
C.  That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans; 
D.  That the site is not physically suitable for the type of development; 
E.  That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of the development; 
F.  That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat; 
G.  That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements is likely to cause serious public health problems; 
H.  That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of, property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the governing body may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements for access or for use will be provided, and that these will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and no authority is granted to a legislative body to determine that the public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision; 
I.  Williamson Land Act. 
1.  The land is subject to a contract entered into pursuant to the California Land Conservation Act of 1965 (Government Code Section 51200 et seq.) and that the resulting parcels following a subdivision of that land would be too small to sustain their agricultural use. For purposes of this section, land shall be presumed to be in parcels too small to sustain their agricultural use if the land is: 
a.  Less than ten acres in size in the case of prime agricultural land; or 
b.  Less than forty acres in size in the case of land which is not prime agricultural land. 
For purpose of this section, agricultural land shall be presumed to be in parcels large enough to sustain their agricultural use if the land is: 
a.  At least ten acres in size in the case of prime agricultural land; or 
b.  At least forty acres in size in the case of land which is not prime agricultural land. 
2.  A subdivision with parcels smaller than those specified in this section may be approved if either of the following findings are made: 
a.  The parcels can nevertheless sustain an agricultural use permitted under the contract, or are subject to a written agreement for joint management pursuant to Government Code Section 51230.1, provided that the parcels which are jointly managed total at least ten acres in size in the case of prime agricultural land or forty acres in size in the case of land which is not prime agricultural land. 
b.  One of the parcels contains a residence and is subject to Section 428 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; the residence has existed on the property for at least five years; the landowner has owned the parcels for at least ten years; and the remaining parcels shown on the map are at least ten acres in size if the land is prime agricultural land, or at least forty acres in size if the land is not prime agricultural land. In such case, no other homesite parcels may be created on any remaining parcels under contract for at least ten years following the creation of a homesite parcel pursuant to this section. 
3.  This subsection shall not apply to land which is subject to a contract when any of the following has occurred: 
a.  A local agency formation commission has approved the annexation of the land to the city and the city will not succeed to the contract as provided in Government Code Sections 51243 and 51243.5; 
b.  Written notice of nonrenewal of the contract has been served prior to March 7, 1985, as provided in Government Code Section 51245; 
c.  Written notice of nonrenewal of the contract has been served on or after March 7, 1985, as provided in Government Code Section 51245, and, as a result of that notice, there are no more than three years remaining in the term of the contract; 
d.  The board or council has granted tentative approval for cancellation of the contract as provided in Section 51282. 
4.  This section shall not be construed as limiting the power of the city to establish minimum parcel sizes larger than those specified in subsection I(1) of this section, on a case-by-case basis. 
(Ord. 810 § 11, 1994; Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)  
18.10.120 - Dedication of streets, alleys and other public rights-of-way or easements. 
As a condition of approval of a final map, the subdivider shall dedicate or make an irrevocable offer of dedication of land within the subdivision that is needed for streets and alleys, including access and the abutters' rights, drainage, public greenways, scenic easements, bicycle paths if the subdivision contains two hundred or more parcels, public utility easements, and other public easements. In addition, the subdivider shall improve or agree to improve all streets and alleys, including access rights and the abutters' rights, drainage, public utility easements, and other public easements. The improvements and dedication shall be in accordance with the provisions of this title. All water, sanitary and storm drain easements shall be a minimum of twenty feet in width unless modified by the city council. 
(Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)  
18.10.130 - Dedication of land for transit facilities. 
A.  As a condition of approval of a final map, the subdivider shall dedicate or make an irrevocable offer of dedication of land within the subdivision for local transit facilities such as bus turnouts, benches, shelters, landing pads and similar items which directly benefit the residents of a subdivision if: 
1.  The subdivision as shown on the tentative map has the potential for two hundred dwelling units or more if developed to maximum density shown on the adopted general plan, or contains one hundred acres or more; and 
2.  The city council finds that transit services are or will within a reasonable time period be made available to such subdivision. 
B.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision or airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than five years old when no new dwelling units are added. 
(Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)  
18.10.135 - Cable access. 
As a condition of approval of a final map, the subdivider shall provide access to all cable operators within the city. 
(Ord. 678 § 10, 1989.)  
18.10.140 - Extension of time for planning commission or city council action. 
The time limits set forth in this chapter for acting on the tentative map may be extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the planning commission or the city council. 
(Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)  
18.10.150 - Expiration of tentative subdivision maps. 
A.  The approval or conditional approval of a tentative subdivision map shall expire twenty-four months from the date of the adoption of the resolution of the city council approving or conditionally approving the map. However, if the subdivider is subject to a requirement of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars or more to construct, improve, or finance the construction or improvement of public improvements outside the boundaries of the tentative map, excluding improvements of public rights-of-way which abut the boundary of the property to be subdivided and which are reasonably related to the development of that property, each filing of a final map authorized by Government Code Section 66456.1 shall extend the expiration of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map by thirty-six months from the date of its expiration, as provided in this section, or the date of the previously filed final map whichever is later. The extensions shall not extend the tentative map more than ten years from its approval or conditional approval. A tentative map on property subject to a development agreement authorized by Government Code Section 65864, et seq. may be extended, for the period of time provided for in the agreement, but not beyond the duration for the agreement. 
B.  The period of time specified in subsection (A) of this section, including any extension granted pursuant to Section 18.10.160, shall not include any period of time in which a development moratorium is in existence in accordance with Government Code Section 66452.6. 
C.  The period of time specified in subsection (A) of this section, including any extension granted pursuant to Section 18.10.160, shall not include any period of time during which a lawsuit has been filed and is pending in a court of competent jurisdiction involving the approval, or conditional approval, of a tentative map only if a stay of the time period is approved by the city council. After service of the initial petition or complaint upon the city, the subdivider may in writing, to the director of planning and community development, request a stay of the time period of the tentative map. Within forty days after receiving such request, the city council shall either stay the time period for up to five years or deny the requested stay. The request for the stay shall be acted upon after a hearing has been held following notice to the subdivider. 
D.  Expiration of an approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall terminate all proceedings and no final map or parcel map of all or any portion of the real property included within such tentative map shall be filed without first processing a new tentative map. However, if a map which is ready for recordation is submitted to the city engineer prior to the expiration date, the city may process, approve and record the map after the expiration date. Delivery to the city engineer shall be deemed a timely filing for purposes of this section. 
(Ord. 810 § 12, 1994: Ord. 678 § 11, 1989; Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)  
18.10.160 - Extensions of tentative subdivision maps. 
A.  The subdivider may request an extension of the approved or conditionally approved tentative subdivision map, not exceeding a total of three years, by written application to the planning and community development department. The application shall be filed prior to the expiration of the map as determined by Section 18.10.150 and shall state the reasons for requesting the extension. The period of extension specified in this section is in addition to the period of time provided for in Section 18.10.150 (A). Upon a timely request for extension, the map shall automatically be extended for sixty days or until the application for the extension is approved, conditionally approved, or denied by the city council, whichever occurs first. 
B.  The director of planning and community development shall review the request and submit the application for the extension, together with a report, to the city council for approval, conditional approval or denial. The resolution adopted by the city council approving or conditionally approving an extension shall specify the new expiration date of the tentative subdivision map. The hearing shall be noticed in the same manner as the original approval hearing. 
C.  No more than three extensions shall be approved for a tentative map and the period of each extension shall not exceed twelve months. The extension of time shall commence with the expiration date of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map. The approved new expiration date shall not extend more than three years beyond the original expiration date of the tentative subdivision map. 
D.  As a condition of the extension of a tentative subdivision map, the city council may recommend new conditions or revise existing conditions on the approved tentative map as recommended by the planning and community development or as it may find necessary, provided the developer agrees to these conditions or revisions. 
E.  The fee for processing an extension shall be as provided by city council resolution. 
(Ord. 810 § 13, 1994; Ord. 678 § 12, 1989; Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)

A.  Minor changes in the tentative map may be approved by the planning and community development director upon application by the subdivider on its own initiative, provided: 
1.  No lots, units or building sites are added; 
2.  Such changes are consistent with the intent and spirit of the original tentative map approval; 
3.  There are no resulting violations of this code. 
B.  Any revision shall be approved by the director of planning and community development. The amendment shall be indicated on the approved map and certified by the director of planning and community development. 
C.  Amendments of the tentative map other than minor shall be presented to the planning commission and city council for approval. Processing shall be in accordance with Sections 18.10.050 and 18.10.080. 
D.  Any approved amendment or modification shall not alter the expiration date of the tentative map. 
(Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)  
Chapter 18.12 - VESTING TENTATIVE MAPS 
Sections: 
 
18.12.000 - Development rights. 
A.  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confirm a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards of the city in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A, a permit, approval, extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined: 
1.  A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both. 
2.  The condition or denial is required in order to comply with the state or federal law. 
C.  Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned upon the subdivider or his or her designee obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Section 18.10.180A, confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map as approved. The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time period set forth in Section 18.10.180A. 
D.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the property owner or his or her designee may seek approvals or permits for the development which depart from the ordinances, policies and standards described in Section 18.10.180A and B, and these approvals may be made to the extent that such departures are authorized under applicable law. 
E.  The rights conferred by this section shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map. If the final map is approved, the rights conferred by this section shall be subject to the periods of time set forth in Section 18.10.050B and C. 
F.  Consistent with Subsection A above, an approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall not limit the city from imposing reasonable conditions on subsequent required approvals or permits necessary for the development and authorized by the ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
(Ord. 678 § 13, 1989: Ord. 603 § 2 (part), 1986: Ord. 602 § 2 (part), 1985.)  
18.12.010 - Citation and authority. 
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 66498.1) of Division 2 of Title 7 of the Government Code of the state of California. 
(Ord. 678 § 14, 1989: Ord. 603 § 2 (part), 1986: Ord. 602 § 2 (part), 1985.)  
18.12.020 - Purpose and intent. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to establish procedures necessary for the implementation of the vesting tentative map statute as described in Section 18.12.010 and to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and Title 18 of the Camarillo Municipal Code. To accomplish this purpose, the regulations outlined in this chapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development. 
(Ord. 603 § 2 (part), 1986: Ord. 602 § 2 (part), 1985.)  
18.12.030 - Findings. 
The city council finds, determines and declares that: 
A.  The state has determined the necessity for local agencies to permit vesting tentative maps.

Chapter 18.30 - PARK LAND DEDICATION 
Sections: 
 
18.30.010 - General. 
The provisions of this chapter are enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 66477 of the Government Code of the state of California. The park and recreational facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by these sections are in accordance with the definite principles and standards contained in the adopted recreation element of the general plan of the city. 
(Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.) 
(Ord. No. 1156, § 3, 9-26-2018)  
18.30.020 - Requirements. 
A.  As a condition of approval of a tentative subdivision map or land division, the subdivider will dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu to the Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District ("park district"), or both, at the option of the city and after consultation with the park district, for park or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in these sections. If a subdivision has less than fifty parcels, the city may only require the payment of an in lieu fee. However, if the subdivision includes more than fifty dwelling units, dedication of land may be required. 
B.  Subdivisions not used for residential purposes are exempted from the requirements of this section; provided, however, that a condition may be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels within four years, the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit. 
(Ord. 678 § 21, 1989: Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.) 
(Ord. No. 1156, § 3, 9-26-2018)  
18.30.030 - General standard. 
It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that five net acres of property for each one thousand persons (or two hundred seventeen and eight-tenths square feet per person) residing within this city be devoted to local park and recreational purposes and that the amount of the existing neighborhood and community park area as calculated pursuant to this chapter exceeds that limit. 
(Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.) 
(Ord. No. 1156, § 3, 9-26-2018)  
18.30.040 - Standards and formula for dedication of land. 
A.  Where a park or recreational facility has been designated in the city's park and recreation element of the general plan, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider may dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography to serve the residents of the subdivision. 
B.  The amount of land to be dedicated for parks will be two hundred seventeen and eight-tenths square feet for each person anticipated to be living in the development. The number of persons anticipated to be living in the development is calculated by multiplying the number of units within the development of a particular class by the average household size of such class of unit and adding the calculated figures for each class of unit within the development. There is a rebuttable presumption that the average size of each class of household is the same as that disclosed by the most recent available federal census, or census taken pursuant to Government Code section 40200 and following. 
C.  In the event the area to be dedicated is bounded or abutted by existing or proposed street frontage, the subdivider will, at the time of approval of the tentative map or land division, obligate himself by condition to the map to provide curbs, gutters, sidewalk, drainage facilities, street lighting, stoplights, street signs, pavement, six-foot high wall or decorative fence between the park and homes abutting on the park (if needed), and street trees to full city standards. In such event, the subdivider will also obligate the subdivider to stub-in requested utility line services to the parkway and to perform the initial on-site grading required for developing the park facility. The subdivider will bond to guarantee construction of such improvements as part of the land dedication. 
D.  If the subdivider installs any park improvements, such as playground equipment and restrooms, the cost of park and recreational improvements will constitute a credit towards the subdivider's land dedication/in lieu fee requirement. 
(Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.) 
(Ord. No. 1156, § 3, 9-26-2018)  
18.30.050 - Amount of fee in lieu of land dedication. 
A.  When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee will be based upon the fair market value of the amount of usable park land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated pursuant to Section 18.30.040 and will be determined according to the following formula: Number of acres of land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated multiplied by the average fair market value of an acre of usable park land within the subdivision which will be determined as of the time of filing the application of the parcel or final map to the city and which must be consistent with the zoning applicable to the land at that time. Fair market value is determined as follows: 
1.  The fair market value will be determined by the application of accepted appraisal methods upon the advice of the Ventura County assessor; or 
2.  The city, the parks district, and the subdivider may agree to the fair market value: or 
3.  If the subdivider, city, or the parks district objects to the fair market value determined in subsection (1), any party may, at the subdivider's expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by an impartial qualified real estate appraiser approved by the city, which appraisal may be considered as to the fair market value. 
B.  The in-lieu fee will also include an amount sufficient to provide curbs, gutters, drainage facilities, street lights, stop-lights, street signs, sidewalks, pavement and street trees to full city standards, and for stubbing-in of utility services to the park property and initial on-site grading required for developing the park facility or rehabilitation of existing parks.

3.  The existing parcels which exist prior to the proposed conversion were not created by a recorded parcel or final map; or 
4.  The conversion would result in the creation of more condominium units or interests than the number of tenant lots or spaces that exist prior to conversion. 
B.  The petition signed by owners of mobilehomes in a mobilehome park proposed for conversion to resident ownership pursuant to subsection (A) of this section shall read as follows: 
"MOBILEHOME PARK PETITION 
AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT 
SIGNING THIS PETITION INDICATES YOUR SUPPORT FOR CONVERSION OF THIS MOBILEHOME PARK TO RESIDENT OWNERSHIP. THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT CONCERNS THE REAL PROPERTY SITUATED IN THE CITY OF CAMARILLO, COUNTY OF VENTURA, STATE OF CALIFORNIA, DESCRIBED AS _______. THE TOTAL COST FOR CONVERSION AND PURCHASE OF THE PARK IS $_____ TO $_____, EXCLUDING FINANCING COSTS. IF TWO-THIRDS OF THE RESIDENTS IN THIS PARK SIGN THIS PETITION INDICATING THEIR INTENT TO PURCHASE THE MOBILEHOME PARK FOR PURPOSES OF CONVERTING IT TO RESIDENT OWNERSHIP, THEN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A NEW PARCEL, OR TENTATIVE AND FINAL SUBDIVISION MAP IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SUBDIVISION MAP ACT MUST BE WAIVED, WITH CERTAIN VERY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS.

C.  The city shall provide an application for waiver pursuant to this section. After the waiver application is deemed complete pursuant to Government Code Section 65943, the city shall approve or deny the application within fifty days. The applicant shall have the right to appeal that decision to the city council in the case of a parcel map. 
D.  If a tentative or parcel map is required, no off-site design or improvement requirements shall be imposed unless these are necessary to mitigate an existing health or safety condition. No other dedications, improvements, or in-lieu fees shall be required by the city. In no case shall the mitigation of a health or safety condition have the effect of reducing the number, or changing the location, of existing mobilehome spaces. 
E.  If the city imposes requirements on an applicant to mitigate a health or safety condition, the applicant and the city shall enter into an unsecured improvement agreement. The city shall not require bonds or other security devices for the performance of that agreement. The applicant shall have a period of one year from the date the agreement was executed to complete those improvements. 
F.  If the waiver application provided for in this section is denied by the city pursuant to the provisions of subsection (A) of this section, the applicant may proceed to convert the mobilehome park to a tenant-owned, condominium ownership interest, but shall file a parcel map or a tentative and final map. The city may not require the applicant to file and record a tentative and final map unless the conversion creates five or more parcels shown on the map. The number of condominium units or interests created by the conversion shall not determine whether the filing of a parcel or a tentative and final map shall be required. 
G.  For the purposes of this section, "resident ownership" means, depending on the context, either the ownership by a resident organization (as defined in section 50781 of the Health and Safety Code), of an interest in a mobilehome park which entitles the resident organization to control the operations of the mobilehome park for a term of no less than fifteen years, or the ownership of individual interests in a mobilehome park, or both.

K.  Any surplus remaining shall be refunded as follows: 
1.  There shall be refunded to the current owners of the property for which a fee was previously collected, the balance of such moneys in the same proportion which each individual fee collected bears to the total of all individual fees collected from the particular drainage or sewer area; 
2.  Where property for which a fee was previously collected has subsequently been subdivided into more than one lot, each current owner of a lot shall share in the refund payable to the owners of the property for which a fee was previously collected in the same proportion which the area of each individual lot bears to the total area of the property for which a fee was previously collected; and 
3.  There shall be transferred to the general fund of the city any remaining portion of the surplus which has not been paid to or claimed by the persons entitled thereto within two years from the date either of the completion of the improvements, or the adoption by the city council of a resolution declaring a surplus, whichever is later to occur.

Chapter 18.90 - ENFORCEMENT OF TITLE PROVISIONS 
Sections: 
 
18.90.010 - Prohibition. 
A.  No person shall sell, lease, or finance any parcel or parcels of real property or commence construction of any building for sale, lease or financing thereon, except for model homes, or allow occupancy thereof, for which a final map or parcel map is required by this title, or the state Subdivision Map Act, until such map has been filed with the county recorder for recordation in full compliance with the provisions of this title and the state Subdivision Map Act. 
B.  Conveyances of any part of a division of real property for which a final or parcel map is required by this title shall not be made by parcel or block number, initial or other designation, unless and until such map has been filed with the county recorder for recordation. 
C.  Subsections (A) and (B) of this section do not apply to any parcel or parcels of a subdivision offered for sale or lease, contracted for sale or lease, or sold or leased in compliance with or exempt from any law (including a local ordinance), regulating the design and improvement of subdivisions in effect at the time the subdivision was established. 
D.  Nothing contained in subsection (A) of this section shall be deemed to prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease or finance real property or to construct improvements thereon which such sale, lease or financing or the commencement of such construction is expressly conditioned upon the approval and filing of a final subdivision map or parcel map as required by the state Subdivision Map Act or this title. 
E.  For the purposes of this section, the limitation period for commencing an action, either civil or criminal, against the subdivider or an owner of record at the time of a violation of this title or of the State Subdivision Map Act, shall be tolled for any time period during which there is no constructive notice of the transaction constituting the violation, because the owner of record, at the time of the violation or at any time thereafter, failed to record a deed, lease, or financing document with the county recorder. 
(Ord. 810 § 63, 1994: Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)  
18.90.020 - Remedies. 
A.  Any deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title or state Subdivision Map Act, is voidable at the sole option of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, his heirs, personal representative or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy, within one year after the date of discovery of the violation, but the deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell is binding upon any successor in interest of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, other than those above enumerated, and upon the grantor, vendor or person contracting to sell, or his assignee, heir or devisee. 
B.  Any grantee, or his successor in interest, or real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title or the state Subdivision Map Act may, within one year of the date of discovery of such violation, bring an action in the superior court to recover any damages he has suffered by reason of such division of property. The action may be brought against the person who divided the property in violation and against any successors in interest who have actual or constructive knowledge of such division of property. 
C.  The provisions of this title shall not apply to the conveyance of any parcel of real property identified in a certificate of compliance filed pursuant to Section 66499.35 of the Government Code or identified in a recorded final map or parcel map, from and after the date of recording. 
D.  The provisions of this title shall not limit or affect in any way the rights of a grantee or his successor in interest under any other provisions of law. 
E.  This title does not bar any legal, equitable or summary remedy to which the city or other public agency, or any person, firm or corporation may otherwise be entitled, and the city or other public agency, or such person, firm or corporation may file a suit in the superior court of Ventura County to restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision for sale, lease or financing in violation of this title. 
F.  The city shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title or the state Subdivision Map Act if it finds that development of such real property is contrary to the public health or the public safety. The authority to deny such a permit or such approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner of the real property at the time of such violation or whether the applicant therefor is the current owner of the real property with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of his interest in such real property. 
G.  The city, in issuing a permit or granting approval for the development of any such real property, may impose those additional conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the current owner of record acquired the property, and which had been established at such time by this division or local ordinance enacted pursuant thereto, except that if a conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record under the provisions of this title, only such conditions stipulated shall be applicable. 
(Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)  
18.90.030 - Certificate of compliance. 
A.  Any person owning real property within the city may request the city engineer to determine whether such real property complies with the provisions of this title and the state Subdivision Map Act. 
B.  Upon making such determination, the city engineer, after conferring with the director of planning and community development, shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the county recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and shall state that the division of land complies with applicable provisions of this code and the state Subdivision Map Act. 
C.  1.  If the city engineer determines that such real property does not comply with the provisions of this code or the state Subdivision Map Act, he may, as a condition to granting a certificate of compliance, impose such conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant acquired his or her interest therein, and which had been established at such time by this title. Where, however, the applicant was the owner of record at the time of the initial violation of the provisions of this title who by a grant of the real property created a parcel or parcels in violation of this title; and such person is the current owner of record of one or more of the parcels which were created as a result of the grant in violation of the state Subdivision Map Act and this title thereto, then the city engineer may impose such conditions as would be applicable to a current division of the property. 
2.  Upon making such a determination and establishing such conditions, the city engineer or authorized representative shall cause a conditional certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the county recorder. Such certificate shall serve as notice to the property owner who has applied for the certificate pursuant to this section, a grantee of the property owner, or any subsequent transferee or assignee of the property that the fulfillment and implementation of such conditions shall be required prior to subsequent issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property. 
3.  Compliance with such conditions shall not be required until such time as a permit or other grant of approval for development of such property is issued. 
D.  A recorded final map, parcel map, official map, or an approved certificate of exception shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described therein. 
E.  For the purposes of administration of this section, any parcel that is shown on the county assessor's maps prior to January 1, 1980, shall be considered as a conforming parcel. 
F.  A fee to be charged at actual cost shall be charged to the applicant for making the determination and processing the certificate of compliance. A deposit may be required to be applied toward this fee. 
(Ord. 810 § 64, 1994; Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)  
18.90.040 - Certificate of noncompliance. 
A.  Whenever the city engineer has knowledge that real property has been divided in violation of the provisions of this title or the state Subdivision Map Act, he/she shall cause to be mailed by certified mail to the then current owner of record a notice of intention to record a notice of violation (certificate of noncompliance) with the county recorder. 
B.  The notice of intention shall describe the real property in detail, name the owners thereof, and describe the violation and explain why the subject parcel is not a lawful subdivision under Government Code Section 66412.6. The notice of intention shall state that an opportunity will be given to the owner to present evidence to the city engineer as to why such notice of violation should not be recorded. The notice shall specify the day, time and place of the hearing which shall take place no sooner than thirty days and no later than sixty days from the date of mailing the notice of intention. The notice of intention shall also provide that if an objection is not filed with the city engineer within fifteen days of receipt of the notice, the city shall record the notice of intention with the county recorder. 
C.  If, after the owner has presented evidence, the city engineer determines that there has been no violation, a release of the notice of intention shall be filed with the county recorder if needed, and a letter of clearance shall be mailed to the then current owner of record. If however, after the owner has presented evidence, the city engineer determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided, then the city engineer shall record the notice of violation with the county recorder. 
D.  The tentative or final notice, when recorded, shall be deemed to be constructive notice of the violation to all successors in interest in such property. 
(Ord. 810 § 65, 1994: Ord. 570 § 3 (part), 1984.)

Chapter 18.100 - HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
Sections: 
 
18.100.010 - Intent and purpose. 
The intent and purpose of this chapter is to implement the goals and policies of the general plan and the various elements contained therein as they relate to the development of the hills, mountains and natural land forms within the city and to ensure the maintenance of open space, the retention of scenic resources of the city, and addressing the general design, which includes cut-and-fill slopes, soil stabilization and drainage to further enhance the public health, safety and welfare by regulating development in hillside areas. 
(Ord. 682 § 2 (part), 1988.)  
18.100.020 - Applicability. 
A.  In addition to the foregoing provisions of Title 18 relating to subdivisions, this chapter shall also apply to any subdivision upon which there exists a developable open space of land which has any portion of the natural undeveloped land with slopes of fifteen percent or greater. This chapter shall not apply to administrative lot line adjustments. 
B.  The hillside development standards set forth in this chapter shall be considered as part of a parcel map or tentative tract map application in order to avoid the creation of undevelopable parcels of land. 
C.  Any subdivision of land proposed in areas falling wholly or partially under the provisions of these hillside development standards shall not be divided into such a fashion as to preclude the reasonable use of any resulting parcel(s). Developable land may not be divided from land substantially undevelopable under the provisions of these development standards unless: 
1.  The undevelopable parcels are to be held in common by the owner(s) of the resulting developable parcel(s); or 
2.  The undevelopable parcel(s) is conveyed to and accepted by an appropriate public agency or other party (e.g., homeowners' association) to be used for other than residential purposes, such as, but not limited to, parks, flood control facilities, campgrounds, agriculture, or other uses consistent with the open space element of the general plan; and 
3.  An open space easement over the undevelopable, parcel(s) specifying the allowable nonresidential or, alternatively, the prescribed uses, is dedicated to the city or other appropriate agency; 
4.  If a parcel of land is proposed for division into two or more parcels, each parcel shall have a proportionate share of the total developable land; 
5.  Any parcel created pursuant to the provisions of these development standards and entirely in fifteen percent or greater slope, or designated as open space in the general plan, shall be ten acres or greater in size. 
(Ord. 652 § 2 (part), 1988.)  
18.100.030 - Development standards. 
The following development standards will be used by the planning commission and/or the city council in evaluating and reviewing hillside development proposals and to determine consistency with the general plan and hillside development standards. Should these development standards conflict with any other provisions of the city's municipal code or other standards adopted by the city, the stricter of the standards shall prevail. 
A.  Grading Standards. Proposed grading shall respect the natural contour of the subject terrain wherever possible. In addition, the city's general plan and various elements contained therein that apply to hillside development, as well as other applicable grading requirements, shall be used. The following grading standards shall apply to all grading of land (if more than one thousand cubic yards): 
1.  Manufactured slopes should not exceed thirty feet in height. Slopes may exceed thirty feet in height if no feasible alternative exists; and 
2.  Where grading is necessary, the following principles of contour grading should be employed: 
a.  Manufactured slopes should be rounded and shaped to simulate the natural terrain, 
b.  Grading should follow the natural topographic contours as much as possible, 
c.  Manufactured slopes should blend with naturally occurring slopes at a radius compatible with the existing natural terrain, 
d.  Grading on naturally occurring slopes of fifteen percent grade or more which has a vertical height of more than thirty feet shall not occur unless such grading becomes necessary and is specifically approved by the planning commission and/or the city council after making the appropriate findings as part of the parcel map or tentative tract map review. A detailed plan for slope stabilization shall be submitted by the applicant, 
e.  No manufactured slope shall have a slope angle steeper than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1). Shallower slope angles may be required if detailed soils and geologic investigations indicate such, and 
f.  Manufactured slopes shall be landscaped to screen views under or behind buildings. 
B.  Drainage Standards. Natural habitats and vegetation shall be considered and preserved wherever possible. To this extent all proposed drainage facilities shall respect the natural (before development) hydrologic characteristics of the subject terrain; where feasible, drainage channels shall be preserved in the natural state; where preservation is not feasible, drainage channels shall be designed in such a manner as to simulate the natural environment and preserve the public health, safety and welfare. The provisions of the following standards shall apply to all land subject to these regulations, and shall be in addition to the provisions of the adopted version of the city master drainage plan, and any other applicable drainage requirements: 
1.  Alterations to the drainage courses may be allowed if the application of this section will result in upstream or downstream flooding hazards for which there is no other feasible means of mitigation consistent with the findings. In order to preserve natural habitat and vegetation, replanting may be required upon recommendation of the director of planning and community services in conjunction with the director of engineering services, or their designees. 
2.  In the event that off-site drainage facilities will be required to handle increased runoff from any development subject to these regulations, interim drainage facilities which provide for no increase in peak runoff from a calculated average fifty-year storm shall be constructed and maintained until such time as the permanent facilities are completed. 
3.  The overall drainage system, including interim erosion-control measures, shall be completed and made operational at the earliest possible time during construction, or shall otherwise be provided for in a manner acceptable to the city. If a development is to be phased, all downstream (including interim facilities within the project area, or required interim off-site drainage facilities) elements of the approved drainage facilities will be completed or otherwise provided for in a manner acceptable to the city before the completion of upstream phases. 
C.  Street Standards. The design of streets and the circulation pattern within any proposed project governed by these regulations shall be such as to minimize grading requirements; shall, to the maximum feasible extent, complement the natural contours of the land; shall serve to retain the natural features of the impacted hillsides; and shall be designed in such a manner as to reduce street mileage to a minimum. 
1.  Local Street Widths. In order to encourage a rural feeling, local street widths shall comply with city council Policies No. 8-1 and No. 8-3. 
2.  Driveway Grade Access. Where access to isolated land areas with less than twenty percent slope can be provided only by constructing a roadway traversing natural slopes in excess of twenty percent, such a roadway shall not traverse twenty percent slopes for more than a cumulative distance of one hundred feet. 
3.  Special Streets. Special streets, such as one-way streets, split-level streets and dead-end streets, may be acceptable when their use is justified by detailed engineering studies submitted by the applicant, approved by the city engineer and in consultation with the director of planning and community development, or their designees, and are found to be necessary for the full achievement of the findings of these development standards. The final design of these streets shall be approved by the planning commission and/or city council. 
4.  Applicability of City Road Standards. In all other respects, any proposed trafficways shall comply with the city road standards. Exceptions to the city road standards may be granted under these development standards if the city engineer, in consultation with the director of planning and community development or their designees, or the planning commission, or the city council, determines that the findings of these development standards serve to be furthered by such an exception and all possible plan alternatives that attempt to meet existing standards have been exhausted. 
D.  Design Standards. Applicants are encouraged to employ site planning and architectural techniques which implement the findings of these development standards. In general, any proposed residential land use must be planned and designed in such a fashion as to complement and preserve the hillside terrain as well as provide a safe living environment. 
1.  Buildings. 
a.  Those building styles and lot configurations which lend themselves to hillside development, or those which are easily adapted to meet the special design and terrain requirements presented by hillside areas are encouraged. The intent is to encourage building methods in ten to twenty percent slope areas which minimize terrain disruption and blend with the natural contours of the subject hillside terrain. 
b.  Buildings and grading should be planned in such a manner as to hide necessary grading under or behind buildings. An example of such a technique would be split-level construction. 
2.  Viewshed. 
a.  View from land subject to the provisions of these development standards should be respected through design. 
b.  Living areas of dwelling units should be faced onto open, green or view areas. 
c.  Proposed structures should be located in such a manner as to avoid as much as possible interference with the view from other existing or proposed dwelling units. 
E.  Ridgeline Development Standards. In order to implement the findings of these development standards, there shall be no development along ridgelines easily visible from the valley floor in order to preserve the existing backdrop to the community, and to maintain the open character of the visually prominent ridgelines surrounding Camarillo. The purpose of this section is to set forth standards for maintaining such ridgelines and their immediate adjacent slopes. 
1.  Areas to Remain Undeveloped. 
a.  Structures subject to the provisions of these development standards shall not be constructed on top of any visually prominent ridgeline, unless the planning commission and/or city council after considering evidence determines that there is no feasible alternative. 
b.  No point on any structure subject to the provisions of these development standards shall be closer to a visually prominent ridgeline than one hundred and fifty feet measured horizontally on a topographic map or fifty feet measured vertically on a cross-section, whichever is more restrictive, except that this requirement shall not affect the location of structures where the highest portion of the structure is below the visible elevation of a prominent ridgeline. 
2.  Definitions. 
a.  A "visually prominent ridgeline" means any hill location visible from the valley floor, measured from a distance of five hundred feet back from the toe of the slope which is a slope of five percent or less, as determined by the director of planning and community development or his designees. 
F.  Landscaping Standards. All hillside property subject to these development standards shall be landscaped and irrigated, where determined necessary, in such a manner to reduce fire hazard, stabilize cut/fill slopes, reduce erosion, retain moisture, and enhance the natural scenic beauty of the valley. 
1.  Retention of Vegetation. Wherever possible, well-adapted, drought-resistant natural flora shall be retained. 
2.  Major Tree Planting. The planting of major trees in areas to remain in natural open space should include, but not be limited to, the following native species: 
a.  Juglans California hindsi (California Black Walnut); 
b.  Plantanus racemosa (California Sycamore); 
c.  Quercus agrifolia (California Live Oak); 
d.  Quercus lobata (Valley Oak). 
3.  Landscaping in Application Area. Landscaping in application area should be integrated with other elements of the proposal and comply with other guidelines for the preservation of natural topographic features, the view of ridgelines from the valley floor and the preservation of vistas. 
(Ord. 652 § 2 (part), 1988.)  
18.100.040 - Required technical reports and materials. 
At the time of submittal for subdivision application, certain technical reports and materials shall also be submitted in addition to those required by Section 18.10.030. No application for a subdivision will be accepted as complete until all required reports and materials have been submitted. Such reports and materials will be used to determine the suitability of the subject site for development and to suggest special construction and design measures necessary to mitigate identified problems which may endanger the public health, safety and welfare. The report and materials shall include the following: 
A.  Site Plan and Elevations. The applicant shall submit, as part of the subdivision application, adequate samples of materials, elevations, drawings and site plans necessary to make a determination as to the extent to which the development standards are being met. The site plan shall show all property lines, existing and proposed building locations, driveways, open space areas, parking and landscaped areas. The site plan shall also show the topography of the lot, abutting streets, highways, topographic features located within one hundred fifty feet of all lot lines and any additional data which may be required by the commission to determine compliance with this chapter. The building elevations shall be dimensioned and show all walls, buildings and structures along with samples of the colors and materials. 
B.  Slope Analysis. The applicant shall submit as part of the subdivision application an analysis of the existing slope of the property. The slope analysis will be used to determine the appropriate slope of any land, and the square footage or acreage within any slope category. "Slope" means and is defined as the relationship between the change in elevation (rise) of land and the horizontal distance (run) over which that change in elevation occurs. The percentage of any given slope is determined by dividing the rise by the run on the natural slope of land, multiplied by one hundred. 
1.  Slope Map Requirements. For the purpose of determining the amount and location of land falling into each slope category, the applicant shall submit to the department of planning and community development at the time of application a base topographical map of the subject site prepared by a registered civil engineer licensed to survey or land surveyor. Such a map shall have a scale of not less than one inch to one hundred feet and a contour interval of not more than two feet, provided that the contour interval may be ten feet when the slope is more than twenty percent. This base topographical map shall include all adjoining properties within one hundred fifty feet of the site boundaries. Slope bands in the range of zero to ten percent, ten to fifteen to twenty percent, and twenty percent or greater shall be shown on the map. The base topographical map shall also include, or be accompanied by, a tabulation of the land area in each slope category, specified in acres. The exact method for computing the percent slope and area by percent slope category should be sufficiently described and presented so that a review can be readily made. 
2.  Slope Mapping Method. 
a.  The percent slope of any particular piece of land shall be plotted on the slope map by dividing the vertical rise between the contours employed by the horizontal distance between the same contours, multiplied by one hundred. The minimum contour interval employed shall be two feet and the maximum contour interval employed ten feet, with the ten-foot interval being preferred. 
b.  In preparing a slope map, isolated slope areas (i.e., surrounded by a flatter or steeper slope category) with a horizontal run of less than one hundred feet and a vertical rise of less than thirty feet shall be disregarded and the area thereof classified as being within the adjacent category. 
c.  In preparing a slope map, those portions of ravines, ridges and terraces of less than one hundred and fifty feet in width at their widest measurement which are in an area generally sloping at twenty percent slope or greater shall be regarded as being of twenty percent slope or greater, and shall be included as part of the bordering twenty percent slope or greater band. 
C.  Geotechnical Reports. The applicant shall submit, as part of the subdivision application, a geotechnical study in accordance with Chapter 16.38. 
D.  Drainage. The applicant shall submit, as part of the subdivision application, a drainage plan, including text, calculations, maps and diagrams. The director of engineering services in consultation with the director of planning and community development, or their designees, shall review these submissions for completeness, adequacy and conformance with the above and other applicable standards. 
1.  The report shall include, but not be limited to the hydrologic conditions on the site, possible on-site flood inundation, downstream flood hazards, identification of natural drainage courses, conclusions and recommendations regarding the effect of hydrologic conditions on the proposed development, opinions and recommendations covering the adequacy of the sites to be developed, and design criteria to mitigate any identified hydrologic hazards consistent with these regulations. 
2.  The investigation and report shall be completed by a registered civil engineer experienced in the science of hydrology and hydrologic investigation. 
3.  Recommendations included in the report and approved by the director of engineering services in consultation with the director of planning and community development, or their designees, shall be incorporated into the subject application and all associated plans and maps. 
E.  Grading. At the time of formal application, a preliminary grading plan shall be submitted detailing the extent and nature of proposed grading. Such a plan should include, but not be limited to: 
1.  Preliminary cross-sections detailing both the original and proposed ground surfaces, with grades, slopes and elevations needed; 
2.  A preliminary soil stabilization report including proposed final groundcover, landscaping and erosion control; 
3.  Erosion control measures to prevent soil loss when grading is in process; 
4.  Certification by the registered geologist who prepares the geotechnical study required by Section 18.100.040C that the proposed grading is consistent with the findings and recommendations of said report. 
F.  Landscape Plan. 
1.  A preliminary landscaping plan prepared by a registered landscape architect or contractor and acceptable to the director of planning and community development shall be submitted at the time of application. Such a plan shall outline all proposed planting in graded and nongraded areas, means of irrigation, proposed timing of landscape installation, and the manner in which landscaping will be maintained. A precise landscape plan shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a grading permit. 
2.  Plans and proposed programs for the ongoing maintenance of landscaped areas shall be submitted at the time of application. Such plans shall include, but not be limited to, responsible parties or agencies, the nature and extent of each agency's and party's responsibility, and the financial arrangements for maintenance. The director of planning and community development shall review these plans for completeness, adequacy and conformance with applicable standards. 
G.  Report Waiver. Any or all of the above required reports may be waived by the director of planning and community development in consultation with the city engineer, or their designees, under the following conditions: 
1.  The existence of recently completed and satisfactory reports covering the same subject matter on the same site;

That the degree of compatibility of property uses for which this section is intended to promote and preserve shall be maintained with respect to the particular use on the particular site and consideration of existing and potential uses of property within the zone and the general area in which the use is proposed to be located; 
b.  That performance standards and conditions shall be imposed upon uses which without such condition might become obnoxious, dangerous, offensive or injurious to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a portion thereof by reason of the emission of noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vibration, odor or other harmful or annoying substances;

B.  After revocation of a permit, the property affected thereby shall be subject to the regulations of the applicable zone classification.

19.38.020 - Fence and wall heights. 
A.  Wall and fences not exceeding six feet in height shall be permitted along all side and rear yard lot lines. All walls and fences in any front yard may not exceed three feet in height. In the corner cutback area of corner lots, the height of mature landscaping without pruning, walls, fences, or other obstructions may not exceed three feet in height unless visual clearance can be shown due to the open type of landscaping proposed and a determination is made by the director of public works as to the adequacy of visual clearance. 
B.  Notwithstanding the above provisions, existing walls and fences shall be permitted to remain unless the wall or fence creates a public nuisance or a public hazard. 
C.  Fences enclosing tennis courts located in the rear half of a lot may be over six feet in height and shall be wire mesh or other materials whose vertical surface is not more than forty percent solid. 
D.  A fence, wall or hedge may be located or maintained along the side or rear lot lines provided such fence, wall, or hedge does not exceed six feet in height and does not extend into the required front yard or a side yard along the street side of a reverse corner lot. If access is provided to the rear of a reverse corner lot, a fence or wall shall be limited to three feet in height. 
E.  When within five feet of the opposite sides of a fence or wall the ground level differs by more than two feet, the wall may be increased in height one foot for each two feet of difference in grade but in no case greater than eight feet. The wall design shall be approved by the department of public works. 
(Ord. 403 § 1 (part), 1978: prior code § 9502(A).)  
19.38.030 - Hazardous areas.

19.38.050 - Intersection visibility and corner cutbacksStreets and alleys. 
A.  Intersection Visibility at Uncontrolled Intersections. 
1.  At intersections where traffic is not required to stop on any approach, there shall be no visual obstruction within the corner cutoff area of any corner lot. The corner setback shall be defined by a line on a horizontal plane connecting two points along the front and side street property lines and forming a triangle. These points shall be measured fifty feet back from the intersection or the prolongation of the front and street side property lines. Properties that were approved or developed prior to April 26, 1995 shall be considered exempt and may continue to be subject to the comer setback of thirty feet as measured from the front and side lot line. 
2.  Projects which are located in a planned development area with private streets would be considered under a residential planned development permit subject to review and approval by the planning commission. However, intersecting streets from the private project to the public street shall comply with the corner cutback provision or include appropriate traffic control measures approved by the city. 
B.  Intersection Visibility at Controlled Intersections. At controlled intersections, the procedure for providing the "sight triangle" which is the area to be clear of obstruction for sight distance at controlled intersections shall be in accordance with Caltrans Design Manual (Figure 1, set out at the end of this section, illustrates the sight triangle). The manual specifies a driver eye height of 3.5 feet, an approaching vehicle height of 4.25 feet, a driver's eye setback of fourteen feet from the flowline (four-foot stop bar setback plus ten-foot eye setback from the stop bar) and the sight distances included in Table 1. Within the sight triangle, all objects shall be below three feet in height and above seven feet in height. In cases where providing intersection sight distance is unreasonable due to site characteristics as determined by the director of engineering services and the director of planning and community development, adjustment can be made as long as a safe stopping sight distance can be provided. Examples of unreasonably costly conditions include areas where a wall or building exists on an adjoining lot or in hillside areas where extreme grading would be necessary.

(Ord. No. 1054, § 3(Att. No. 1), 5-12-2010)  
19.44.020 - General provisions. 
A.  The off-street parking requirements of this chapter apply at the time of the construction, alteration, intensification, change in use or occupant load, or change in form of ownership of a building or use. As used in this chapter, "change in form of ownership" means conversion of all or a portion of a project to condominiums, community apartments, stock cooperatives or other similar forms of ownership. 
B.  Off-street parking must be maintained in connection with any existing building or use so long as the building or use remains unless an equivalent substitute number of such spaces are provided and thereafter maintained in conformance to the requirements of this chapter. 
C.  Where off-street parking space in connection with a building or use does not conform to the requirements of this chapter, then the building or structure may not be altered, extended, expanded, nor may its form of ownership be changed, unless the current parking requirements of this chapter are satisfied. Any such non-conforming use that is discontinued for one year may not reestablish unless the use complies with the provisions of this chapter. 
D.  A parking space is an area for the parking of a motor vehicle plus such additional areas as required to provide for safe ingress to and egress from the space. 
E.  The area set aside to meet the parking requirements of this chapter must be usable and must have permanent access. 
F.  Where multiple uses are provided, the required parking must satisfy the individual and cumulative needs of that complex and provide the minimum number of parking spaces necessary to serve the various uses except as otherwise provided for mixed-use developments. If the parking area is reserved or restricted to a particular use, such reservation or restriction must be strictly limited to a period of time and not to a particular use. Any such limitation requires the city's prior written approval and must remain in force as long as deemed necessary by the city to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
G.  Uses that include service vehicles must provide parking spaces above the minimum number of spaces required by this chapter. This is to ensure that adequate space for the employees and customers will be maintained on-site. 
H.  Required off-street parking spaces and parking areas may be used only for parking operable vehicles of residents, employers, employees, customers and visitors as appropriate to the allowed uses of the applicable zone. 
I.  All off-street parking spaces and aisles must be kept clear of any temporary or permanent obstructions. 
(Ord. No. 1054, § 3(Att. No. 1), 5-12-2010)  
19.44.025 - Computation of parking requirements. 
A.  The floor area calculation will be based on the gross floor area of the building or use except where otherwise provided. 
B.  Restrooms, utility rooms, equipment rooms, elevator shafts, duct space, and stair wells will be excluded from the square footage when computing floor area for parking purposes. 
C.  The floor area includes exterior walls but excludes exterior areas. 
D.  Interior hallways will be included as part of the floor area for determining the gross floor area. 
E.  Any fractional spaces over fifty percent will be construed as one full space. 
F.  In any place of public assembly utilizing benches, pews, or other non-individualized seating structure, each 18-inch section of such structure will be construed as one seat. 
G.  A building or portion of a building devoted to off-street parking will have no off-street parking requirements. 
H.  In the case of mixed uses in a building or on a lot, the total requirements for off-street parking facilities will be the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately. Off-street parking facilities for one use will not be considered as providing required parking facilities for any other use except as specified in this chapter for common facilities or joint uses.

C.  The planning commission or city council must grant the concession or incentive requested by the applicant, unless it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, that: 
1.  The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in Section 19.49.010(E); 
2.  The concession or incentive would have a specific, adverse impact upon public health and safety, or the physical environment, or on any real property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households; or 
3.  The concession or improvement would be contrary to state or federal law. 
(Ord. No. 1068, § 2, 9-28-2011; Ord. No. 1141, § 3(Exh. A), 4-26-2017)  
19.49.025 - Waiver or reduction of development standards. 
A.

19.49.030 - Calculation of density bonus. 
A.  The applicant may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density bonus. 
B.  The amount of density bonus to which the applicant is entitled will vary according to the amount by which the percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the percentage established in Section 19.49.010(C). 
C.  For housing developments meeting the criteria of Section 19.49.010(C)(1), the density bonus will be calculated as follows: 
Percentage Low Income Units 	Percentage Density Bonus 
10 	20 
11 	21.5

19.49.040 - Additional density bonus or concession or incentive through provision of child care facility. 
A.  When an applicant proposes to construct a housing development that conforms to the requirements of Section 19.49.010(C) and includes a child care facility that will be located on the premises of, as part of, or adjacent to, the project, the planning commission or city council must grant either of the following: 
1.  An additional density bonus that is an amount of square feet of residential space that is equal to or greater than the amount of square feet in the child care facility; or 
2.  An additional concession or incentive that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility. 
B.  The planning commission or city council will require, as a condition of approving the housing development, that the following occur: 
1.  The child care facility must remain in operation for a period of time that is as long as or longer than the period of time during which the density bonus units are required to remain affordable pursuant to Section 19.49.010(E). 
2.  Of the children who attend the child care facility, the children of very low income households, lower income households, or moderate income households must equal a percentage that is equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units that are required for very low income households, lower income households, or moderate income households pursuant to Section 19.49.010(C). 
C.  Notwithstanding any requirement of this section, the planning commission or city council is not required to provide a density bonus or concession for a child care facility if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities. 
D.  For the purpose of calculating a density bonus, the residential units do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels. The density bonus is permitted in geographic areas of the housing development other than the areas where the units for the lower income households are located. 
E.  The granting of a concession or incentive will not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
(Ord. No. 1068, § 2, 9-28-2011; Ord. No. 1141, § 3(Exh. A), 4-26-2017)  
19.49.045 - City's discretion in granting density bonus. 
Nothing in this chapter will be construed to prohibit the planning commission or city council from granting a density bonus greater than what is described in this chapter for a development that meets the requirements of this chapter, or from granting a proportionately lower density bonus than what is required by this chapter for developments that do not meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1068, § 2, 9-28-2011; Ord. No. 1141, § 3(Exh. A), 4-26-2017)

1.  Zero to one bedrooms: one onsite parking space. 
2.  Two to three bedrooms: two onsite parking spaces. 
3.  Four and more bedrooms: two and one-half parking spaces. 
B.  The applicant may apply for a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, that does not exceed .5 onsite parking spaces per bedroom, for a development meeting the criteria of Section 19.49.010(C), that is located within .5 miles of a major transit stop, and has unobstructed access to the major transit stop. 
C.  The applicant may apply for a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, that does not exceed .5 onsite parking spaces per unit for a development that consists solely of rental units (exclusive of a manager's unit) with an affordable housing cost to lower income households, and is either: 
1.  Located within .5 miles of a major transit stop, and has unobstructed access to the major transit stop; or 
2.  A for-rent housing development for individuals who are 62 years of age or older that complies with Sections 51.2 and 51.3 of the Civil Code, and has either paratransit service, or unobstructed access to a fixed bus route service that is within .5 miles and operates at least eight times per day. 
D.  The applicant may apply for a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, that does not exceed .3 onsite parking spaces per unit, for a development that consists solely of rental units (exclusive of a manager's unit) with an affordable housing cost to lower income households, and is a special needs housing development, and has either paratransit service, or unobstructed access to a fixed bus route service that is within .5 miles and operates at least eight times per day. 
E.  If the total number of parking spaces required for a development is other than a whole number, the number will be rounded up to the next whole number. For purposes of this section, a development may provide "onsite parking" through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not through on-street parking. 
F.  This section applies to a development that meets the requirements of Section 19.49.010(C), but only at the request of the applicant. An applicant may request additional parking incentives or concessions beyond those provided in this chapter, subject to Section 19.49.020. 
G.  Notwithstanding Sections 19.49.050(B) and (C), if the city or an independent consultant has conducted an area-wide or jurisdiction-wide parking study in the last seven years, then the city may impose a higher vehicular parking ratio, not to exceed the ratio described in Section 19.49.050(A), based upon substantial evidence found in the parking study that includes an analysis of parking availability, differing levels of transit access, walkability access to transit services, the potential for shared parking, the effect of parking requirements on the cost of market-rate and subsidized developments, and the lower rates of car ownership for low- and very low income individuals, including seniors and special needs individuals. The city will pay the costs of any new study. The city may make findings, based on a parking study completed in conformity with this section, supporting the need for the higher parking ratio.

Chapter 19.60 - SIMILAR USES PERMITTED BY COMMISSION DETERMINATION 
 
19.60.010 - Similar uses permitted by commission determination. 
A.  It is recognized that in the development of comprehensive zoning regulations: 
1.  Not all uses of land can be listed, nor can all future uses be anticipated; 
2.  A use may have been omitted from the list of those specified as permissible in each of the various zones in this title designated; or 
3.  Ambiguity may arise concerning the appropriate classification of a particular use within the meaning and intent of this title. 
Hence, the phrase, "other uses which the commission may determine to be similar to those listed above and not more obnoxious or detrimental to other uses permitted in the zone or to the public health, safety, and welfare," appears under "uses permitted" in each zone. 
(Ord. 403 § 1 (part), 1978: prior code § 9601(A).)  
19.60.020 - Procedure. 
A.  When an unlisted use is proposed for a particular zone or when classification of an unlisted use is requested, it shall be the duty of the commission to ascertain all pertinent facts concerning the use and by resolution of record set forth its findings and the reasons for designating a specific classification for such use. 
B.  Findings. In permitting or classifying an unlisted use, the commission shall first make a finding that all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  That the use is in keeping with the stated intent and purpose of the zone; 
2.  That field investigations have disclosed that the subject use and its operation are compatible with the uses permitted; 
3.  That the subject use is similar to one or more uses permitted in the zone within which it is proposed to be located; and 
4.  That the subject use will not cause substantial injury to the values of property in the zone within which it is proposed to be located.

2.  The demanding party, within ten calendar days after service of the list, shall either:

b.  Strike one name from the list and return the list to the city manager. 
3.  Upon expiration of such ten-day period, if the demanding party does not strike a name, the judicial arbitrator shall be the retired judge on the list with the lowest number next to his or her name. 
4.  If the demanding party strikes a name from the list the city manager of city may strike the name of any retired judge whose name remains on the list. The retired judge whose name remains on the list shall be designated as the judicial arbitrator. If the city manager does not strike a name from the list, the city manager shall resubmit the list to the demanding party and that party may strike one name from the list. If the demanding party strikes a name from the list, the remaining named retired judge shall serve as the judicial arbitrator. If the demanding party does not strike a name from the list, then the retired judge whose name appears on the list with the lowest number next to his or her name shall act in the capacity as judicial arbitrator. 
5.  If, for any reason, the designated retired judge is unwilling or unable to serve as the judicial arbitrator, the judge on the list with the next lower number whose name was not stricken shall be the judicial arbitrator.

7.  By way of illustration, if the list served by the city manager, upon the demanding party, has the names of three retired judges, A, B and C, numbered 1, 2 and 3, respectively; and numbers 1 and 2 are stricken, then C, number 3, shall be deemed, for all purposes, to be the designated judicial arbitrator. 
8.  The judicial arbitrator shall, in conducting the hearing, follow the rules of procedure applicable to a mandamus proceeding under Section 1085 or 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
9.  If the judicial arbitrator finds that the use proposed by the application would comply with the provisions of this chapter, he or she shall order city to approve the application.

Chapter 19.65 - HOME OCCUPATIONS 
 
19.65.010 - Purpose. 
Home occupations in residential zones are not a right but a privilege and are intended to provide, as a matter of convenience, certain types of business uses where the use is clearly ancillary to the residential use of the property. Under specific guidelines, these provisions establish a comprehensive set of regulations to determine if a business activity occurring in residential structures is appropriate. In order to minimize potential interference with the intended residential use of the property, businesses conducted as home occupations would be limited to certain types of uses with only those members of the residential family who reside at the residence being able to conduct or participate in the business. Home occupations will be reviewed on an individual basis to ensure compatibility with and avoid any impact on the residential quality of life and property values within the zone. Any use which has the significant potential to impact that quality of life or change the character of the area would not be permitted, and any use which does not conduct its operation within these guidelines would be subject to revocation. 
(Ord. 713 § 5 (part), 1990.)

The use may not violate the city's sign code (Chapter 17.04) by displaying at any location on the premises, contrary to the sign code, any advertisement that a business is being conducted at the residence. No home occupation permit will be issued if any state or other licensing permit requires any signage as prohibited by the sign code; 
18.  In a cluster residential project with five units per acre or greater which have been developed on the property, the use may not involve or create the need for more than the parking which has been assigned to the individual unit or occupy more parking spaces than that assigned to that unit;

Chapter 19.68 - MODIFICATIONS[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1104, § 3(Exh. A), adopted Feb. 25, 2015, amended Ch. 19.68 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 19.68, §§ 19.68.010, 19.68.020, pertained to administrative minor modifications, and derived from prior Code § 9606(A), (B); Ord. No. 403, § 1, adopted 1978. 
 
19.68.010 - Purpose. 
When in the public interest, the director or the planning commission may consider and approve modifications of previously approved permits as specified in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1104, § 3(Exh. A), 2-25-2015)  
19.68.020 - Application and modification classifications. 
A request for a modification of an approved development permit or conditional use permit pursuant to this chapter may be filed by any property owner or agent acting on behalf of property owner. The request will be reviewed by the director and classified into one of the following categories: 
A.  Administrative Permit Adjustment. Any change which would not alter any of the findings pursuant to this title, nor any findings contained in the environmental documentation prepared for the permit, and would not have any adverse impact on surrounding properties, may be deemed an administrative permit adjustment subject to the issuance of a zoning clearance, with any conditions imposed by the director in the director's sole discretion, without a hearing. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  A maximum increase or decrease of ten percent or five thousand square feet, whichever is less, in the floor area of a previously approved structure; 
2.  A maximum decrease of ten percent of the area of an approved landscaping plan. Reductions greater than ten percent may be approved as an administrative permit adjustment if the reduction is the result of an approval in an increase of floor area of a previously approved structure as provided in Section 19.68.020(A)(1); 
3.  The conversion of landscaping to artificial turf and drought tolerant themes in accordance with Section 19.38.060; 
4.  Minor exterior architectural changes or embellishments involving no change in basic architectural style; 
5.  The addition of ancillary mechanical equipment when it can be shown that noise from the equipment will not create a nuisance to the adjoining property. 
6.  Minor changes to an approved planned development or conditional use plan, including the addition of ancillary structures, not affecting the placement of the primary structure on the site or the number of parking spaces required. 
B.  Administrative Minor Modification. Any change which would not conflict with any of the required findings pursuant to this title, nor any analysis or mitigation measures contained in the original environmental documentation prepared for the permit and would not have any adverse impact on surrounding properties, but is determined by the director to rise to a level of increased or decreased use or intensity such that the requested modification cannot qualify for an administrative permit adjustment, may be deemed an administrative minor modification subject to the issuance or a minor modification permit, with any conditions imposed by the director in the director's sole discretion, without a hearing. Administrative minor modifications are limited to the following: 
1.  Yards. Reduction of yards and distance between buildings by not more than twenty percent of the requirement of the zone. 
2.  Parking Spaces. Reduction of number of required parking spaces by not more than ten percent, and modification of other parking design standards, as provided in Sections 19.44.130 through 19.44.280. 
3.  Slope and Hillside Areas. For areas with a grade of eight percent or more, modification of building height to a maximum of thirty feet and modification of front yard to a minimum of ten feet, upon approval of a site plan, elevations, and a grading map showing existing and finished contours. Approval must be based on the finding that such minor modification will not have a detrimental effect upon adjacent properties. 
4.  Modification of a landscaping plan approved under a planned development permit or conditional use permit for other than a reduction in landscape area as allowed under Section 18.68.020(A)(2) 
5.  Gates and Entrances. Height of entrance walls and gates may be modified to extend above that allowed in front and side-front setback areas when approved by the architectural advisory committee of the planning commission. The modification must be based on the findings that the limited height extension is architecturally acceptable and creates no interference with sight clearance or corner cutoff; and, in addition, no detrimental effects will be created by the modification to adjacent properties in the same vicinity and zone. Elevations, colors and materials are to be submitted as part of the application for an administrative minor modification. 
6.  Trash Enclosures. When hardship is created by the provisions of the trash enclosure regulations, minor modifications may be applied to reduce the requirements of Chapter 19.50. 
C.  Major Modifications. All requested modifications not classified by the director as administrative permit adjustments or administrative minor modifications are major modifications and must be approved by the body that originally approved the permit, subject to the same notice, hearing, review criteria and appeal procedures required by this title for consideration of the original permit. 
(Ord. No. 1104, § 3(Exh. A), 2-25-2015)  
19.68.030 - Applicable procedures. 
The following procedures apply to requests for modifications: 
A.  Once the director classifies a modification request, the requestor must either complete a zoning clearance form for the approval of an administrative permit adjustment, or a modification application for the approval of an administrative minor modification, or a major modification, and pay the appropriate fee, as established by city council resolution. 
B.  The director may refer any request for a modification of architectural design to the architectural review committee of the planning commission for review and determination of approval or denial of the modification request. 
C.  The director may refer any request for modification to the planning commission to advise the director as to the proper classification level of approval for the request; or, the director may refer the application to the planning commission for review and determination of approval or denial. 
D.  In approving a minor modification, the director must determine that the adjustments are necessary to make reasonable use of the land and that adequate protection has been provided to protect the public peace, health, safety and welfare and may include conditions of approval. The director will make a decision in writing within fourteen days after the acceptance of a complete application, unless the director has referred the decision to the architectural review committee of the planning commission or to the planning commission. One copy will be mailed to the applicant and one copy will be filed with the secretary of the planning commission. 
1.  If the director has referred the decision to either the architectural review committee of the planning commission or to the planning commission, the request for modification will generally be placed on the next available agenda of the respective body. 
2.  If the applicant is dissatisfied with a decision of the director, the applicant may appeal the decision to the planning commission, where the determination will be final. The applicant must pay the appropriate fee for the appeal of the director's decision to the planning commission as established by city council resolution. 
E.  If the applicant is dissatisfied with a decision of the architectural review committee of the planning commission, the applicant may appeal the decision to the planning commission, where the determination will be final. The applicant must pay the fee for the appeal of the architectural review committee's decision at the same fee rate as that of an appeal of a director's decision to the planning commission, as established by city council resolution. 
F.  Any person may appeal, and the city council may issue an order of review of, a decision of the planning commission for the approval, conditions of approval, or denial of a modification request. Such appeal and council order of review must be made in accordance with the city council appeal and order of review provisions of the zone in which the subject property is located, and must be filed with the director within ten days of the date the commission's decision is made.

(Ord. 609 § 1 (part), 1986.)

The board will consider annually all applications for development allotments properly submitted and must make recommendations to the city council based on the criteria set forth below: 
A.  Availability of Public Facilities and Services. The board will examine each application for its relation to or impact upon local public facilities and services, and will rate each development by the assignment of from 0 to ten points (with 0 indicating very poor and ten indicating excellent) on each of the following attributes: 
1.  The capacity of the water infrastructure to provide for the needs of the proposed development without system extensions beyond those normally installed by the developer and the impact the project will have on water supply. 
2.  The capacity of the sanitary sewers to dispose of the waste of the proposed development without system extensions beyond those normally installed by the developer. 
3.  The capacity of the drainage facilities to adequately dispose of and treat surface runoff from the proposed development without system extensions beyond those normally installed by the developer. 
4.  The ability of the fire department to provide fire protection according to the established response standards of the city without the necessity of establishing a new station or requiring the addition of major equipment or housing facilities to an existing station. 
5.  The capacity of the applicable public schools to absorb the children expected to inhabit a proposed development without necessitating or adding to double sessions or other unusual scheduling or classroom overcrowding. 
6.  The capacity of surface streets to provide for the needs of the proposed development without substantially altering existing traffic patterns or overloading the existing street system, impact to Highway 101, and provision of complete streets. 
7.  The availability of parks, playgrounds, and other recreational facilities. 
8.  Developments which have received tentative map or other city entitlements for a project will receive five points for the first year of approval, eight points for the second year after approval, and ten points for the third year after approval. 
B.  Quality of Design and Contribution of Public Welfare and Amenity. The board will examine each application which has not been withdrawn by the applicant for failure to meet the requirements of subsection (A), and will rate each development by the assignment of from 0 to ten points (with 0 indicating very poor and ten indicating excellent) on each of the following attributes: 
1.  Architectural design quality of buildings, which may be assessed in terms of consistency with the General Plan Community Design Element in its attention to detail in terms of size, height, scale, massing, building materials, architectural details, and color; and compatibility with existing neighboring development. 
2.  The amount and character of open space and slope landscaping. 
3.  Site plan design quality, which may be assessed in terms of consistency with the General Plan Community Design Element, incorporation of natural features such as topography and open space, compliance with site development standards, the arrangement of the site for efficiency of circulation, on and off site traffic safety, and privacy. 
4.  The provision of public and/or private usable open space. 
5.  Contributions to and extensions of existing multi-use trails and facilities and/or greenbelts. 
6.  The provision of needed public facilities such as a connecting link in the Circulation Element of an arterial or collector street, stormwater drainage and treatment facilities, parks, or other vital public facilities.

8.  Impact on trees and cultural resources. 
9.  The provisions of water conservation features. 
10.  The provision of energy generation and conservation features, such as house siting and design and renewable energy generation features. 
11.  Impacts on the physical and aesthetic environment, including agriculture and other open spaces. 
12.  Projects which contain affordable housing units in accordance with the criteria under Section 20.01.010(E) will be entitled to up to 15 additional bonus points. If the project does not include affordable housing units, this criteria will not be subtracted or figured into the total percentage points. 
C.  The board will meet to assign evaluation points for each development allotment application. After assigning evaluation points, the board will prepare two lists, one documenting points awarded from subsection (A) and the other from subsection (B) of this section, arranging the developments in each list in order from greatest to lowest number of points. In addition to listing the number of actual points awarded in each subcategory, the total will then be expressed as a percentage of the maximum number of points awardable. 
D.  Following its preliminary evaluation as provided in subsection (C), the rating given to each development will be published and a public hearing will be scheduled on the preliminary point assignments made by the board. 
1.  Any applicant may request the board, at the public hearing, to reevaluate the point assignment made on any of the criterion. In order for the board to alter its point assignment on a particular development, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists pertinent information or a project redesign which the board was not aware of at the time of the original evaluation. 
2.  Any applicant who is dissatisfied with the board's reevaluation may submit written notification of such dissatisfaction, which will be furnished to the city council prior to its awarding of development allotments. 
E.  After evaluating each development and clarifying all point assignments to the applicants, the board will present its evaluations, along with the decisions reached on any requests for reevaluations, to the city council for the awarding of development allotments.
