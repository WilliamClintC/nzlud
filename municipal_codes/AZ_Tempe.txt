ARTICLE III. - NUISANCE PARTIES AND UNLAWFUL GATHERINGS 
 
Sec. 5-30. - Purpose. 
(a)  The City finds and determines that the control of nuisance parties on private property is necessary when such continued activity is determined to be a threat to the peace, health, safety or general welfare of the public. Often police response is required at a nuisance party in response to complaints in order to disperse uncooperative participants or enforce criminal laws. The response of police officers to a location constitutes a drain of personnel and resources which may leave other areas of the City without minimal levels of police protection, all of which creates a significant hazard to the safety of the police officers and to the public in general. 
(b)  The City finds and determines it is a public nuisance for any responsible person(s) or social hosts to permit, allow, or host an unlawful gathering at his or her place of residence (or other private real property under his or her ownership or control) where spirituous liquor is served to, or is in the possession of, or consumed by, any minor, or where illegal drugs are in the possession of, or consumed by, any person. When unlawful gatherings occur, the City finds and determines that early intervention through substance use education for the responsible person is desirable.

If such a person is a juvenile, the term "responsible person" includes, in addition to the juvenile, the juvenile's parents or guardians. Responsible person does not include owners or persons in charge of premises where an unlawful gathering or nuisance party takes place if the persons in attendance obtained use of the property through illegal entry or trespassing. 
Special security assignment means the police services provided during any call in response to complaints or other information regarding nuisance party or unlawful gatherings. 
Spirituous liquor shall have the same meaning as defined in A.R.S. § 4-101(31).

(1)  The owner was present at or had knowledge of the nuisance party or unlawful gathering and took no reasonable action to prevent the nuisance party or unlawful gathering; or 
(2)  If the owner had been sent a notice from the City that a nuisance party or unlawful gathering had taken place on the premises, and a subsequent nuisance party or unlawful gathering with the same responsible person, persons, sponsors or hosts occurs within ninety (90) days of the mailing of such notice to the owner; or

(Ord. No. O2018.59 , § 1, 8-30-18)  
Sec. 8-117. - Building address, tenant suite and dwelling unit number assignment. 
117.1 Scope. The provisions of this section shall serve as the requirements for the assignment of addresses, building identification letters, tenant suite and dwelling unit numbers for buildings within the City of Tempe. 
117.2 Intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a consistent method of assigning building identification to aid fire fighters and other emergency responders, provide for efficient access to property records and information, ensure conformance to the standards of the U. S. Postal Service, and our utility companies. 
117.3 General address assignments. The Community Development Department is responsible for the assignment of addresses and building identification letters. New developments will be initially processed under the address and or parcel number assigned for each undeveloped parcel. The Building Safety Division will subsequently assign the final address or addresses while the project plans are under review and before building permits are issued with each building being suited at the time of permit review of a shell building. 
In addition, the Building Safety Division is responsible for the assignment of the individual tenant suite and dwelling unit numbers. 
Once assigned, all building addresses, building identification letters, tenant suite and dwelling unit numbers shall be forwarded by the Community Development Department to the Maricopa County Assessor's Office, U.S. Postal Service, Tempe Police Department and Fire Medical Rescue Departments, and all utility companies. 
The actual size, color, and field placement of addresses, tenant suite and dwelling unit numbers shall be as specified in the Tempe Zoning and Development code. 
117.4 Tenant suite and dwelling unit numbers processing procedure. To initiate this process the project must submit a separate site plan including the building layouts to the Building Safety Division for tenant suite and dwelling unit number assignment. This submittal shall consist of a properly scaled site plan depicting the site, building layouts, parking lots, building orientations, driveway locations, building exits, elevators, lobbies, and corridors. Proposed tenant layout plans may also be submitted with the required site plan to assist in the proper assignment of suite numbers. 
Paper copy submittals shall consist of two (2) copies of plan sheets, at least 24" x 36" in size, providing the same information as noted above. 
All tenant suite and dwelling unit numbers shall be assigned prior to permit issuance for any tenant improvements. 
117.5 Tenant suite and dwelling unit number assignments. All tenant suite and dwelling unit spaces within multi-occupant, multi-family and multi-family mixed use buildings shall be assigned individual tenant suite and dwelling unit numbers. Separate street addresses shall not be assigned to multiple tenants in a single building. 
Exception: Existing buildings with tenant suite or individual address numbers that were approved prior to this current address policy except as noted in Section 117.7 of this code. 
117.5.1 Tenant space layout. Retail and office buildings will be assigned a separate suite number for each 20-foot increment of space along the length of the building. Buildings that have tenant entrances on 2 or more sides will be assigned suite numbers on the entry sides of the building for each 20 foot increment of space. Reference lines will be drawn on the plan in to represent the 20 foot spacing. The reference lines shall determine the suite number a tenant improvement may use based on its proposed location within the building. 
Exceptions: 
1.  Mixed use buildings such as office/warehouse and similar mixed uses may be divided into increments of up to 40 feet. 
2.  Apartments, condominiums, and hotels/motels will be assigned a unit number for each dwelling or sleeping unit. 
3.  Townhouses without the availability of individual addresses will be assigned a unit number for each unit. 
The suite numbers assigned to these spaces represent the possible number of spaces that the building may be divided into and are not meant to represent the actual tenant space layouts. 
If a proposed tenant improvement encompasses multiple spaces, the tenant may choose any suite number within the range of suite numbers that the space will occupy. 
When a proposed tenant improvement that encompasses multiple spaces splits a space, the higher suite/unit number within the range may not be used by the tenant. 
117.5.2 Numbering. Suite/unit numbers are assigned as three (3) digit numbers. The first digit in the suite number will represent the floor level of the suite/unit. Unit number are assigned as four (4) digit numbers for townhomes (without individual addresses), apartments and residential condominiums of nine (9) stories or less. 
Exception: Four-digit suite/unit numbers will be used for multi-occupant floors above the 9 th floor, including multifamily residential condominiums and apartments. Duplicate unit numbers will not be used within multifamily projects, even if the project has more than one address or street entry. Projects containing multiple street addresses (areas) and containing a letter designation for each building will have unit numbers assigned sequentially throughout the project. When numbering sequentially from one area to another, each new area will commence its numbering with the next 100 series left off from the previous area. 
117.5.3 Exterior tenant entrances. For buildings with exterior tenant entrances, the suite numbering shall follow the addressing guidelines based on the orientation of the building and its location in relation to Mill Avenue and the Salt River. 
117.5.4 Interior tenant entrances. For buildings with suites only accessed through interior entrances, the suite numbering starts with 101 on the left side of the main entrance of access and continues clockwise around the corridor. 
For multiple floors, the suite numbering begins with the first suite on the left after exiting the elevator or main entry stairway for buildings with no elevator, and continuing clockwise around the corridor. 
When buildings have multiple floors, the first suite shall start with '01 numbers, such as 201, and 301, applicable to each floor level and shall start in the same general location as required for the first suite (101) on the ground floor then continue clockwise sequentially around the corridor. 
Exception: Single tenant spaces that occupy a complete floor level may be assigned the '00 number, such as 200 and 300, applicable to that floor level, provided that when the floor is occupied by two or more tenant spaces the numbers shall be reassigned to '01 numbering. 
117.5.5 Basements. Basement suite/unit numbers shall be preceded with the letter B. 
117.6 Non-conforming structures appeal process. Buildings and projects that cannot readily conform to these standards shall be reviewed on a case by case basis by a multi-disciplinary team made up an authorized member of the Police Department, Fire Medical Rescue Department, Community Development Department, and the U.S. Postal Service. Decisions rendered by this team may only be appealed through a formal application for a Code Modification and with input of the Community Development Department Director or their designee. 
117.7 Existing buildings. Buildings not in conformity with the current address policy may continue to utilize existing suite numbering until such time that the building is: 
1.  At or below a 50% vacancy rate; and 
2.  When a tenant improvement is proposed. 
Buildings not in conformity and with a proposed new tenant improvement after the building is at or below 50% vacancy rate shall be required to use the newly assigned suite numbers. The existing occupied suites will have twelve (12) months, from date of assignment, to conform to the newly assigned suite numbers. If a conflict in suite numbering exists because of re-suiting to the current policy, the building official or designee shall implement a suite numbering plan for the building which shall, as practicable, bring all suites into substantial compliance.

The City may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the license under paragraph (3)(a)(i) or on events considered under paragraph (3)(a)(ii) unless the City has provided the cable operator licensee with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the City has waived its right to object, or has effectively acquiesced. 
(5)  Any cable operator licensee whose proposal for renewal has been denied by a final decision of the City made pursuant to this section, or has been adversely affected by a failure of the City to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section, may appeal such final decision or failure pursuant to the provisions of Sections 626 and 635 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 546 and 555.

Secs. 10-16—10-19. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE III. - LICENSE REQUIREMENTS 
 
Sec. 10-20. - Incorporation of application by reference. 
(a)  Upon award of a license pursuant to this chapter, a licensee shall agree to be bound by all the applicable terms and conditions contained herein. 
(b)  Failure to abide by the applicable terms and conditions of license will be deemed a breach of the license and this chapter to which the provisions of Sections 10-73 through 10-75 and 10-87 shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 91.33, 10-17-91; Ord. No. 2007.39, 6-28-07; Ord. No. O2014.74, 12-4-14)  
Sec. 10-21. - Fees, costs and payments. 
(a)  For the reason that the streets and other public rights-of-way which are used by the licensee in the operation of its video services system within the boundaries of the City are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the City at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to the licensee to the use of said streets is a valuable property right without which the licensee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and because the City will incur costs in regulating and administering the license, the licensee shall pay to the City an amount no less than five percent (5%) of licensee's gross revenues ("the license fee"). Should federal or state regulations be amended in the future to allow the City to receive a greater fee than the fee set forth in subsection (a), then, in that event, the City shall have the right to increase the fee as provided by law. 
(b)  If a licensee offers subscribers a price discount if they obtain a bundle of voice, video and data services, then beginning on the effective date of this license for the purpose of computing gross revenues, the discount shall be allocated either (1) consistent with the prices published in licensee's marketing materials for separate video service or rate for separate video service or one (1) or more non-video services or (2) in proportion to the value of those video services and non-video services for which individual prices are not published. It is the intent of this subsection that a licensee not bundle video services with non-video services in such a manner that the amount of gross revenues attributed to the video services will reduce the license fees payable under the license. Allocation under (2) above shall be in accordance with the following examples: 
(1)  The amount of any discount on a bundle of services shall be determined from the sum of the lowest stand-alone rates available to a subscriber or class of subscribers for each of the goods and services which are offered at the combined rate, as follows: assume a subscriber's charges for a given month for video services alone would be eighty dollars ($80.00), for local telephone service alone sixty dollars ($60.00), and for internet service alone sixty dollars ($60.00), for a total of two hundred ($200.00). If a licensee offers the three (3) services at a combined rate of one hundred sixty dollars ($160.00) (i.e. the subscriber in effect receives a twenty percent (20%) discount from the regular retail rates that would apply to the services if purchased individually), for license fee computation, gross revenues from video services would be deemed to be forty eight dollars ($48.00) (sixty dollars ($60.00 less twenty percent (20%)). 
(2)  Assume the same facts as in the preceding example, except that the subscriber also purchases optional packages or premium video channels at a fixed fee of thirty dollars ($30.00) a month that is not included in the bundled service offering the discount (i.e. the discount does not apply to this service) for a total of one hundred ninety ($190.00) (one hundred sixty dollars ($160.00) bundle offer, plus thirty dollars ($30.00)). Gross revenues would be seventy eight dollars ($78.00) (forty eight dollars ($48.00) from the prior example of bundled services plus the undiscounted thirty dollars ($30.00)). 
(3)  Nothing herein shall be construed to require a licensee to offer any service at a price, where the price for that service is otherwise established by law or regulation. 
(c)  Licensee shall also be responsible for reasonable costs that are associated with damage to the right-of-way or city infrastructure within the right-of-way caused by the construction, maintenance and operation of its network or facilities and pay any fines, fees, charges or damages for breach of the terms and conditions of the license as outlined in the license agreement. Such costs shall not be subject to any offset of license fees owed. 
(d)  The payment of the license fee by the licensee to the City shall be made quarterly by delivery of the same to the Chief Financial Officer of the City on or before the 20th day of the following month. At the time license fees are due, licensee will provide to the City an itemized report that includes the following information: 
(1)  A current revenue statement showing the gross revenues by the licensee during the preceding quarter; 
(2)  The amount of gross license fees due to the City; 
(3)  A detailed report of all costs incurred by licensee by permit number (when applicable) of any fees imposed by the City and paid by the licensee for which the licensee is claiming state law allows to be offset to the license fees owed; and 
(4)  The amount of license fees owed and being paid to the City after accounting for any offset. 
(e)  If such payment is not made by the next to the last business day of the following month, the City may impose interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month commencing from the date payment should have been made and continuing until the payment is made. Fractions of a month shall be considered to constitute a full month for the purpose of computing interest. In addition to interest which may be assessed under this subsection, if licensee fails to pay any license fee, before the end of such grace period, licensee shall be subject to the following civil penalties: 
(1)  A licensee who fails to pay the license fee or any portion thereof within the time prescribed shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid fee each month, unless the licensee shows that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; 
(2)  A licensee who fails or refuses to pay a license fee or any portion thereof after notice and demand by the City shall pay a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the unpaid fee, unless licensee shows that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; or 
(3)  If the cause of failure to pay the license fee or any portion thereof is determined by the City to be due to civil fraud or evasion of the license fee, the licensee shall pay a penalty of fifty percent (50%) of the amount of deficiency. 
(f)  The City shall have the right to inspect the licensee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter; provided, however, that such audit shall take place within thirty-six (36) months following the close of each of the licensee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due to the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the licensee by the City and said notice shall include a copy of the audit report.

Sec. 10-22. - Use of telephone facilities. 
When and in the event that the licensee of any license granted hereunder uses a telephone company's video services system distribution channels furnished to the licensee pursuant to tariff or contract on file with a regulatory body having jurisdiction and said licensee makes no use of the streets independent of such telephone company furnished facilities, said licensee remains fully bound by the terms of its license and this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 91.33, 10-17-91; Ord. No. O2014.74, 12-4-14)  
Sec. 10-23. - Required services and facilities. 
(a)  A license shall include a description of proposed video services system design and a description of the initial programming and video services to be offered, a description of facilities proposed for local programming, and facilities to be offered to various community institutions. 
(b)  A licensee shall maintain the mix, level and quality of programming within the broad categories of video programming or other services set forth in its license. Where there has been a substantial failure to maintain the mix, level or quality of services within the broad categories of video programming or other services as set forth in the licensee's license, the Engineering and Transportation Director or designee may direct the licensee to comply with its obligations in this regard. To the extent not prohibited by federal or state law, a licensee will provide a public benefit to the community as agreed upon by the licensee and the City and as set forth in the license. Such public benefit will not modify or otherwise affect licensee's obligation to pay license fees to the City under Section 10-21 and any additional commitments under this section are not to be offset or otherwise credited in any way against any license fee payment under the license. 
(Ord. No. 91.33, 10-17-91; Ord. No. O2014.74, 12-4-14; Ord. No. O2019.03 , 2-28-19)  
Sec. 10-24. - Subscriber service rates. 
(a)  Authority to regulate rates. If and when permitted by federal and state law, regulation by the City of the rates for a cable television system's basic service will be set forth in the license. 
(b)  Information on rates and charges. Licensee shall provide information to the City and subscribers of the applicable rates and charges for video services. Prior to implementing a change in rates, programming services or channel positions, licensee shall provide electronic or written notice to the City and subscribers within the amount of time set forth in the license. 
(Ord. No. 91.33, 10-17-91; Ord. No. O2014.74, 12-4-14)  
Sec. 10-25. - Public, educational and government access channels. 
(a)  City shall not directly or indirectly control the content of any of the programming on a video services system except those channels dedicated to government access.

--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 87.25, adopted Sept. 10, 1987, Ch. 12, Art. II, floodplain management, in its entirety to read as herein set out. The substantive provisions of former Art. II, §§ 12-16-12-22, were derived from Code 1967, §§ 15-1-15-7; and Ord. No. 828.3, §§ I-VI, adopted Sept. 27, 1984. 
 
Sec. 12-16. - Purpose. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(c)  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges, located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize blight areas caused by flooding; 
(7)  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; 
(8)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; and 
(9)  To maintain eligibility for disaster relief. 
(Ord. No. 87.25, 9-10-87; Ord. No. 2013.52, 10-3-13)  
Sec. 12-17. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
(a)  In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(b)  This article takes precedence over any less restrictive, conflicting local laws, ordinances and codes. 
(Ord. No. 87.25, 9-10-87; Ord. No. 2013.52, 10-3-13)

(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(Ord. No. 87.25, 9-10-87)  
Sec. 12-23. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee thereof, the State of Arizona, or FEMA for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 87.25, 9-10-87; Ord. No. 2013.52, 10-3-13)

(Ord. No. 87.25, 9-10-87)  
Sec. 12-35. - Variances and the right of appeal. 
(a)  The Floodplain Administrator may grant variances from the requirements of this article. 
(1)  A variance shall be granted only for a parcel with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or surrounding property owners. 
(2)  Those physical characteristics must be unique to that property and not shared by adjacent parcels and pertain to the land, not to any structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. 
(b)  The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  In passing upon such applications, consideration shall be given all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the City; 
(5)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(6)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(7)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(d)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing Sections 12-28 and 12-29 and items (c)(1) through (10) above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(e)  Upon consideration of the factors of items (c)(1) through (10) above and the purposes of this article, the Floodplain Administrator may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as he deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(f)  The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report any variances to the FEMA upon request. 
(g)  Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(j)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(k)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a city official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct the structure below the regulatory flood elevation will result in an increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notice will also state that the land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided for by A.R.S. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Board in the office of the Maricopa County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

(1)  Remittance of all tax charged and/or collected. When an added charge is made to cover city (or combined) privilege and use taxes, the person upon whom the tax is imposed shall pay the full amount of the city taxes due, whether collected by him or not, and in the event he collects more than the amount due he shall remit the excess to the Tax Collector. In the event the Tax Collector cannot ascertain from the records kept by the taxpayer the total or amounts of taxes collected by him, and the Tax Collector is satisfied that the taxpayer has collected taxes in an amount in excess of the tax assessed under this chapter, the Tax Collector may determine the amount collected and collect the tax so determined in the manner provided in this chapter.

Sec. 16-360. - Recordkeeping requirements. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of every person subject to the tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve suitable records and such other books and accounts as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax for which he is liable under this chapter. The books and records must contain, at a minimum, such detail and summary information as may be required by this article; or when records are maintained within an electronic data processing (EDP) system, the requirements established by the Arizona Department of Revenue for privilege tax filings will be accepted. It shall be the duty of every person to keep and preserve such books and records for a period equal to the applicable limitation period for assessment of tax, and all such books and records shall be open for inspection by the Tax Collector during any business day. 
(b)  The Tax Collector may direct, by letter, a specific taxpayer to keep specific other books, records, and documents. Such letter directive shall apply: 
(1)  Only for future reporting periods, and 
(2)  Only by express determination of the Tax Collector that such specific recordkeeping is necessary due to the inability of the taxing jurisdiction to conduct an adequate examination of the past activities of the taxpayer, which inability resulted from inaccurate or inadequate books, records, or documentation maintained by the taxpayer. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87; Ord. No. O2014.73, 12-4-14)  
Sec. 16-362. - Recordkeeping—Income.

(B)  The name, business address, and business activity of the customer, and 
(C)  Evidence sufficient to persuade a reasonably prudent businessman that the transaction is believed to be in good faith a purchase for resale, or a purchase, rental, lease, or license for use of rental equipment, by the vendee in the ordinary and regular course of his business activity, as provided by regulation. 
(2)  If the transaction is claimed to be exempt for any other reason: 
(A)  The name, business address, and business activity of the customer, and 
(B)  Evidence which would establish the applicability of the exemption to a reasonably prudent businessman acting in good faith. Ordinary business documentation which would reasonably indicate the applicability of an exemption shall be sufficient to relieve the person on whom the tax would otherwise be imposed from liability therein, if he acts in good faith as provided by regulation. 
(e)  With respect to those allowed deductions or exclusions for tax collected or charges for delivery or other direct customer services, where applicable, evidence that the deductible income has been separately stated and shown on the records of the taxpayer and on invoices or receipts provided to the customer. All other deductions, exemptions, and exclusions shall be separately shown and substantiated. 
(f)  With respect to special classes and activities, such other books, records, and documentation as the Tax Collector, by regulation, shall deem necessary for specific classes of taxpayer by reason of the specialized business activity of any such class. 
(g)  In all cases, the books and records of the taxpayer shall indicate both individual transaction amounts and totals for each reporting period for each category of taxable, exempt, and excluded income defined by this chapter.

(d)  The gross price of each acquisition claimed as exempt from tax, and with respect to each transaction so claimed, sufficient evidence to satisfy the Tax Collector that the exemption claimed is applicable. 
(e)  As applicable to each taxpayer, documentation sufficient to the Tax Collector, so that he may ascertain: 
(1)  All construction expenditures and all privilege and use taxes claimed paid, relating to owner-builders and speculative builders.

(Ord. No. O2014.73, 12-4-14)  
Sec. 16-366. - Recordkeeping—Out-of-city and out-of-state sales. 
(a)  Out-of-city sales. Any person engaging or continuing in a business who claims out-of-city sales shall maintain and keep accounting records or books indicating separately the gross income from the sales of tangible personal property from such out-of-city branches or locations. 
(b)  Out-of-state sales. Persons engaged in a business claiming out-of-state sales shall maintain accounting records or books indicating for each out-of-state sale the following documentation: 
(1)  Documentation of location of the buyer at the time of order placement; and 
(2)  Shipping, delivery, or freight documents showing where the buyer took delivery; and 
(3)  Documentation of intended location of use or storage of the tangible personal property sold to such buyer. 
(Ord. No. O2014.73, 12-4-14)  
Sec. 16-370. - Recordkeeping—Claim of exclusion, exemption, deduction, or credit; documentation; liability. 
(a)  All deductions, exclusions, exemptions, and credits provided in this chapter are conditional upon adequate proof and documentation of such as may be required either by this chapter or regulation. 
(b)  Any person who claims and receives an exemption, deduction, exclusion, or credit to which he is not entitled under this chapter, shall be subject to, liable for, and pay the tax on the transaction as if the vendor subject to the tax had passed the burden of the payment of the tax to the person wrongfully claiming the exemption. A person who wrongfully claimed such exemption shall be treated as if he is delinquent in the payment of the tax and shall be subject to interest and penalties upon such delinquency. However, if the tax is collected from the vendor on such transaction it shall not again be collected from the person claiming the exemption, or if collected from the person claiming the exemption it shall not also be collected from the vendor. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87; Ord. No. O2014.73, 12-4-14)  
Sec. 16-372. - Proof of exemption—Sale for resale; sale, rental, lease, or license of rental equipment. 
A claim of purchase for resale or of purchase, rental, lease, or license for rent, lease, or license is valid only if the evidence is sufficient to persuade a reasonably prudent businessman that the particular item is being acquired for resale or for rental, lease, or license in the ordinary course of business. The fact that the acquiring person possesses a privilege license number, and makes a verbal claim of "sale for resale or lease" or "lease for re-lease" does not meet this burden and is insufficient to justify an exemption. The "reasonable evidence" must be evidence which exists objectively, and not merely in the mind of the vendor, that the property being acquired is normally sold, rented, leased, or licensed by the acquiring person in the ordinary course of business. Failure to obtain such reasonable evidence at the time of the transaction will be a basis for disallowance of any claimed deduction on returns filed for such transactions. 
(Ord. No. O2014.73, 12-4-14)  
Sec. 16-380. - Inadequate or unsuitable records. 
In the event the records provided by the taxpayer are considered by the Tax Collector to be inadequate or unsuitable to determine the amount of the tax for which such taxpayer is liable under the provisions of this chapter, it is the responsibility of the taxpayer either: 
(a)  To provide such other records required by this chapter or regulation; or 
(b)  To correct or to reconstruct his records, to the satisfaction of the Tax Collector.

All exemptions, deductions, and credits set forth in this chapter shall be limited to the specific activity or transaction described and not extended to include any other activity or transaction subject to the tax.

(Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96)  
Sec. 16-516. - Taxpayer assistance orders. 
(a)  The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer, with or without a formal written request from a taxpayer, may issue a taxpayer assistance order that suspends or stays an action or proposed action by the Tax Collector if, in the Problem Resolution Officer's determination, a taxpayer is suffering or will suffer a significant hardship due to the manner in which the Tax Collector is administering the tax laws. 
(b)  A taxpayer assistance order may require the Tax Collector to release any lien perfected under this chapter, or cease any action or refrain from taking any action to enforce against the taxpayer any section of this chapter pending resolution of the issue giving rise to the taxpayer assistance order. 
(c)  The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer, City Manager or, for a city without a City Manager, the Chief Administrative Officer may modify, reverse or rescind a taxpayer assistance order. A taxpayer assistance order is binding on the Tax Collector until it is reversed or rescinded. 
(d)  The running of the applicable statute of limitations for any action that is the subject of a taxpayer assistance order is suspended from the date the taxpayer applies for the order or the date the order is issued, whichever is earlier, until the order's expiration date, modification date or recision date, if any. Interest that would otherwise accrue on an outstanding tax obligation is not affected by the issuance of a taxpayer assistance order. 
(e)  A taxpayer assistance order may not be used: 
(1)  To contest the merits of a tax liability. 
(2)  To substitute for informal protest procedures or administrative or judicial proceedings to review a deficiency assessment, collection action or denial of a refund claim. 
(Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96)  
Sec. 16-517. - Basis for evaluating employee performance. 
(a)  The Tax Collector shall solicit evaluations from taxpayers and include such evaluations in the performance appraisals of his employees, where applicable. 
(b)  The Tax Collector shall not evaluate an employee on the basis of taxes assessed or collected by that employee. 
(Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96)  
Sec. 16-520. - Reporting and payment of tax. 
(a)  Returns. The returns required under this chapter shall be made upon forms prescribed or approved by the Tax Collector, and shall be considered filed only when the accuracy of the return has been attested to, by signature upon the form, by an authorized agent of the taxpayer, and when such form has been received by the Tax Collector. 
(b)  Payment. If payment is made in any form other than United States legal tender, the tax obligation shall not be satisfied until the payment has been honored in funds. 
(c)  Requirement of security. If a taxpayer has remitted payment in the form of a check or other form of draw upon a bank or third party and such remittance has not been honored in funds, the Tax Collector may demand security for future pay rents. 
(d)  Method of reporting. Each taxpayer shall elect to report on either a cash receipts basis or an accrual basis and shall indicate the choice on the privilege license application. A taxpayer shall not change his reporting method without receiving prior written approval by the Tax Collector. 
(1)  Taxpayers must report all gross income subject to the tax using the same basis of reporting. 
(2)  Taxes imposed upon construction contracting shall be reported as follows: 
(A)  Construction contractors shall report on either a progressive billing ("accrual") basis or cash receipts basis. 
(B)  Speculative builders shall report the gross income derived from sale of improved real property at close of escrow or at transfer of title or possession, whichever occurs earlier. 
(C)  Owner-builders who are not speculative builders shall report taxable amounts as provided in Section 16-417. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87)  
Sec. 16-530. - When tax due; when delinquent; verification of return; extensions. 
(a)  Except as provided elsewhere in this section, the taxes shall be due and payable monthly on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the month next succeeding the month in which the tax accrues. 
(1)  Quarterly returns. The Tax Collector may authorize a taxpayer whose reporting history indicates an estimated annual City Privilege and Use Tax liability on taxable gross income in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) but less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) to file returns on a calendar-quarterly basis. The taxes for each calendar quarter shall be due and payable on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the month next succeeding the end of each calendar quarter. 
(2)  Annual returns. The Tax Collector may authorize a taxpayer whose reporting history indicates an estimated annual City Privilege and Use Tax liability on taxable gross income of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) to file returns for such taxes on a calendar-annual basis. The taxes for each calendar year shall be due and payable on or before the twentieth (20th) day of January of the following year. 
(b)  Special requirements of taxpayers filing quarterly or annual returns. No taxpayer may report a quarterly or annual basis until he has established, to the Tax Collectors satisfaction, six (6) months reporting history. It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the Tax Collector and increase his reporting frequency (to quarterly or monthly as applicable) when his taxable income or tax due exceeds the maximum limits for his current reporting frequency. Failure to do so may be deemed negligence or evasion, and penalties apply. Failure to file returns timely, without good cause shown to the satisfaction of the Tax Collector, is sufficient cause for the Tax Collector to deny future filings by the taxpayer on a quarterly or annual basis. 
(c)  Delinquency date. Except as provided in subsection (d) below, all returns and remittances received within the Tax Collector's Office on or before the last business day of the month when due shall be regarded as timely filed. The start of business of the first business day following the month when due shall be the delinquency date. It shall be the taxpayer's responsibility to cause his return and remittance to be timely received. Mailing the return or remittance on or before the due date or delinquency date does not relieve the taxpayer of the responsibility of causing his return or remittance to be received by the last business day of the month when due. 
(d)  Jeopardy reporting. If the Tax Collector determines that the collection of any tax due to the City is in jeopardy, the Tax Collector may direct the taxpayer to file his return and remit the tax on a weekly, daily, or transaction-by-transaction basis. Such return and remittance shall be due upon the date fixed by the Tax Collector, and the "delinquency date" shall be the following day. 
(e)  Extensions. The Tax Collector may extend the time for filing a return, for good cause shown, and only when requested in writing and received by the Tax Collector prior to the tax due date. However, the time for filing such return shall not be extended beyond the last business day of the month next succeeding the due date of such return. In such cases, only the penalties for late filing and late payment may be waived by the Tax Collector for filing and payment within the extension period. Notwithstanding the granting of an extension, the interest payable for late payment of taxes shall be paid for the period commencing upon the original delinquency date and ending on the date the tax is paid. The interest may not be waived by the Tax Collector. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87; Ord. No. 90.25, 7-12-90; Ord. No. 95.03, 1-12-95)  
Sec. 16-540. - Interest and civil penalties. 
(a)  Any taxpayer who failed to pay any of the taxes imposed by this chapter which were due or found to be due before the delinquency date shall be subject to and shall pay interest upon such tax until paid. From and after October 1, 2005, the interest rate shall be determined in the same manner and at the same times as prescribed by Section 6621 of the United States Internal Revenue Code and compounded annually under the method described in subsection (1) below. The rate of interest for both overpayments and underpayments for all taxpayers is the federal short-term rate, determined pursuant to Section 6621(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, plus three (3) percentage points. The interest rate prior to October 1, 2005 shall be one percent (1%) per month. Said interest may be neither waived by the Tax Collector nor abated by the hearing officer except as it might relate to a tax abated as provided by Section 16-570. 
(1)  On January 1 of each year any interest outstanding as of that date that was accrued from and after October 1, 2005 is thereafter considered a part of the principal amount of the tax and accrues interest pursuant to this section. 
(2)  Interest accrued prior to October 1, 2005 shall not be added to the principal. 
(b)  In addition to interest assessed under subsection (a) above, any taxpayer who failed to pay any of the taxes imposed by this chapter which were due or found to be due before the delinquency date shall be subject to and shall pay any or all of the following civil penalties, in addition to any other penalties prescribed by this chapter: 
(1)  A taxpayer who fails to timely file a return for a tax imposed by this chapter shall pay a penalty of five percent (5%) of the tax for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the delinquency date of the return and the date on which it is filed, unless the taxpayer shows that the failure to timely file is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. This penalty shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. 
(2)  A taxpayer who fails to pay the tax within the time prescribed shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid tax, unless the taxpayer shows that the failure to timely pay is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. If the taxpayer is also subject to a penalty under subsection (b)(1) above for the same tax period, the total penalties under subsection (b)(1) and this subsection shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. 
(3)  A taxpayer who fails or refuses to file a return within thirty (30) days of having received a written notice and demand from the Tax Collector shall pay a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax, unless the taxpayer shows that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or the Tax Collector agrees to a longer time period. 
(4)  If the cause of a tax deficiency is determined by the Tax Collector to be due to negligence, but without regard for intent to defraud, the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of deficiency. If the taxpayer is also subject to a penalty under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) above for the same tax period, the total penalties imposed under subsection (b)(1), (b)(2) and this subsection shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. 
(5)  If the cause of a tax deficiency is determined by the Tax Collector to be due to civil fraud or evasion of the tax, the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of fifty percent (50%) of the amount of deficiency. 
(c)  Penalties and interest imposed by this section are due and payable upon notice by the Tax Collector. 
(d)  If, following an audit, penalties attributable to the audit period are to be assessed pursuant to subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) above, the Tax Collector, before assessing such penalties, must take into consideration any information or explanations provided by the taxpayer as to why the return was not timely filed and/or the tax was not timely paid. If such information and/or explanations are provided by the taxpayer, and the Tax Collector nevertheless decides to assess penalties pursuant to subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) above, then, at the time the penalties are assessed, the Tax Collector must provide the taxpayer with a detailed written explanation of the basis for the Tax Collector's determination that the information and/or explanations provided by the taxpayer did not constitute reasonable cause. 
(e)  The assessment of the penalties prescribed by subsections (b)(3) through (b)(5) above must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the Tax Collector prior to such assessment. In addition, any assessment which includes penalties based upon subsection (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) above must be accompanied by a statement signed by the Tax Collector setting forth in detail the basis for the Tax Collector's determination that the penalties are warranted under the circumstances. 
(f)  The Tax Collector shall waive or adjust penalties imposed by subsections (b)(l) and (b)(2) above upon a finding that: 
(1)  In the past, the taxpayer has consistently filed and paid the taxes imposed by this chapter in a timely manner; or 
(2)  The amount of the penalty is greatly disproportionate to the amount of the tax; or 
(3)  The failure of a taxpayer to file a return and/or pay any tax by the delinquency date was caused by any of the following circumstances which must occur prior to the delinquency date of the return or payment in question: 
(A)  The return was timely filed but was inadvertently forwarded to another taxing jurisdiction. 
(B)  Erroneous or insufficient information was furnished the taxpayer by the Tax Collector or his employee or agent. 
(C)  Death or serious illness of the taxpayer, member of his immediate family, or the preparer of the reports immediately prior to the due date. 
(D)  Unavoidable absence of the taxpayer immediately prior to the due date. 
(E)  Destruction, by fire or other casualty, of the taxpayer's place of business or records. 
(F)  Prior to the due date, the taxpayer made application for proper forms which could not be furnished in sufficient time to permit a timely filing. 
(G)  The taxpayer was in the process of pursuing an active protest of the tax in question in another taxing jurisdiction at the time the tax and/or return was due. 
(H)  The taxpayer establishes through competent evidence that the taxpayer contacted a tax advisor who is competent on the specific tax matter and, after furnishing necessary and relevant information, the taxpayer was incorrectly advised that no tax was owed and/or the filing of a return was not required. 
(I)  The taxpayer has never been audited by a city for the tax or on the issue in question and relied, in good faith, on a state exemption or interpretation. 
(J)  The taxpayer can provide some public record (court case, report in a periodical, professional journal or publication, etc.) stating that the transaction is not subject to tax. 
(K)  The Arizona Department of Revenue, based upon the same facts and circumstances, abated penalties for the same filing period. 
A taxpayer may also request a waiver or adjustment of penalty for a reason thought to be equally substantive to those reasons itemized above. All requests for waiver or adjustment of penalty must be in writing and shall contain all pertinent facts and other reliable and substantive evidence to support the request. In all cases, the burden of proof is upon the taxpayer. 
(g)  No request for waiver of penalty under subsection (f) above may be granted unless written request for waiver is received by the Tax Collector within forty-five (45) days following the imposition of penalty. Any taxpayer aggrieved by the refusal to grant a waiver under subsection (f) above may appeal under the provisions of section 16-570 provided that a petition of appeal or request for an extension is submitted to the Tax Collector within forty-five (45) days of the taxpayer's receipt of notice by the City that waiver has been denied. 
(h)  For the purpose of this section, "reasonable cause" shall mean that the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence, i.e., had a reasonable basis for believing that the tax did not apply to the business activity or the storage or use of the taxpayer's tangible personal property in this City. 
(i)  For the purpose of this section, "negligence" shall be characterized chiefly by inadvertence, thoughtlessness, inattention, or the like, rather than an "honest mistake". Examples of negligence include: 
(1)  The taxpayer's failure to maintain records in accordance with article III of this chapter; 
(2)  Repeated failures to timely file returns; or 
(3)  Gross ignorance of the law. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87; Ord. No. 88.32, § 1(14), 4-28-88; Ord. No. 90.16, 3-29-90; Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96; Ord. No. 2007.20, 4-19-07)  
Sec. 16-541. - Erroneous advice or misleading statements by the tax collector; abatement of penalties and interest; definition. 
(a)  Notwithstanding Section 16-540(a), no interest or penalty may be assessed on an amount assessed as a deficiency if either: 
(1)  The deficiency assessed is directly attributable to erroneous written advice furnished to the taxpayer by an employee of the City acting in an official capacity in response to a specific request from the taxpayer and not from the taxpayer's failure to provide adequate or accurate information. 
(2)  All of the following are true: 
(A)  A tax return form prepared by the Tax Collector contains a statement that, if followed by a taxpayer, would cause the taxpayer to misapply this chapter. 
(B)  The taxpayer reasonably relies on the statement. 
(C)  The taxpayer's underpayment directly results from this reliance. 
(b)  Each employee of the Tax Collector, at the time any oral advice is given to any person, shall inform the person that the Tax Collector is not bound by such oral advice. 
(c)  For purposes of this section "tax return form" includes the instructions that the Tax Collector prepares for use with the tax return form. 
(Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96)  
Sec. 16-542. - Prospective application of new law or interpretation or application of law. 
(a)  Unless expressly authorized by law, the Tax Collector shall not apply any newly enacted legislation retroactively or in a manner that will penalize a taxpayer for complying with prior law. 
(b)  If the Tax Collector adopts a new interpretation or application of any provision of this chapter or determines that any provision applies to a new or additional category or type of business and the change in interpretation or application is not due to a change in the law: 
(1)  The change in interpretation or application applies prospectively only unless it is favorable to taxpayers. 
(2)  The Tax Collector shall not assess any tax, penalty or interest retroactively based on the change in interpretation or application. 
(c)  For purposes of subsection (b), "new interpretation or application" includes policies and procedures which differ from established interpretations of this chapter. 
(d)  Reserved. 
(Ord. No. 2007.20, 4-19-07)  
Sec. 16-545. - Deficiencies; when inaccurate return is filed; when no return is filed; estimates. 
(a)  If the taxpayer has failed to file a return, or if the Tax Collector is not satisfied with the return and payment of the amount of tax required, and additional taxes are determined by the Tax Collector to be due, the Tax Collector shall deliver written notice of his determination of a deficiency to the taxpayer, and such deficiency, plus penalties and interest, shall be due and payable forty-five (45) days after receipt of the notice and demand. Such additional taxes shall bear any applicable civil penalties and interest as provided in Section 16-540, and every such notice of a determination of an additional amount due shall be assessed within the limitation period provided in Section 16-550. 
(1)  When a return is filed. If the Tax Collector is not satisfied with a return and payment of the amount of tax required by this chapter to be paid to the City, he may examine the return or examine the records of the taxpayer, and redetermine the amount of tax, penalties, and interest required to be paid, for any periods available to the Tax Collector under Section 16-550, based upon the information contained in the return or records or based upon any information within his possession or which comes into his possession. 
(2)  When no return is filed. If any person fails to make a return, the Tax Collector may make an estimate of the amount of tax due under this CHAPTER and compute any applicable penalties and interest due, based upon any information within his possession or which comes into his possession. 
(b)  Estimates by the Tax Collector. Any estimate made by the Tax Collector is to be made on a reasonable basis. The existence of another reasonable basis of estimation does not, in any way, invalidate the Tax Collector's estimate. It is the responsibility of the taxpayer to prove that the Tax Collector's estimate is not reasonable and correct, by providing sufficient documentation of the type and form required by this chapter or satisfactory to the Tax Collector. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87)  
Sec. 16-546. - Closing agreements in cases of extensive taxpayer misunderstanding or misapplication; City Attorney approval; rules. 
(a)  If the Tax Collector determines that noncompliance with tax obligations results from extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of provisions of this chapter it may enter into closing agreements with those taxpayers under the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  Extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws occurs if the Tax Collector determines that more than sixty percent (60%) of the persons in the affected class have failed to properly account for their taxes owing to the same misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws. 
(2)  The Tax Collector shall publicly declare the nature of the possible misapplication and the proposed definition of the class of affected taxpayers and shall conduct a public hearing to hear testimony regarding the extent of the misapplication and the definition of the affected class. 
(3)  If, after the public hearing, the Tax Collector determines that a class of affected taxpayers has failed to comply with their tax obligations because of extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws it shall issue a tax ruling announcing that finding and publish the ruling in a newspaper of general circulation in the City and through the next two (2) Model City Tax Code Tempe updates. 
(4)  A closing agreement under this section may abate some or all of the penalties, interest and tax that taxpayers have failed to remit, or the agreement may provide for the prospective treatment of the matter as to the class of affected taxpayers. All taxpayers in the class shall be offered the opportunity to enter into a similar agreement for the same tax periods. 
(5)  Taxpayers in the affected class who have properly accounted for their tax obligations for these tax periods shall be offered the opportunity to enter into an equivalent closing agreement providing for a pro rata credit or refund of their taxes previously paid. 
(6)  The closing agreement shall require the taxpayers to properly account for and pay such taxes in the future. If a taxpayer fails to adhere to such a requirement, the closing agreement is voidable by the Tax Collector and he may assess the taxpayer for the delinquent taxes. The Tax Collector may issue such a proposed assessment within six (6) months after the date that he declares that closing agreement void or within the period prescribed by Section 16-550 of this chapter. 
(b)  Before entering into closing agreements pursuant to this section, the Tax Collector shall secure such approval as required by charter, ordinance or administrative regulation. 
(c)  After a closing agreement has been signed pursuant to this section, it is final and conclusive except on a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of a material fact. The case shall not be reopened as to the matters agreed upon or the agreement shall not be modified by any officer, employee or agent of the City. The agreement or any determination, assessment, collection, payment abatement, refund or credit made pursuant to the agreement shall not be annulled, modified, set aside or disregarded in any suit, action or proceeding. 
(d)  The Tax Collector shall report in writing its activities under this section to the Mayor and City Council on or before February 1 of each year. 
(Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96)  
Sec. 16-550. - Limitation periods. 
(a)  Limitation when a return has been filed. 
(1)  Except as provided elsewhere in this section, the Tax Collector may assess additional tax due at any time within four (4) years after the date on which the return is required to be filed, or within four (4) years after the date on which the return is filed, whichever period expires later. 
(2)  However, if a taxpayer does not report an amount properly reportable which is in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of the taxable amount stated on the return, the Tax Collector may assess additional tax due at any time within six (6) years after the date on which the return was filed. 
(3)  Any delay in commencement or completion of any examination by the Tax Collector, which is requested or agreed to in writing by the taxpayer, shall be excluded from the computation of any limitation period prescribed by this section, and the Tax Collector shall be entitled to make a determination for taxes due without exclusion of any such time period, and any limitation period shall be extended for a length of time equivalent to the period of the agreed upon delay. 
(4)  Any assessment of additional tax due by the Tax Collector shall be deemed to have been made by mailing a copy of a notice of audit assessment by certified mail to the taxpayer's address of record with the Tax Collector or by personal delivery of a copy of a notice of audit assessment to the taxpayer or his authorized agent. 
(b)  Suspension of limitation period. The limitation period on assessment shall be suspended for any period: 
(1)  The assets of the taxpayer are in the control or custody of the court in any proceeding before any court of jurisdiction within the United States of America, and for one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days thereafter; or 
(2)  Which the taxpayer and the Tax Collector agree upon in writing. 
(c)  When no return filed; fraudulent return. In the case of a fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax, or the failure or refusal to file a return for any month, the Tax Collector may assess the amount of taxes payable for that month at any time, without any reliance by the taxpayer upon any time limitation provided elsewhere in this chapter. 
(d)  Special provisions relating to owner-builders. The limitation for an owner-builder subject to the tax as prescribed in Section 16-417 shall be based upon the date such tax liability is reportable or was reported, as provided in Section 16-417. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87; Ord. No. 90.25, 7-12-90; Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96)  
Sec. 16-553. - Examination of taxpayer records; joint audits. 
(a)  Waiver of joint audit. A taxpayer that does not authorize a joint audit to be conducted for a tax jurisdiction is subject to audit by that tax jurisdiction at any time subject to the limitation provisions provided in Section 16-550. 
(b)  Tax jurisdiction acceptance of joint audit. If the Arizona Department of Revenue intends to conduct an audit of a taxpayer, the cities or towns for whom a joint audit is being conducted may accept the audit by the Arizona Department of Revenue or may elect to have a representative participate, provided that no more than two (2) city or town representatives in total may participate. 
(1)  If a city or town does not accept the audit as a joint audit, the city or town may not conduct an audit of the taxpayer for forty-two (42) months from the close of the last tax period covered by the audit unless an exception applies to that taxpayer pursuant to A.R.S. § 42-2059. 
(2)  If a joint audit is performed by a city or town, the Arizona Department of Revenue is not prohibited from conducting an audit that does not violate the provisions of A.R.S. § 42-2059. 
(Ord. No. 2001.16, 7-26-01)  
Sec. 16-555. - Tax collector may examine books and other records; failure to provide records. 
(a)  The Tax Collector may require the taxpayer to provide and may examine any books, records, or other documents of any person who, in the opinion of the Tax Collector, might be liable for any tax under this chapter, for any periods available to him under Section 16-550. 
(b)  In order to perform any examination authorized by this chapter, the Tax Collector may issue an administrative request for the attendance of witnesses or for the production of documents, as provided by regulation. 
(c)  If within sixty (60) days of receiving a written request for information in the possession of the taxpayer, the taxpayer fails or refuses to furnish the requested information, the Tax Collector may, in addition to penalties prescribed under Section 16-540, impose an additional penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of any tax deficiency which is attributable to the information which the taxpayer failed to provide, unless the taxpayer shows that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. 
(d)  The Tax Collector may use any generally accepted auditing procedures, including sampling techniques, to determine the correct tax liability of any taxpayer. The Tax Collector shall ensure that the procedures used are in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. 
(e)  The fact that the taxpayer has not maintained or provided such books and records which the Tax Collector considers necessary to determine the tax liability of any person does not preclude the Tax Collector from making any assessment. In such cases, the Tax Collector is authorized to use estimates, projections, or samplings, to determine the correct tax. The provisions of Section 16-545(b), concerning estimates, shall apply. 
(f)  The Tax Collector shall give the taxpayer written notice of his determination of a deficiency by certified mail to the taxpayer's address of record with the Tax Collector, and the tax deficiency, plus interest and penalties, is final forty-five (45) days from the date of receipt of the notice by the taxpayer, unless an appeal is taken pursuant to the provisions of Sections 16-570 through 16-575. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87; Ord. No. 95.03, 1-12-95; Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96)  
Sec. 16-556. - No additional audits or proposed assessments; exceptions. 
(a)  Once the Tax Collector completes an examination authorized by Section 16-555 and a written notice of the determination of a deficiency has been issued to the taxpayer pursuant to Section 16-545(a) or Section 16-555(f), the taxpayer's liability for the time period subjected to the examination is fixed and determined, and no additional audit or examination may be conducted by the Tax Collector with respect to such time period except under the following circumstances: 
(1)  If a taxpayer files a claim for refund under Section 16-560, the Tax Collector may conduct an examination limited to the issues presented in the refund claim. 
(2)  If the taxpayer failed to disclose material information during the initial examination, falsified books or records, or otherwise engaged in conduct which prevented the Tax Collector from conducting an accurate examination. The applicability of this subsection, and the Tax Collector's right to proceed thereunder, may be raised and contested by the taxpayer in a subsequent administrative review brought pursuant to Section 16-570. 
(b)  An audit or examination conducted by any other taxing jurisdiction will not preclude the Tax Collector from conducting an audit or examination for the same time period. 
(c)  If the Tax Collector issues a notice of deficiency pursuant to either Section 16-545(a) or Section 16-555(f), the Tax Collector may not increase the proposed deficiency except in one (1) or more of the following circumstances: 
(1)  The taxpayer made a material misrepresentation of fact. 
(2)  The taxpayer failed to disclose a material fact. 
(3)  The Tax Collector submitted a written request for information prior to issuance of the assessment, and the taxpayer, despite possessing or having access to such information, failed to provide it within sixty (60) days as required by Section 16-555(c). 
(4)  After issuing the notice of determination of deficiency but before the deficiency became final, the Arizona Tax Court, Court of Appeals or Supreme Court issued a decision, the applicability of which causes the deficiency initially proposed to increase. 
(Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96; Ord. No. 98.37, 06-25-98)  
Sec. 16-560. - Erroneous payment of tax; credits and refunds; limitations. 
(a)  The Tax Collector may authorize either credits or payments of refunds for any taxes, penalties or interest paid in excess of the amount actually due. Any credit authorized by the Tax Collector shall be canceled from the accounts of the City if no timely filed request for credit or refund is made by the claimant claiming same within one (1) year following the date of determination and notice by the Tax Collector of the excess payment. For purposes of this section, "claimant" means a taxpayer that has paid a tax imposed under this article and has submitted a credit or refund claim under this section. Except where the taxpayer has granted a customer a power of attorney to pursue a credit or refund claim on the taxpayer's behalf, claimant does not include any customer of such taxpayer, whether or not the claimant collected the tax from customers by separately stated itemization. 
(b)  No credit shall be allowed or refund paid except under one (1) of the following conditions: 
(1)  As provided in Section 16-565. 
(2)  Upon examination of filed returns for any period not excluded by Section 16-550, and not to exceed the tax, penalty, or interest actually paid with such returns. 
(3)  Upon audit or other examination of the books and records of the taxpayer, but only for periods as provided in Section 16-550. In the case of an examination performed at the taxpayer's request, credit shall be allowed or refund paid only for any excess taxes, penalties, or interest actually paid within the limitation period provided in Section 16-550, such period to be calculated from the date of receipt of the taxpayer's request by the Tax Collector. Requests by taxpayers for audits to authorize credits shall be honored unless, in the opinion of the Tax Collector, the taxpayer has made excessive requests for audits. 
(4)  Upon the claimant's submission of a written claim for credit or refund of any taxes, penalties, or interest paid to the City by the claimant. 
(c)  A credit or refund claim submitted by a claimant pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this section must: 
(1)  Identify the name, address and City Tax Identification Number of the taxpayer; and 
(2)  Identify the dollar amount of the credit or refund requested; and 
(3)  Identify the specific tax period involved; and 
(4)  Identify the specific grounds upon which the claim is based. 
(d)  When a written claim for credit or refund is submitted pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this section, no credit shall be allowed or refund paid except for those taxes, penalties, or interest paid in excess of the amount due within the limitation period provided in Section 16-550. The credit or refund limitation period shall be calculated from the date the Tax Collector receives the claimant's written claim meeting the requirements of subsection (c) of this section. 
(e)  The following additional requirements apply to the Tax Collector and the claimant for claims for credit or refund submitted pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this section: 
(1)  The Tax Collector shall notify the claimant that the claim for credit or refund has been received and shall indicate whether the claim meets the requirements of subsection (c) of this section. If the claim does not meet the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, the Tax Collector shall identify the deficiency in writing. Any claim that does not meet the requirements of subsection (c) of this section shall not secure the limitation period pursuant to Section 16-550. 
(2)  The Tax Collector may request, in writing, additional information or documentation from the claimant to support the requested credit or refund. Such information or documentation must be reasonably related to the claim and required to be maintained under this chapter in the normal course of business. 
(A)  The claimant may request in writing one (1) or more extensions to supply the requested information or documentation. The Tax Collector may reject an extension request only by denying the claim in whole or in part, subject to appeal by the claimant pursuant to Section 16-570. 
(B)  A claimant aggrieved by a request for information or documentation under this subsection may file an appeal in the manner provided for in Section 16-570 regarding the scope of the request for information or documentation. Such petition must be filed no later than the last day by which requested information or documentation must be provided to the Tax Collector, including any extensions. The decision of the hearing officer regarding a request for information or documentation may not be appealed by either party until the claim has been approved or denied, in whole or in part, under subsection (h) of this section or through subsubsections (e)(3) or (e)(4) of this section. A claimant shall not be barred from raising the issue of the reasonableness of the Tax Collector's information or documentation request in an appeal filed under subsection (h) of this Section or through subsubsections (e)(3) or (e)(4) of this section through a lack of filing a petition under this subsubsection. 
(3)  If the Tax Collector fails to request additional information or documentation pursuant to this section and fails to issue a determination on any claim for credit or refund within six (6) months after the claim is filed, the claimant may consider the claim denied and may file an appeal pursuant to section 16-570. 
(4)  If the Tax Collector fails to issue a determination within six (6) months of receiving all requested additional information or documentation, the claimant may consider the claim for credit or refund denied and may file an appeal pursuant to Section 16-570. 
(5)  The burden of proof to show that a notice, request, determination or other communication was received by the claimant in this section is on the Tax Collector, and will be satisfied by receipt of notice. The burden of proof to show that a claim or additional information or documentation was received by the Tax Collector is on the claimant and will be satisfied by receipt of notice. 
(f)  Interest shall be allowed on the overpayment of tax for any credit or refund authorized pursuant to subsections (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section at the rate and in the manner set forth in Section 16-540(a) as follows: 
(1)  For credits or refunds authorized pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of this section, interest shall be calculated from the date the Tax Collector receives the claimant's written claim following the date of notice to the claimant authorizing the credit or refund. 
(2)  For credits or refunds authorized pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this section, interest shall be calculated from the date the Tax Collector receives the claimant's written claim meeting the requirements of subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  The Tax Collector shall give the claimant a written notice of determination for a claim made under subsection (b) of this section. If the determination is a denial of a claim, in whole or in part, the determination must state that the claim for credit or refund has been denied in whole or in part, with the reason for denial, and must include the claimant's rights of appeal pursuant to Section 16-570. 
(h)  A determination by the Tax Collector under this section, whether an approval of a claim or a denial of a claim, in whole or in part, shall become final forty-five (45) days from the date of receipt of the notice by the claimant, unless an appeal is made pursuant to Section 16-570. If the claimant is the prevailing party in an appeal of a determination under this section, Section 16-578 shall apply, except that reasonable fees and other costs may be awarded either by the hearing officer or court and are not subject to the monetary limitations of subsection 16-578(e) if the Tax Collector's position was not substantially justified or was brought for the purpose of harassing the claimant, frustrating the credit or refund process or delaying the credit or refund. For the purposes of this section, "reasonable fees and other costs" means fees and other costs that are based on prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the furnished services, not to exceed the amounts actually paid for expert witnesses, the cost of any study, analysis, report, test, project or computer program that is found to be necessary to prepare the claimant's case and necessary fees for attorneys or other representatives. 
(i)  The amendments to this section as enacted in Ordinance No. 2007.20 shall be effective as follows: 
(1)  For any claim for refund or credit received by the Tax Collector before October 1, 2005: 
(A)  The provisions of this section as it existed prior to the adoption of Ordinance No. 2007.20 shall apply, except that interest shall be allowed from and after October 1, 2005 as provided in subsection (f) of this section as enacted by Ordinance No. 2007.20. 
(B)  Except as noted in subsection (1)(a) above, the amendments to this section as enacted in Ordinance No. 2007.20 shall not be cited or considered in the construction or the interpretation of the City Tax Refund or credit provisions, interest provisions, or appeal provisions in effect prior to October 1, 2005. 
(2)  The provisions of this section enacted by Ordinance No. 2007.20 shall apply to all claims for refund or credit, for any periods as determined by subsections (d) or (e) of this section, received by the Tax Collector from and after October 1, 2005, except for claims that, in whole or in part, had been received by the tax collector prior to October 1, 2005. 
(j)  Any refund paid under the provisions of this section shall be paid from the privilege tax revenue accounts. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87; Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96; Ord. No. 2007.20, 4-19-07)  
Sec. 16-565. - Payment of tax by the incorrect taxpayer or to the incorrect Arizona city or town. 
(a)  When it is determined that taxes have been reported and paid to the City by the wrong taxpayer, any taxes erroneously paid shall be transferred by the City to the privilege tax account of the person who actually owes and should have paid such taxes, provided that the City receives an assignment and waiver signed by both the person who actually paid the tax and the person who should have paid the tax. 
(b)  An assignment and waiver provided under this section, must: 
(1)  Identify the name and City Privilege License Number of the person who erroneously paid the tax and the person who should have paid the tax. 
(2)  Provide that the person who erroneously paid the tax waives any right such person may have to a refund of the taxes erroneously paid. 
(3)  Authorize the City to transfer the erroneously paid tax to the privilege tax account of the person who should have paid the tax. 
(c)  When it is determined that taxes have been reported and paid to the wrong Arizona city or town, such taxes shall be remitted to the correct city or town, provided that the city or town to whom the taxes were erroneously paid receives an assignment and waiver signed by both the person who actually paid the tax and the person who should have paid the tax. Where the person who actually paid the tax and the person who should have paid the tax are one (1) and the same, no assignment and waiver need be provided. The City shall neither pay nor charge any interest or penalty on any overpayment or underpayment except such interest and penalty actually paid by the taxpayer relating to such tax. 
(d)  This section in no way limits or restricts the applicability of any remedies which may otherwise be available under A.R.S. § 42-6003. The limitations and procedures set forth in A.R.S. § 42-6003 shall apply to all payments under this section. 
(e)  When reference is made in this section to this City or an Arizona city or town, and payments made to or requested from this City or an Arizona city or town, the provisions shall be applicable to the Arizona Department of Revenue when it is acting for or on behalf of this City or an Arizona city or town.

Sec. 16-570. - Administrative review; petition for hearing or for redetermination; finality of order. 
For the purposes of this section, "Municipal Tax Hearing Office" means the administrative offices of the Municipal Tax Hearing Officer. 
(a)  Informal conference. A taxpayer shall have the right to discuss any proposed assessment with the auditor prior to the issuance of any assessment, but any such informal conference is not required for the taxpayer to file a petition for administrative review. 
(b)  Administrative review. 
(1)  Filing a petition. Other than in the case of a jeopardy assessment, a taxpayer may contest the applicability or amount of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed upon or paid by him pursuant to this chapter by filing a petition for a hearing or for redetermination with the Tax Collector as set forth below: 
(A)  Within forty-five (45) days of receipt by the taxpayer of notice of a determination by the Tax Collector that a tax, penalty, or interest amount is due, or that a request for refund or credit has been denied; or 
(B)  By voluntary payment of any contested amount when accompanied by a timely filed return and a petition requesting a refund of the protested portion of said payment; or 
(C)  By petition accompanying a timely filed return contesting an amount reported but not paid; or 
(D)  By petition requesting review of denial of waiver of penalty as provided in subsection 16-540(g). 
(2)  Extension to file a petition. In all cases, the taxpayer may request an extension from the Tax Collector. Such request must be in writing, state the reasons for the requested delay and must be filed with the Tax Collector within the period allowed above for originally filing a petition. The Tax Collector shall allow a forty-five (45) day extension to file a petition when such written request has been properly and timely made by the taxpayer. The Tax Collector may grant an additional extension and may determine the corresponding time of any such extension at his sole discretion. 
(3)  Requirements for petition. 
(A)  The petition shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons why any correction, abatement, or refund should be granted, and the amount of reduction or refund requested. The petition may be amended at any time prior to the time the taxpayer rests his case at the hearing or such time as the hearing officer allows for submitting of amendments in cases of redeterminations without hearings. The hearing officer may require that amendments be in writing, and in that case, he shall provide a reasonable period of time to file the amendment. The hearing officer shall provide a reasonable period of time for the Tax Collector to review and respond to the petition and to any written amendments. 
(B)  The taxpayer, as part of the petition, may request a hearing which shall be granted by the hearing officer. If no request for hearing is made the petition shall be considered to be submitted for decision by the hearing officer on the matters contained in the petition and in any reply made by the Tax Collector. 
(C)  The provisions of this section are exclusive, and no petition seeking any correction, abatement, or refund shall be considered unless the petition is timely and properly filed under this section. 
(4)  Transmittal to hearing officer. The City shall designate a hearing officer, who may be other than an employee of the City. The Tax Collector, if designated to receive petitions, shall forward any petition to the Municipal Tax Hearing Office (MTHO) within twenty (20) days after receipt, accompanied by documentation as to timeliness. In cases where the hearing officer determines that the petition is not timely or not in proper form, he shall notify both the taxpayer and the Tax Collector; and in cases of petitions not in proper form only, the hearing officer shall provide the taxpayer with an extension up to forty-five (45) days to correct the petition. 
(5)  Hearings shall be conducted by a hearing officer and shall be continuous until the hearing officer closes the record. The taxpayer may be heard in person or by his authorized representative at such hearing. Hearings shall be conducted informally as to the order of proceeding and presentation of evidence. The hearing officer shall admit evidence over hearsay objections where the offered evidence has substantial probative value and reliability. Further, copies of records and documents prepared in the ordinary course of business may be admitted, without objection as to foundation, but subject to argument as to weight, admissibility, and authenticity. Summary accounting records may be admitted subject to satisfactory proof of the reliability of the summaries. In all cases, the decision of the hearing officer shall be made solely upon substantial and reliable evidence. All expenses incurred in the hearing shall be paid by the party incurring the same. 
(6)  Redeterminations upon a "petition for redetermination" shall follow the same conditions, except that no oral hearing shall be held. 
(7)  Hearing ruling. In either case, the hearing officer shall issue his ruling not later than forty-five (45) days after the close of the record by the hearing officer. 
(8)  Notice of refund or adjusted assessment. Within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the hearing officer's decision, the Tax Collector shall issue to the taxpayer either a notice of refund or an adjusted assessment recalculated to conform to the hearing officer's decision. 
(c)  Stipulations that future tax is also protested. A taxpayer may enter into a stipulation with the Tax Collector that future taxes of similar nature are also at issue in any protest or appeal. However, unless such stipulation is made, it is presumed that the protest or appeal deals solely and exclusively with the tax specifically protested and no other. When a taxpayer enters into such a stipulation with the Tax Collector that future taxes of similar nature will be included in any redetermination, hearing, or court case, it is the burden of that taxpayer to identify, segregate, and keep record of such income or protested taxable amount in his books and records in the same manner as the taxpayer is required to segregate exempt income. 
(d)  When an assessment is final. 
(1)  If a request for administrative review and petition for hearing or redetermination of an assessment made by the Tax Collector is not filed within the period required by subsection (b) above, such person shall be deemed to have waived and abandoned the right to question the amount determined to be due and any tax, interest, or penalty determined to be due shall be final as provided in subsections 16-545(a) and 16-555(f). 
(2)  The decision made by the hearing officer upon administrative review by hearing or redetermination shall become final thirty (30) days after the taxpayer receives the notice of refund or adjusted assessment required by subsection (b)(8) above, unless the taxpayer appeals the order or decision in the manner provided in Section 16-575. 
(e)  Reserved. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87; Ord. No. 90.25, 7-12-90; Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96; Ord. No. 2001.16, 7-26-01; Ord. No. 2010.09, 5-6-10)  
Sec. 16-571. - Jeopardy assessments. 
(a)  If the Tax Collector believes that the collection of any assessment or deficiency of any amounts imposed by this chapter will be jeopardized by delay, he shall deliver to the taxpayer a notice of such finding and demand immediate payment of the tax or deficiency declared to be in jeopardy, including interest, penalties, and additions. 
(b)  Jeopardy assessments are immediately due and payable, and the Tax Collector may immediately begin proceedings for collection. The taxpayer, however, may stay collection by filing, within ten (10) days after receipt of notice of jeopardy assessment, or within such additional time as the Tax Collector may allow, by bond or collateral in favor of the City in the amount Tax Collector declared to be in jeopardy in his notice. 
(c)  "Bond or collateral", as required by this section: 
(1)  Shall mean either: 
(A)  A bond issued in favor of the City by a surety company authorized to transact business in this State and approved by the Director of Insurance as to solvency and responsibility, or 
(B)  Collateral composed of securities or cash which are deposited with, and kept in the custody of, the Tax Collector. 
(2)  Shall be of such form that it may, at any time without notice, be applied to any tax, penalties, or interest due and payable for the purposes of this chapter. Securities held as collateral by the Tax Collector must be of a nature that they may be sold at public or private sale without notice to the taxpayer. 
(d)  If bond or collateral is not filed within the period prescribed by subsection (b) above, the Tax Collector may treat the assessment as final for purposes of any collection proceedings. The taxpayer nevertheless shall be afforded the appeal rights provided in Sections 16-570 and 16-575. The filing of a petition by the taxpayer under Section 16-570, however, shall not stay the Tax Collector's rights to pursue any collection proceedings. 
(e)  If the taxpayer timely files sufficient bond or collateral, the jeopardy requirements are deemed satisfied, and the taxpayer may avail himself of the provisions of Section 16-570, including requests for additional time to file a petition. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87; Ord. No. 88.32, § 1(15), 4-28-88)  
Sec. 16-572. - Expedited review of jeopardy assessments. 
(a)  Within thirty (30) days after the day on which the Tax Collector furnishes the written notice required by Section 16-571(a), the taxpayer, pursuant to Section 16-570, may request the Tax Collector to review the action taken. Within fifteen (15) days after the request for review, the Tax Collector shall determine whether both the jeopardy determination and the amount assessed are reasonable. 
(b)  Within thirty (30) days after the Tax Collector notifies the taxpayer of the determination he reached pursuant to subsection (a) above, the taxpayer may bring a civil action in the appropriate court. If the taxpayer so requests, the City shall stipulate to an accelerated and expedited resolution of the civil action. If the court determines that either the jeopardy determination or the amount assessed is unreasonable, the court may order the Tax Collector to abate the assessment, to redetermine any part of the amount assessed or to take such other action as the court finds to be appropriate. A determination made by the court under this subsection is final except as provided in A.R.S. § 12-170. 
(Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96)  
Sec. 16-575. - Judicial review. 
(a)  A taxpayer may seek judicial review of all or any part of a hearing officer's decision by initiating an action against the City in the appropriate court of this county. A taxpayer is not required to pay any tax, penalty, or interest upheld by the hearing officer before seeking such judicial review. 
(b)  The Tax Collector may seek judicial review of all or any part of a hearing officer's decision by initiating an action in the appropriate court of this county. 
(c)  An action for judicial review cannot be commenced by either the taxpayer or the Tax Collector more than thirty (30) days after receipt by the taxpayer of notice of any refund or assessment recalculated or reduced to conform to the hearing officer's decision, unless the time to commence such an action is extended in writing signed by both the taxpayer and the Tax Collector. Failure to bring the action within thirty (30) days or such other time as is agreed upon in writing shall constitute a waiver of any right to judicial review, except as provided in subsection (f) below. 
(d)  The court shall hear and determine the appeal as a trial de novo; however, the Tax Collector cannot raise in the court any grounds or basis for the assessment not asserted before the hearing officer. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall preclude the Tax Collector from responding to any arguments which are raised by the taxpayer in the appeal. 
(e)  The City has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence in any court proceeding regarding any factual issue relevant to ascertaining the tax liability of a taxpayer. This subsection does not abrogate any requirement of this chapter that requires a taxpayer to substantiate an item of gross income, exclusion, exemption, deduction, or credit. This subsection applies to a factual issue if a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that: 
(1)  The taxpayer asserts a reasonable dispute regarding the issue. 
(2)  The taxpayer has fully cooperated with the Tax Collector regarding the issue, including providing within a reasonable period of time, access to and inspection of all witnesses, information and documents within the taxpayer's control, as reasonably requested by the Tax Collector. 
(3)  The taxpayer has kept and maintained records as required by the City. 
(f)  The issuance of an adjusted or corrected assessment or notice of refund due to the taxpayer, where made by the Tax Collector pursuant to the decision of the hearing officer, shall not be deemed an acquiescence by the City or the Tax Collector in said decision, nor shall it constitute a bar or estoppel to the institution of an action or counterclaim by the City to recover any amounts claimed to be due to it by virtue of the original assessment. 
(g)  After the initiation of any action in the appropriate court by either party, the opposite party may file such counterclaim as would be allowed pursuant to the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87; Ord. No. 96.42, 12-12-96; Ord. No. 99.40, 12-16-99)  
Sec. 16-577. - Refunds of taxes paid under protest. 
In the event the hearing officer's decision or a final judgment by the court is rendered in favor of the taxpayer to recover protested taxes, it shall be the duty of the Tax Collector, upon receipt of such decision or of a certified copy of such final judgment, to authorize a warrant in favor of the taxpayer in an amount equal to the amount of the tax found by such decision or by the final judgment to have been paid under protest, and such warrant shall include the amount of interest or other cost that may have been recovered against the City by the final judgment in such action in the courts, to be paid from the privilege tax revenue accounts. 
(Ord. No. 87.17, § 1, 4-23-87)  
Sec. 16-578. - Reimbursement of fees and other costs; definitions. 
(a)  A taxpayer who is a prevailing party may be reimbursed for reasonable fees and other costs related to any administrative proceeding brought by the taxpayer pursuant to Section 16-570(b). For purposes of this section, a taxpayer is considered to be the prevailing party only if both of the following are true: 
(1)  The Tax Collector's position was not substantially justified. 
(2)  The taxpayer prevails as to the most significant issue or set of issues. 
(b)  Reimbursement under this section may be denied if any of the following circumstances apply: 
(1)  During the course of the proceeding the taxpayer unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter. 
(2)  The reason that the taxpayer prevailed is due to an intervening change in the applicable law. 
(c)  The taxpayer shall present an itemization of the reasonable fees and other costs to the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer within thirty (30) days after receipt by the taxpayer of a notice of refund or recalculated assessment issued by the Tax Collector pursuant to Section 16-570(b)(8). The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer shall determine the validity of the fees and other costs within thirty (30) days after receiving the itemization. The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer's decision is considered a final decision. Either the taxpayer or the Tax Collector may seek judicial review of the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer's decision. An action for judicial review, however, shall not be commenced more than thirty (30) days after receipt of the resolution officer's decision. 
(d)  In the event judicial review is not sought pursuant to subsection (c) above, the City shall pay the fees and other costs awarded as provided in this section within thirty (30) days after demand by a person who has received an award pursuant to this section. 
(e)  Reimbursement to a taxpayer under this section shall not exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) or actual monies spent, whichever is less. The reimbursable attorney or representative fees shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) per hour or actual monies spent, whichever is less, unless the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or representatives for the proceeding involved justifies a higher fee. 
(f)  For purposes of this section "reasonable fees and other costs" means fees and other costs that are based on prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the furnished services, but not exceeding the amounts actually spent for expert witnesses, the cost of any study, analysis, report, test or project that is found to be necessary to prepare the party's case and necessary fees for attorneys or other representatives.

Sec. 16-590. - Civil actions. 
(a)  Liens. 
(1)  Any tax, penalty, or interest imposed under this chapter which has become final, as provided in this chapter, shall become a lien when the City perfects a notice and claim of lien setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalty, and interest, the period or periods for which the same is due, and the date of accrual thereof, the amount of the recording costs by the County Recorder in any county in which the taxpayer owns real property and the documentation and lien processing fees imposed by the City Council and further, stating that the City claims a lien therefor. 
(2)  The notice of claim of lien shall be signed by the Management Services Director or his designee under his official seal or the official seal of the City, and, with respect to real property, shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder of any county in which the taxpayer owns real property, and, with respect to personal property shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. After the notice and claim of lien is recorded or filed, the taxes, penalties, interest and recording costs and lien processing fees referred to above in the amounts specified therein shall be a lien on all real property of the taxpayer located in such county where recorded, and all tangible personal property of the taxpayer within the State, superior to all other liens and assessments recorded or filed subsequent to the recording or filing of the notice and claim of lien. 
(3)  Every tax and any increases, interest, penalties, and recording costs and lien processing fees referred to above, shall become from the time the same is due and payable a personal debt from the person liable to the City, but shall be payable to and recoverable by the Tax Collector and which may be collected in the manner set forth in subsection (b) below. 
(4)  Any lien perfected pursuant to this section shall, upon payment of the taxes, penalties, interest, recording costs and lien processing fees referred to above and lien release fees imposed by the County Recorder in any county in which the lien was recorded, thereby, be released by the Tax Collector in the same manner as mortgages and judgments are released.

(b)  Actions to recover tax. An action may be brought by the City Attorney or other legal advisor to the City designated by the City Council, at the request of the Tax Collector, in the name of the City, to recover the amount of any taxes, penalties, interest, recording costs, lien processing fees and lien release fees due under this chapter; provided that:

(2)  Such collection effort is made or the proceedings begun: 
(A)  Within six (6) years after the assessment of the tax; or

(a)  In addition to any remedy provided elsewhere in the City Code that may apply, the Tax Collector may apply the provisions of subsections (b) through (d) below concerning the collection of taxes when there is succession in and/or cessation of business. 
(b)  The taxes imposed by this chapter are a lien on the property of any person subject to this chapter who sells his business or stock of goods, or quits his business, if the person fails to make a final return and payment of the tax within fifteen (15) days after selling or quitting his business. 
(c)  Any person who purchases, or who acquires by foreclosure, by sale under trust deed or warranty deed in lieu of foreclosure, or by any other method, improved real property or a portion of improved real property for which the Privilege Tax imposed by this chapter has not been paid shall be responsible for payment of such tax as a speculative builder or owner-builder, as provided in Sections 16-416 and 16-417. 
(1)  Any person who is a creditor or an affiliate of creditor, who acquires improved real property directly or indirectly from the creditor's debtor by any means set forth in this subsection, shall pay the tax based on the amount received by the creditor or its affiliate in a subsequent sale of such improved real property to a party unrelated to the creditor, regardless of when such subsequent sale takes place. Such tax shall be due in the month following the month in which the sale of the improved real property by the creditor or its affiliate occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the real property meets the definition of partially improved residential real property in Section 16-416(a)(4) and all of the requirements of Section 16-416(b)(4) are met by the parties to the subsequent sale transaction, then the tax shall not apply to the subsequent sale. 
(2)  In the event a creditor or its affiliate uses the acquired improved real property for any business purpose, other than operating the property in the manner in which it was operated, or was intended to be operated, before the acquisition or in any other manner unrelated to selling the property, the tax shall be due. The gross income upon which the tax shall be determined pursuant to sections 16-416 and 16-417 shall be the fair market value of the improved real property as of the date of acquisition. The tax shall be due in the month following the month in which such first business use occurs. When applicable, the credit bid shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the property as of the date of acquisition. 
(3)  Once the subsequent sale by the creditor or its affiliate has occurred and the creditor or its affiliate has paid the tax due from it pursuant to this subsection, neither the creditor nor its affiliate, nor any future owner, shall be liable for any outstanding tax, penalties or interest that may continue to be due from the debtor based on the transfer from the debtor to the creditor or its affiliate. 
(4)  If the tax liability imposed by either Section 16-416 or Section 16-417 on the transfer of the improved real property to the creditor or its affiliate, or any part thereof, is paid to the tax collector by the debtor subsequent to payment of the tax by the creditor or its affiliate, the amount so paid may constitute a credit, as equitably determined by the Tax Collector in good faith, against the tax imposed on the creditor or its affiliate by either paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of this subsection. 
(5)  Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, if a creditor or its affiliate is subject to tax as described in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of this subsection and such creditor or affiliate has not previously been required to be licensed, such creditor or affiliate shall become licensed no later than the date on which the tax is due. 
(d)  A person's successors or assignees shall withhold from the purchase money an amount sufficient to cover the taxes required to be paid, and interest or penalties due and payable, until the former owner produces a receipt from the Tax Collector showing that all City Tax has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due as then shown by the records of the Tax Collector. The Tax Collector shall respond to a request from the seller for a certificate within fifteen (15) days by either providing the certificate or a written notice stating why the certificate cannot be issued. 
(1)  If a subsequent audit shows a deficiency arising before the sale of the business, the deficiency is an obligation of the seller and does not constitute a liability against a buyer who has received a certificate from the Tax Collector. 
(2)  If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to obtain a certificate as provided by this section, he is personally liable for payment of the amount of taxes required to be paid by the former owner on account of the business so purchased, with interest and penalties accrued by the former owner or assignees.

Sec. 16-596. - Agreement for installment payments of tax. 
(a)  The City may enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to allow the taxpayer to satisfy a liability for any tax imposed by this chapter by means of installment payments. The Tax Collector may require a taxpayer who requests an installment payment agreement to complete a financial report in such form and manner as the Tax Collector may prescribe. 
(b)  The Tax Collector, without notice, may alter, modify or terminate an installment payment agreement if the taxpayer: 
(1)  Fails to pay an installment at the time the installment payment is due under the agreement. 
(2)  Fails to pay any other tax liability at the time the liability is due.

(6)  Provides inaccurate, false or incomplete information to the Tax Collector. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any installment payment agreement, the Tax Collector may offset any tax refunds against the liabilities provided for in the installment payment agreement, may file and perfect any tax liens and, in the event the taxpayer breaches any term or provision of the installment payment agreement, may engage in collection activities. 
(d)  The Tax Collector, without notice, may terminate an installment payment agreement if the Tax Collector believes that the collection of tax to which the payment agreement pertains is in jeopardy. 
(e)  If the Tax Collector determines that the financial condition of a taxpayer has improved, the Tax Collector may alter, modify or terminate the agreement by providing notice to the taxpayer at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the action. The notice shall include the reasons why the Tax Collector believes the alteration, modification or termination is appropriate. 
(f)  An installment payment agreement shall remain in effect for the term of the agreement except as otherwise provided in this section. 
(g)  A taxpayer who is aggrieved by a decision of the Tax Collector to refuse to enter into an installment payment agreement or to alter, modify or terminate an agreement entered into pursuant to this section may petition the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer to review that determination. The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer may stay such alteration, modification or termination pending its review and may modify or nullify the determination. 
(h)  The City and the taxpayer may modify any installment payment agreement at any time by entering into a new or modified agreement.

Sec. 20-1. - Declaration of policy. 
It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City to prohibit unnecessary, excessive and annoying noises from all sources subject to its police power. At certain levels noises are detrimental to the health and welfare of the citizenry and in the public interests shall be systematically proscribed. 
(Code 1967, § 19A-l)  
Sec. 20-2. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
"A" band level means the total sound level of all noise as measured with a sound level meter using A-weighting network. The unit is the dB(A). 
Ambient noise means the all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment, being usually a composite of sounds from many sources, near and far. For the purpose of this chapter, ambient noise level is the level obtained when the noise level is averaged over a period of fifteen (15) minutes without inclusion of noise from isolated identifiable sources, at the location and time of day near that at which a comparison is to be made. Averaging may be done by instrumental analysis in accordance with American National Standard S. 13-1971, or may be done manually as follows: 
(1)  Observe a sound level meter for five (5) seconds and record the best estimate of central tendency of the indicator needle, and the highest and lowest indications. 
(2)  Repeat the observations as many times as necessary to ensure that observations are made at the beginning and the end of the fifteen (15) minute averaging period and that there are at least as many additional observations as there are decibels between the highest high indication and the lowest low indication. 
(3)  Calculate the arithmetical average of the observed central tendency indications. 
Decibel means a sound pressure that is twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of sound to the reference pressure, 2 × 10 —5 Newton/meter 2 . 
Emergency work means work made necessary to restore property to a safe condition following a public calamity or work required to protect the health, safety or welfare of persons or property or work by private or public utilities when restoring utility service. 
Frequency. "Frequency" of a function periodic in time shall mean the reciprocal of the primitive period. The unit is the hertz and shall be specified. 
Impulse noise means a noise of short duration, usually less than one (1) second, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay. 
Microbar means a unit of pressure commonly used in acoustics and is equal to one (1) dyne per square centimeter. 
Motor vehicles means any self-propelled vehicle operated within the City, including but not limited to licensed or unlicensed vehicles, automobiles, minibikes, go-carts and motorcycles. 
Period. "Period" of a periodic quantity shall mean the smallest increment of time for which the function repeats itself. 
Periodic quantity means oscillating quantity, the values of which recur for equal increments of time. 
Pure tone noise means any noise which is distinctly audible as a single pitch (frequency) or set of pitches as determined by the enforcement officer. 
Sound level. "Sound level" (noise level), in decibels (dB) is the sound measured with the A - weighting and slow response by a sound level meter. 
Sound level meter means an instrument including a microphone, an amplifier, an output meter, and frequency weighting networks for the measurement of sound levels which satisfies the pertinent requirements in American Standard Specifications for Sound Level Meters S1.4-1971 or the most recent revision thereof.

ARTICLE II. - SMOKING POLLUTION CONTROL  
DIVISION 1. - REGULATION OF SMOKING 
 
Sec. 22-40. - Purpose. 
(a)  The smoking of tobacco or any plant is a positive danger to the health and a material annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort and health hazard to those who are present in confined spaces. 
(b)  Electronic smoking devices, which first entered the United States market in 2007, are electronic inhalers meant to simulate cigarette smoking. Electronic smoking devices use a heating element that vaporizes a liquid solution. Many electronic smoking devices release nicotine, a highly addictive substance, while some merely release flavored vapor. They are designed to mimic traditional smoking implements in their use and appearance. Although the long-term effects of electronic smoking devices may require further study, the United States Food and Drug Administration has found that some devices contain toxins and carcinogens and has expressed concerns about their safety. Use of electronic smoking devices, particularly in places where smoking is prohibited, may interfere with smokers' attempts to quit by making it easier for them to maintain their nicotine addiction. Children and youth who experiment with electronic smoking devices may become addicted to nicotine and ultimately switch to smoking cigarettes. 
(c)  Therefore, in order to serve the public health, safety and welfare, the declared purpose of this article is to restrict smoking within enclosed places, in particular, public places and places of employment.

(3)  Carrying or placing of a lighted cigarette or lighted cigar or lighted pipe or any other lighted smoking equipment in one's hands or any appendage or devices and allowing smoke to diffuse in the air; or 
(4)  Using an electronic smoking device designed for the purpose of inhaling and exhaling aerosol or vapor.

(Ord. No. 88.85, 1-12-89)  
Sec. 25-122. - Undergrounding of overhead utility lines. 
(a)  All new or existing utility lines fronting onto the on-site development/redevelopment, other than transmission lines, shall be placed underground in conjunction with a development/redevelopment project (other than an existing detached, single family dwelling) that has been submitted for approval under the provision of the Tempe City Code. This requirement shall also apply to primary distribution lines and all communication lines, including underbuild on transmission poles. If there is a deferment or a waiver, new aerial communication lines, including upgraded replacement lines, will not be allowed to be underbuilt on existing utility poles, except for communication lines installed on transmission poles in the static neutral position. The required undergrounding shall be completed prior to approval and occupancy of the project. 
(b)  The (re)developer or owner of a (re)development project shall be responsible to make necessary arrangements with the affected utility companies for the installation of required underground facilities, including arrangements for the payment of any cost, as one (1) of the conditions of plan approval. Nothing contained herein is intended to obligate a providing utility company to install such underground facilities without reimbursement except where the utility company is acting as a (re)developer. 
(c)  In those instances where poles to be removed include street lights, the street lights will be replaced with freestanding poles and luminaries by the (re)developer in accordance with the approved street light standards or agreements of the serving utility. 
(d)  Where utility lines are to be installed, said lines shall be installed underground where existing utilities are already underground. Previously installed lines shall be undergrounded in concert with utilities at the time the facilities are undergrounded. No additional poles or longer poles will be permitted in the streets or public right-of-way for any new aerial lines. If the utility company installs aerial lines on existing poles as provided herein, the utility company shall bury its lines if such poles are removed and not replaced in kind. The undergrounding requirement shall also apply to all situations where utility companies plan a new or upgraded system that results in more conductors or lines on a pole. Individual pole mounted equipment shall not be considered an upgrade, such as transformers, switches, splice cases and capacitor banks. The cost for this undergrounding is to be borne by the affected utility company. If there is a deferment or a waiver, all new aerial communication lines, including upgraded replacement lines, will not be allowed to be underbuilt on existing utility poles except for lines installed in the static neutral position. 
(e)  The undergrounding requirement shall apply to all situations where a governmental agency is acting as a (re)developer or has initiated a construction effort which requires the relocation of existing overhead utility lines. Nothing contained herein is intended to obligate a providing utility company to install such underground facilities without reimbursement from the governmental agency for any costs in excess of those not already the obligation of the utility company. 
(f)  Where utility lines are required to be placed underground due to a combination of needs generated by (re)development, utility system upgrade, and governmental improvement projects, there shall be an equitable sharing of the cost of that undergrounding effort. 
(g)  The undergrounding requirement shall not apply to the normal maintenance and repair of existing utility poles and lines. Replacement poles shall not be higher than the existing pole, with the exception of a wood pole being replaced with a steel pole that is closest in height of the wood pole. Temporary overhead line installations used to facilitate construction projects, maintenance activities or emergency restoration of power and communications will be allowed subject to approval of the City Engineer. 
(h)  The undergrounding requirements shall apply regardless of the existence of easements for overhead lines. 
(i)  Equipment appurtenant to the underground facilities, such as surface-mounted transformers, pull boxes, pedestal cabinets, service terminals, telephone splice closures, concealed ducts, or other similar on-the-ground facilities normally used with or as part of an underground utility system, may be maintained above ground. The city maintains the right to approve the location and appearance of all surface-mounted communication equipment. 
(j)  The undergrounding requirements of this article shall not apply to electrical transmission lines. 
(k)  To prevent unnecessary disruption and damage to streets, right-of-way, and other property, the installation of lines shall be accomplished concurrently in the new subdivisions, and use the same trench as other communications, electric and other permanent services to structures. 
(Ord. No. 88.85, 1-12-89; Ord. No. 2000.14, 6-8-00; Ord. No. 2008.13, 4-3-08; Ord. No. O2014.30, 7-31-14)  
Sec. 25-123. - Deferments of undergrounding. 
(a)  Deferment of undergrounding off-site lines may be requested from the City Engineer for a (re)development with small frontage, where the cost is substantially more per unit length than it would otherwise be if a longer length (usually a minimum of six hundred sixty (660) feet), including the (re)development frontage, were being undergrounded at the same time. At all times, on-site lines shall be placed underground. 
A request for deferment shall be requested in writing to the City Engineer and include the following: 
(1)  The (re)developer shall procure from the appropriate utility companies a reliable estimate of the current cost for undergrounding what is required along the (re)development frontage, including new and existing lines in the adjacent off-site frontage. 
(2)  The (re)developer shall procure from the appropriate utility companies a reliable estimate of the current cost for undergrounding a longer, more practical length that includes the (re)development frontage (usually a minimum of six hundred sixty (660) feet). 
(3)  If the project involves improvements in the public right-of-way (bike paths, sidewalks, landscaping, etc.) and deferment of undergrounding will involve costs of future restoration of those improvements, the (re)developer shall furnish a reliable estimate of such future restoration costs in current dollars. 
(b)  In reviewing a request for deferment, the City Engineer shall consider the costs of installing overhead utilities, the cost of undergrounding the utilities, and the status of development in the area affected by the request. 
(c)  If deferment is authorized by the City Engineer, the (re)developer shall deposit with the City a sum sufficient to cover all deferred construction required herein. Monies received shall be used by the City for undergrounding utilities associated with (re)developments within the city boundaries. 
(d)  Utility companies may request deferment of undergrounding for power or communication line extensions through undeveloped areas. The request with justification shall be submitted to the City Engineer. No deferred compensation fees will be required for this type of deferment. 
(e)  If deferment is denied by the City Engineer, the (re)developer or utility company may appeal the City Engineer's decision to the City Council. 
(f)  If deferment is approved by the City Engineer, an interested party who is affected by the decision may appeal the decision to the City Council. 
(Ord. No. 88.85, 1-12-89; Ord. No. O2014.30, 7-31-14)  
Sec. 25-124. - Waiver of undergrounding. 
(a)  The requirement for undergrounding may be waived for the following reasons: 
(1)  When the (re)developer or utility company can show that the costs are unreasonably disproportionate to the costs for the proposed (re)development or utility company project. 
(2)  New utility poles and wires erected for purely temporary purposes, such as providing temporary building construction power, emergency power, telephone service or the furnishing of power to temporary outdoor activities. A permit for such temporary use shall be obtained from the City. The length of the temporary use shall be specified in the permit and may not exceed twelve (12) months. An additional six (6) month permit may be issued upon a finding of necessity by the City. 
(3)  Poles or luminaries, but not wires or other conduits, used exclusively for street lighting. 
(b)  Requests for a waiver to the undergrounding requirements shall be submitted in writing to the City Engineer. 
(c)  In reviewing a request for waiver, the City Engineer shall consider the cost of installing overhead utilities, the costs of undergrounding the utilities, and the status of development in the area of the request. 
(d)  If a waiver is denied by the City Engineer, the (re)developer or utility company may appeal the City Engineer's decision to the City Council. 
(e)  If a waiver is approved by the City Engineer, an interested party who is affected by the decision may appeal the decision to the City Council. 
(Ord. No. 88.85, 1-12-89; Ord. No. O2014.30, 7-31-14)  
Sec. 25-125. - Waiver for alternate plan. 
The City Council may waive portions or all of this article when a developer, utility company or governmental agency presents an alternate plan, which must provide greater public benefit than would be accomplished by a strict application of this article. 
(Ord. No. 88.85, 1-12-89; Ord. No. 2012.14, 3-22-12)  
Sec. 25-126. - Penalty for violation. 
Any person, developer, or utility company firm or corporation who shall violate any of the provisions of this article shall be fined an investigative assessment fee as outlined in Section 29-18 and Appendix A Section 29-19 engineering fees. Each day of violation which is continued shall be a separate violation. In addition, any permits will be either revoked or held until such remedies are completed. These assessments shall be in addition to and not exclusive of all other remedies provided by law.

A written determination shall be signed by the procurement officer and the Procurement Administrator citing the reasons why a shorter time frame is necessary. 
(d)  Solicitation amendment. If a solicitation is changed by a solicitation amendment, the procurement officer shall notify suppliers to whom the procurement officer distributed the solicitation. It is the responsibility of the offeror to obtain any solicitation amendments. An offeror shall acknowledge receipt of an amendment in the manner specified in the solicitation or solicitation amendment on or before the offer due date and time. A procurement officer shall issue a solicitation amendment to do any or all of the following: 
(1)  Make changes in the solicitation; 
(2)  Correct defects or ambiguities; 
(3)  Provide additional information or instructions; or 
(4)  Extend the offer due date and time, if the procurement officer determines that an extension is in the best interest of the City. 
(e)  Late bids . A bid, modification or withdrawal is late if it is received at the location designated in the invitation for bids after the time and date set for bid opening. A late bid, modification or withdrawal shall be rejected unless the bid, modification or withdrawal would have been timely received but for the action or inaction of procurement personnel and is received before contract award. A late bid shall not be opened, except (if necessary), for identification purposes. Delivery and return of late bids shall be handled in the following manner: 
(1)  If hand delivered, a late bid shall be time and date stamped, refused and returned to the bidder with a late bid notice placed in the bid file. A copy of the front envelope or box cover showing the time and date stamp shall be made and retained in the procurement file; 
(2)  If delivered by mail or electronically delivered , the bid shall be time and date stamped and filed unopened within the procurement file or e-file for thirty (30) days. The Procurement Administrator may discard the document thirty (30) days after the recorded date unless the bidder requests the document be returned; 
(3)  A late bid notice shall be mailed or electronically sent to the late bidder; and 
(4)  The Procurement Office shall determine the method for bid issuance and for acceptable response delivery and so state in the invitation for bids document. 
(f)  Bid opening . Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one (1) or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. If the bids have been filed on-line in an electronic format then the opening will be effective upon the opening date and time specified. The amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as the Procurement Administrator deems appropriate, together with the name of each bidder shall be recorded. This record shall be open to public inspection. The bids shall not be opened for public inspection until after a contract is awarded. After contract award, the bids shall be available for public inspection, except to the extent that the withholding of information is permitted or required by law. If the bidder designates a portion of its bid as confidential, it shall isolate and identify in writing the confidential portions in accordance with procedures set forth in this chapter, but the City remains subject to the Arizona public records law requirements. Prior to the scheduled opening, the procurement department may open an unidentified offer to identify the solicitation number and offeror. If this occurs, the staff member shall record the reason for opening the offer, the date and time the offer was opened, and the solicitation number. The offer shall be secured and retained for public opening. 
(g)  Bid acceptance and bid evaluation . Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration, correction, or amendment except as authorized in this chapter. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitations for bids. No criteria may be used in the bid evaluation that is not set forth in the invitation for bids. 
(h)  Correction or withdrawal of bids prior to award . Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening may be permitted where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written notice received in the Procurement Office prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening corrections in bids shall be permitted only to the extent that the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a non-judgmental character was made and that the mistake and the intended offer are evident in the uncorrected offer; for example, an error in the extension of unit prices. After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the City or fair competition shall be permitted. All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids shall be supported by a written determination made by the procurement officer and approved by the Procurement Administrator. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if: 
(1)  The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or 
(2)  The bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. 
(i)  Mistakes discovered after award—Contractor responsibility. If a mistake in the offer is discovered after the award, the offeror may request withdrawal or correction in writing and shall include all of the following in the written request: 
(1)  Explanation of the mistake and any other relevant information; 
(2)  A request for correction including the corrected offer or a request for withdrawal; and 
(3)  The reasons why correction or withdrawal is consistent with fair competition and in the best interest of the City. 
(j)  Mistakes discovered after award—City's responsibility. Based on the considerations of fair competition and the best interest of the City, the Procurement Administrator may: 
(1)  Allow correction of the mistake, if the resulting dollar amount of the correction is less than the next lowest offer; 
(2)  Cancel all or part of the award; or 
(3)  Deny correction or withdrawal. 
(k)  Mistakes discovered after award—Re-award option. After cancellation of all or part of an award, if the offer acceptance period has not expired, the Procurement Administrator may award all or part of the contract to the next lowest responsible and responsive offeror, based on the considerations of fair competition and the best interest of the City. Any decision that allows for the correction of a mistake or the cancellation of a contract shall be supported by a written determination made by the procurement officer and approved by the Procurement Administrator. 
(l)  Extension of offer acceptance period. To extend the offer acceptance period, a procurement officer shall notify offerors in writing of an extension and request written concurrence from all offerors. To be eligible for a contract award, an offeror shall submit written concurrence to the extension. The procurement officer shall not consider the offer from an offeror who fails to respond to the notice of extension. 
(m)  Contract award . The contract shall be awarded in accordance with Section 26A-5 on the recommendation of the Procurement Administrator with appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid conforms in all material respects to requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids: 
(1)  In evaluating the bids, and for purposes of determining the low bidder, the Procurement Office shall include the amount of applicable business privilege tax for all offerors, except that the amount of City of Tempe business privilege tax shall not be included in the evaluation. Tempe privilege tax that is to be paid (returned) to the City shall be considered as a pass-through cost and calculated as zero expense to the City for evaluation purposes. In the event an offer is received from an out of state vendor who does not possess an Arizona transaction privilege tax license then for evaluation purposes only, sales taxes will not be considered for any bidder in determining the awarded firm. 
(2)  In the event the low responsive and responsible bid for a purchase exceeds available funds as certified by the procurement officer and budget office, and such bid does not exceed such funds by more than five percent (5%), the Procurement Office is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude re-solicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. Any such negotiated adjustment shall be based only upon eliminating independent deductive items specified in the invitation for bids; 
(3)  After contract award, bids shall be available for public inspection, except to the extent that the withholding of information is permitted or required by law. If the bidder designates a portion of its bid as confidential, it shall isolate and identify in writing the confidential portions as designated in the definition of confidential information, but the City remains subject to the Arizona public records law. A brief summary of the bid being recommended for award and competing bids will be included in the request for Council action and published to the City's external web site up to five (5) days prior to the City Council meeting. All other bids including evaluation information shall remain confidential until after award; 
(4)  The City, at its option, may not recommend for award the bid of a vendor who is in default on the payment of City taxes, licenses or other monies due the City at the time of bid opening; 
(5)  The City, at its option, may not recommend for award the bid of a vendor who has defaulted on a previous contract with the City; or has defaulted on a similar contract with another jurisdiction or public entity during a past three (3) year period; 
(6)  If there are two (2) or more low responsive bids from responsible bidders that are identical in price and that meet all the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids, award may be made by a coin toss; and 
(7)  The Procurement Office shall procure recycled materials in accord with ordinances, resolutions and administrative directives of the City. 
(Ord. No. 97.55, 12-11-97; Ord. No. 2007.72, 10-25-07; Ord. No. 2008.63, 11-6-08; Ord. No. O2016.61, 11-3-16)  
Sec. 26A-7. - Multi-step sealed bidding. 
(a)  General. When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a specification to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. 
(b)  Multi-step sealed bidding. Multi-step sealed bidding shall be initiated by the issuance of an invitation for bids. The multi-step invitation for bids shall state: 
(1)  That unpriced technical offers are requested; 
(2)  Whether priced bids are to be submitted at the same time as unpriced technical offers; if they are, such priced bids shall be submitted in a separate sealed envelope; 
(3)  That it is a multi-step sealed bid procurement, and priced bids will be considered only in the second phase and only from those bidders whose unpriced technical offers are found acceptable in the first phase; 
(4)  The criteria to be used in the evaluation of the unpriced technical offers; 
(5)  That the City, to the extent the procurement officer finds necessary, may conduct oral or written discussions of the unpriced technical offers; 
(6)  That bidders may designate those portions of the unpriced technical offers which contain trade secrets or other proprietary data which are to remain confidential; and 
(7)  That the item being procured shall be furnished in general accordance with the bidder's technical offer as found to be finally acceptable and shall meet the requirements of the invitation for bids. 
(c)  Amendments to the invitation for bids. After receipt of unpriced technical offers, amendments to the invitation for bids shall be distributed only to bidders who submitted unpriced technical offers, and they shall be permitted to submit new unpriced technical offers or to amend those submitted. If, in the opinion of the procurement officer, having obtained the Procurement Administrator's approval, a contemplated amendment will significantly change the nature of the procurement, the invitation for bids shall be cancelled and a new invitation for bids issued. 
(d)  Receipt and handling of unpriced technical offers. Unpriced technical offers shall not be opened publicly but shall be opened in front of two (2) or more procurement officials. Such offers shall not be disclosed to unauthorized persons. Bidders may request non-disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary data identified in writing. 
(e)  Evaluation of unpriced technical offers. The unpriced technical offers submitted by bidders shall be evaluated solely in accordance with the criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. The unpriced technical offers shall be categorized as: 
(1)  Acceptable; 
(2)  Potentially acceptable, that is, reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable; or 
(3)  Unacceptable. The procurement officer shall record in writing the basis for finding an offer unacceptable and make it part of the procurement file. 
(f)  Initiation of phase two. The procurement officer may initiate phase two (2) of the procedure if, in the procurement officer's opinion, there are sufficient acceptable unpriced technical offers to assure effective price competition in the second phase without technical discussions. If the procurement officer finds that such is not the case, the procurement officer shall issue an amendment to the invitation for bids or engage in technical discussions. 
(g)  Discussion of unpriced technical offers. The procurement officer may conduct discussions with any bidder who submits an acceptable or potentially acceptable technical offer. During the course of such discussions the procurement officer or members of the evaluation team shall not disclose any information derived from one (1) unpriced technical offer to any other bidder. Once discussions are begun, any bidder who has not been notified that its offer has been finally found unacceptable may submit supplemental information amending its technical offer at any time until the closing date established by the procurement officer. Such submission may be made at the request of the procurement officer or upon the bidder's own initiative. 
(h)  Notice of unacceptable unpriced technical offer. When the procurement officer determines a bidder's unpriced technical offer to be unacceptable, such offeror shall not be afforded an additional opportunity to supplement its technical offer. 
(i)  Mistakes during multi-step sealed bidding. Mistakes may be corrected or bids may be withdrawn during phase one (1) at any time. During phase two, mistakes may be corrected or withdrawal permitted in accordance with subsection (c) above. 
(j)  Procedure for phase two initiation. Upon the completion of phase one, the procurement officer shall either: 
(1)  Open priced bids submitted in phase one (if priced bids were required to be submitted) from bidders whose unpriced technical offers were found to be acceptable; or 
(2)  If priced bids have not been submitted, technical discussions have been held, or amendments to the invitations for bids have been issued, invite each acceptable bidder to submit a priced bid. 
(k)  Procedure for phase two conduct. Phase two shall be conducted as any other competitive sealed bid procurement except: 
(1)  No public notice need be given of this invitation to submit priced bids because such notice was previously given; 
(2)  After award the unpriced technical offer of the successful bidder shall be disclosed as follows. The procurement officer shall examine written requests of confidentiality for trade secrets and proprietary data in the technical offer of such bidder to determine the validity of any such requests. If the parties do not agree as to the disclosure of data, the procurement officer shall inform the bidder in writing what portions of the unpriced technical offer will be disclosed and that, unless the bidder protests under Section 26A-21, the offer will be so disclosed. Such technical offer shall be open to public inspection subject to any continuing prohibition on the disclosure of confidential data; and 
(3)  Unpriced technical offers of bidders who are not awarded the contract shall not be open to public inspection unless the Procurement Administrator determines in writing that public inspection of such offers is essential to assure confidence in the integrity of the procurement process as provided for within this chapter with respect to the possible disclosure of trade secrets and proprietary data. 
(Ord. No. 97.55, 12-11-97)  
Sec. 26A-8. - Competitive sealed proposals. 
(a)  Conditions for use . When the procurement officer with the approval of the Procurement Administrator, determines that the use of an invitation for bids is either not practicable or not advantageous to the City, a contract may be entered into by use of a request for proposals. 
(b)  Request for proposals . Request for proposals shall be issued and shall include desired specifications, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. 
(c)  Public notice . Adequate public notice of the request for proposals shall be given in the same manner as provided in Section 26A-6(c). 
(d)  Solicitation amendments . Solicitation amendments shall be handled in the same manner as described in Section 26A-6(d). 
(e)  Receipt of proposals . Proposals shall be opened publicly in the presence of one (1) or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the request for proposals. If the proposals have been filed on-line in an electronic format then the opening will be effective upon the opening date and time specified. The name of each offeror shall be read. All other information contained in the proposals shall be confidential so as to avoid disclosure of contents prejudicial to competing offerors during the negotiation process. Proposals shall be open for public inspection only after contract award. A proposal, modification or withdrawal is late if it is received at the location designated in the request for proposal after the time and date set for proposal opening. A late proposal, late modification or late withdrawal shall be rejected, unless the proposal, modification or withdrawal would have been timely received but for the action or inaction of procurement personnel and is received before contract award. Prior to the scheduled opening, the Procurement Department may open an offer to identify the offeror. If this occurs, the staff member shall record the reason for opening the offer, the date and time the offer was opened, and the solicitation number. The offer shall be secured and retained for public opening. 
(f)  Correction and withdrawal of proposals prior to award . Correction and withdrawal of proposals prior to award shall be handled in the same manner as provided in Section 26A-6(g). 
(g)  Mistakes discovered after award . Mistakes discovered after award shall be handled in the same manner as provided in Sections 26A-6(i), (j) and (k).

(i)  Extension of the offer and acceptance period . Extension of the offer and acceptance period shall be handled in the same manner as described in Section 26A-6(l). 
(j)  Clarifications of offers . The purpose for clarifications is to provide for a greater mutual understanding of the offer. Clarifications are not negotiations and material changes to the request for proposal or offer shall not be made by clarification. The procurement officer may request clarifications from any offeror(s) at any time after receipt of offers. Clarifications may be requested orally or in writing. If clarifications are requested orally, the offeror shall confirm the request in writing. A request for clarifications shall not be considered a determination that the offeror is susceptible for award. Any clarifications shall be retained in the procurement file. 
(k)  Determination of not susceptible for award. A procurement officer may determine at any time during the evaluation period and before award that an offer is not susceptible for award. The procurement officer shall notify the offeror in writing of the final determination that the offer is not susceptible for award unless the purchasing officer determines that notification to the offeror would compromise the City's ability to negotiate with other offerors. A determination of non-susceptibility shall be based on the following (but not limited to): 
(1)  A legal offer has not been submitted due to the lack of an authorized signature (or other legal commitment to be bound) on the designated offer form; or 
(2)  An offer is substantially lacking in required information that was to be submitted by the offeror at the time of proposal submittal that significantly impacts the ability of the Evaluation Committee to properly assess scoring; or 
(3)  The offer is not within the competitive range in comparison to other offers based on the scoring of evaluation criteria as set forth in the solicitation. 
(l)  Negotiations with responsible offerors . If negotiations are conducted, negotiations shall be conducted with all offerors determined to be reasonably susceptible for award. Negotiations may be conducted orally or in writing. If oral negotiations are conducted, the offeror shall confirm the negotiations in writing. Offerors may revise offers based on negotiations provided that any revision is confirmed in writing. The City may conduct negotiations with responsible offerors to improve offers in such areas as cost, price, specifications, performance or terms, to achieve best value for the City based on the requirements and the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation. Once negotiations are initiated, an offeror may withdraw an offer at any time before the best and final offer due date and time by submitting a written request to the procurement officer. The procurement officer shall ensure there is no disclosure of one (1) offeror's price or any information derived from competing offers to another offeror. 
(m)  Best and final offers. The procurement officer shall request written best and final offers from any offeror with whom negotiations have been conducted. Best and final offers shall be requested only once, unless the City Procurement Administrator determines that it is advantageous to the City to conduct further negotiations or change the City's requirements. The procurement officer shall include in the written request: 
(1)  The date, time and place for submission of best and final offers; and 
(2)  A statement that if offerors do not submit a written notice of withdrawal or a written best and final offer, their last offer shall be accepted as their best and final offer. 
(n)  Contract award . Award shall be made in accordance with Section 26A-5 on the recommendation of the Procurement Administrator to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the City, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made. After contract award, the proposals shall be open for public inspection except to the extent that the withholding of information is permitted or required by law. If the offeror designates a portion of its proposal as confidential, it shall isolate and identify in writing the confidential portions, but the City remains subject to the Arizona public records law. A brief summary of the proposal being recommended for award and competing proposals along with cursory scoring information will be included in the request for council action and published to the City's external web site up to five (5) days prior to the City council meeting. All other proposals including evaluation information shall remain confidential until after award.

Sec. 26A-9. - Contracting for professional services. 
(a)  A contract for professional services may be awarded by means of competitive sealed proposals, by an invitation for bids or by limited source selection if the director of the using department determines in writing that the nature of the service presents such limited competition that a competitive process cannot reasonably be used or, if used, will result in a substantially higher cost to the City, will otherwise impair the City's financial interests or will substantially impede the City's administrative functions or the delivery of services to the public; or if only one (1) provider has the experience and capability to successfully perform the contract. The director of the department shall be responsible for making a limited source determination, prepare and sign a written limited source justification for not seeking competition and transmit the justification to the Procurement Office for review. 
(b)  Unless the director of the department makes a limited source determination that is approved by the procurement officer and Procurement Administrator, the Procurement Office shall issue competitive solicitations for the requested professional services.

Reverse auction bidding may be used for any of the solicitation processes described within the procurement article including request for quotations, invitation for bids, and request for proposals. 
(b)  Public notice . The Procurement Office shall select a solicitation process and follow the procedures provided for in this chapter. Any public notice of a solicitation process utilizing the reverse auction option will clearly indicate that pricing will be established separately via an independent bidding event.

The reverse auction bidding event will be conducted by the City or via a qualified reverse auction contractor. Once the reverse auction bidding event is completed, the City will finalize the evaluation process by determining the lowest responsive and responsible bidder; or 
(2)  When using a request for proposal process, the submitted offers will be evaluated and scored in accordance with published evaluation criteria with the exception of cost.

The City will have the option of entering into discussions with those firms determined susceptible for award. Interviews may be conducted as well to ensure full understanding of offers. Best and final offers may also be requested as outlined in this chapter. Award will be made to the most advantageous offer in accordance with the scoring of published evaluation criteria.

Sec. 26A-16. - Responsibility of bidders and offerors. 
(a)  Determination of non-responsibility . If a bidder or offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found non-responsible, a written determination of non-responsibility, setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared by the procurement officer.

The final determination shall be made part of the contract file. 
(b)  Factors used to demonstrate bidder or offeror responsibleness . For a bidder or offeror to be considered responsible, the bidder or offeror shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City, its capability to perform an awarded contract in a satisfactory and timely manner, based on requirements stated in the City's bid solicitation which may include but not be limited to whether the proposed bidder or offeror:

In determining the amount and type of security required for each contract, the procurement officer shall consider the nature of the performance and the need for future protection to the City. The requirement for security must be included in the invitation for bids or request for proposals. Failure to timely submit security in the amount and type of security required may result in the rejection of the bid or proposal.

(2)  A statement indicating the City's intent to consider alternative products or materials which have the described essential characteristics if such alternative products or materials are identified.

Such records shall be available for inspection by the Municipal Utilities Director upon request. 
(d)  The method for determining the size of traps or interceptors is the drainage fixture unit value. The minimum size for all interceptors is a capacity of five hundred (500) gallons and the maximum size for all interceptors is a capacity of twenty-five hundred (2,500) gallons. Interceptors must be constructed with at least two (2) chambers. Sizing for all traps is a minimum of a fifty (50) gallon per minute, one hundred (100) pound capacity with the flow control valve installed in a manner that provides access at all times. The appropriate size for interceptors and traps is determined as follows: 
(1)  Interceptor Sizing. The interceptor shall be sized using the drainage fixture-unit value as defined in the following table. Using the drain outlet or trap size, these sizes are converted to discharge rates on the basis that one fixture-unit equals 7.5 gpm. 
Fixture Outlet or 
Trap Size (Inches) 	Drainage 
Fixture-Unit Value 	Gpm Equivalent 
1 ¼ 	1 	7.5 
1 ½ 	2 	15.0 
2 	3 	22.0 
2 ½ 	4 	30.0 
3 	5 	37.5 
4 	6 	45.0 
Floor Drains 
(All Sizes) 	2 	15.0 
Dishwashers 	Double Size 	
 
(2)  Calculating Interceptor Size. The formula to calculate the size of the interceptor is: 
a.  Determine total fixture-unit value by multiplying fixture type count by drainage value; 
b.  Total all values; 
c.  Determine total flow by multiplying total value by flow rate of 3 gpm; 
d.  Multiply total flow by 12; and 
e.  Round up to the next nearest size interceptor. 
(3)  Requirements for Interceptors. The interceptor shall be: 
a.  A minimum of five hundred (500) gallon capacity, two (2) chamber concrete container (fiber glass and/or other type material must be approved by the Municipal Utilities Director); 
b.  When calculated to have a capacity of seven hundred fifty (750) gallons or more, the interceptor must have three (3) chambers, each with a manway; 
c.  Constructed with inlet piping with a ninety degree (90°) elbow and minimum of an eighteen (18) inch down spout; 
d.  Constructed with outlet piping with a tee connection and a threaded cover with a minimum of an eighteen (18) inch down spout; 
e.  Installed with a two (2) way clean-out within five (5) feet before and five (5) feet after the interceptor; and 
f.  Constructed with the appropriate traffic rated cover. The cover(s) must not be marked with any wording indicating it is owned by the City of Tempe. 
(4)  Grease Trap Installation and Sizing. Grease traps are allowed only when there are four (4) or fewer than four (4) fixtures used for food preparation. Any facility installing a dishwasher shall install a grease interceptor. For the purpose of sizing a grease trap, a fixture means the entire unit, e.g., a three (3) compartment sink is considered one unit. Grease traps must be installed as follows: 
a.  A grease trap shall be installed whenever a three (3) compartment sink is required by Maricopa County; 
b.  The minimum size grease trap to be installed shall be rated no smaller than fifty (50) gallon-per-minute with a one hundred (100) pound grease capacity; and 
c.  A flow restriction valve shall be installed upstream of the grease trap and vented properly. If placed below floor level the flow restriction valve must be installed in a manner which allows for inspection and maintenance. 
(e)  Except for domestic sources, users shall not install or replace equipment designed to convert garbage or solid waste into liquefied waste and introduce such waste into the POTW by means of a garbage grinder/disposal. Disposal of garbage and solid waste shall be disposed of as solid waste.

Sec. 27-59. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section 27-55 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Sections 27-51, 27-53 and 27-54 of this article. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph A, above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges additional amounts of such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Municipal Utilities Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

DIVISION 9. - PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE 
 
Sec. 27-82. - Publication of users. 
The Municipal Utilities Director shall publish at least annually, in a newspaper of general circulation to provide public notice within the area served by the POTW, a list of industrial users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Significant noncompliance is determined at the beginning of each quarter based on data of the previous six (6) months. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all wastewater measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period exceed a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1); 
(2)  Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum, long term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the Municipal Utilities Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare of the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Municipal Utilities Director's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days after the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including but not limited to baseline monitoring reports, ninety (90) day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or

When the Municipal Utilities Director finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other applicable federal, state or local pretreatment standard or requirement, the Municipal Utilities Director may serve upon that person a written Notice of Violation. The Municipal Utilities Director in the notice will require the person within ten (10) working days of the receipt of this notice, to provide in writing to the Municipal Utilities Director an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific actions to be taken by the person in violation to prevent subsequent violations. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the person of liability for any violations in the notice or that occurred before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation nor limits the Municipal Utilities Director's authority to take further enforcement actions. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Municipal Utilities Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. In appropriate situations the Municipal Utilities Director may notify the person orally either in person or by telephone prior to, and in some cases in lieu of, written notification. 
(Ord. No. 93.40, 11-18-93; Ord. No. 2001.17, 7-26-01; Ord. No. 2010.02, 2-4-10; Ord. No. O2019.03 , § 11, 2-28-19)  
Sec. 27-87. - Consent orders. 
The Municipal Utilities Director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, negotiated settlement agreements or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 27-89 and 27-90 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.

Notice shall be served on the person specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the person show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the person. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person.

When the Municipal Utilities Director finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other applicable federal, state or local pretreatment standard or requirement, the Municipal Utilities Director may issue an order to the person responsible for the discharge directing that the person come into compliance within a specified time. If the person does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer and/or water service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the person of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person.

Sec. 27-91. - Administrative fines. 
(a)  When the Municipal Utilities Director finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Municipal Utilities Director may fine such person in an amount determined pursuant to the city enforcement response plan and penalty policy adopted pursuant to Section 27-95. For continuing violations, each day may constitute a violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. The Municipal Utilities Director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(b)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent (1%) per month or part thereof until paid in full. A lien against the person's property may be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(c)  Persons desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Municipal Utilities Director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within fifteen (15) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Municipal Utilities Director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the person's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the person. 
(d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person.

Sec. 27-92. - Emergency suspensions. 
The Municipal Utilities Director may immediately suspend a person's discharge, after informal notice to the person, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or imminent threat of substantial damage to the POTW. The Municipal Utilities Director may also immediately suspend a person's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any person notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a person's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Municipal Utilities Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Municipal Utilities Director may allow the person to recommence its discharge when the person has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Municipal Utilities Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 27-93 of this article are initiated against the person. 
(2)  A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement within ten (10) working days, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Municipal Utilities Director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 27-88 or 27-93 of this article. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. For the purposes of this section, informal notice may mean either oral or written notice and does not mean actual notice.

DIVISION 13. - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 
 
Sec. 27-121. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection(c), below, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the Municipal Utilities Director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 93.40, 11-18-93; Ord. No. 2001.17, 7-26-01; Ord. No. 2010.02, 2-4-10; Ord. No. O2019.03 , § 11, 2-28-19)  
Sec. 27-122. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 27-10(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in Sections 27-10(b)(3) through 27-10(b)(14) but excluding 27-10 (b)(8) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 93.40, 11-18-93)  
Sec. 27-123. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, 
(1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Municipal Utilities Director, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the Municipal Utilities Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Municipal Utilities Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the Municipal Utilities Director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The Municipal Utilities Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Municipal Utilities Director determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

Sec. 27-195. - Lien. 
(a)  Unless otherwise prohibited by state law, delinquent sewer service rental shall constitute a lien against the property where the services were provided. The procedure to perfect such lien shall be as follows: 
(1)  The Internal Services Director shall give written notice to the owner of the property within thirty (30) days after the statement is rendered by either personally serving or mailing to such owner at the owner's last-known address by certified or registered mail, or the address to which the sewer service rental billing was sent. This written notice shall indicate that the City shall impress and secure a lien on the subject property unless the owner brings the delinquent bill current within thirty (30) days from service or receipt of the letter, and, in addition, pays any penalties that may be due pursuant to Section 27-192. The notice shall also contain a statement that the owner may appeal the delinquency to the City Council by filing such appeal within the thirty (30) day time period after receipt of such notice. 
(2)  If the owner of the property does not bring the delinquency current or successfully prosecute an appeal to the City Council within the thirty (30) days from service or receipt of the registered or certified letter, the Internal Services Director shall prepare duplicate copies of a notice and claim of lien and file one (1) copy with the county recorder, and within a reasonable time thereafter serve or mail by registered or certified mail the remaining copy to the owner of the property. The notice and claim of lien shall be made under oath by the Internal Services Director or his duly authorized representative and shall contain the following: 
a.  A description of the property sufficient for its identification; 
b.  The name of the owner of the property; and 
c.  The amount of the delinquent bill. 
(3)  From and after the date of its recording in the office of the County Recorder, the lien shall attach to the property until paid. A sale of the property to satisfy the lien shall be made upon judgment of foreclosure and order of sale. The City shall have the right to bring an action to enforce the lien in the county superior court at any time after its recording, but failure to enforce the lien by such action shall not affect its validity. The recorded notice and claim of lien shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all matter recited therein and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the recording therein. 
(b)  A prior recording for the purposes provided in this section shall not be a bar to a subsequent recording of a lien for such purposes, and any number of liens on the same lot or tract of land may be enforced in the same action. 
(Code 1967, § 28-19, 27-45; Ord. No. 93.40, 11-18-93; Ord. No. 2001.17, 7-26-01; Ord. No. 2010.02, 2-4-10; Ord. No. O2014.11, 3-20-14; Ord. No. O2016.22, 4-14-16)  
Sec. 27-196. - Sewer charges. 
(a)  It is hereby determined necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare and to conform with federal, state and local laws and regulations that a system of charges for sanitary sewer system use be established which allocates the cost to each user in such a manner that the allocated costs are proportionate to the cost of providing sanitary sewer system service to that user insofar as those costs can reasonably be determined. A proportionate charge shall be made to all users that discharge wastewater, either directly or indirectly, into the city sanitary sewer system. Such charges shall be based on the rates established pursuant to this article. In addition, each user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the sanitary sewer system shall pay for such increased costs. 
(b)  There are hereby established the following charges, which are in addition to any other charges set by City Code, for sanitary sewer system use: 
(1)  Sewer charge which for the purposes of this division shall mean a charge for the recovery of sanitary sewer system operating and maintenance (O&M) costs, treatment costs and monitoring and testing costs; and 
(2)  Sewer service charge which for the purposes of this division shall mean a charge for the recovery of the costs of capital improvement and replacement in the sanitary sewer system. 
(c)  Users shall be assigned by the Municipal Utilities Department to user classifications for billing purposes. A sewer bill may be rendered on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. The bill shall distinguish between the sewer charge and the sewer service charge. 
(d)  A schedule of charges for the sewer charge and the sewer service charge shall establish separate charges for each user classification established by the Municipal Utilities Department as required in subsection (c) of this section. The schedule of charges and user classifications may provide for a customized industrial user classification in which charges would reflect variations in discharge quality and quantity which may be adjusted monthly. Charges shall be designed to recover the cost of rendering sanitary sewer services for the year during which the charges shall be in effect. Charges shall be established maintaining adequate fund reserves to provide for reasonably expected variations in the cost of providing services, as well as variations in the demand for service. 
(e)  The Internal Services Department shall annually review the sewer charge and the sewer service charge to determine whether any adjustments are necessary to properly recover the cost of providing sanitary sewer system services to each user. If any adjustments are necessary, the Internal Services Department shall submit, in a report to the City Council, a recommended schedule of charges for each user classification. The report shall contain data utilized in determining the schedule of charges. The City Council at a regular meeting shall adopt a notice of intention to adjust the charges and set a date for a public hearing on the proposed adjustment not less than thirty (30) days after the adoption of the notice of intention. After the public hearing, the City Council may adopt by resolution the proposed adjustment. If adopted, the adjustment shall become effective thirty (30) days after the adoption of the resolution (see Appendix A). 
(f)  The sewer charge for each user classification will be determined by the following formula. The sewer charge includes two (2) components, a base charge and a rate per 1,000 gallons discharged. [Sewer charge = base charge + rate per 1,000 gallons]. 
(1)  The base charge constitutes all monitoring and testing costs, allocated only between industrial and commercial users. 
(2)  The rate per 1,000 gallons discharged shall include the following components: 
a.  Operating and maintenance (O&M) costs, allocated by flow between all users: [user flow contribution × $/1,000 gallons]. 
b.  Treatment costs allocated by flow between all users: 
i.  [User flow contribution × $/1,000 gallons]. 
ii.  [User biological oxygen demand (BOD) loading × $/1,000 gallons]. 
iii.  [User suspended solids (SS) loading × $/1,000 gallons]. 
(g)  The sewer service charge for each user classification will be determined by the following formula: capital improvement and replacement costs allocated by flow between all users. [User flow contribution × $/1,000 gallons]. 
(h)  Each user annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, will be given a summary of the sanitary sewer system charges and the basis for those charges. 
(i)  The charge system as set forth in this article for use of the sanitary sewer system shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of agreements or contracts between the City users which are inconsistent with the requirements of Public Law 95-217 and federal regulations issued pursuant thereto. 
(j)  Unless otherwise prohibited by state law, each sewer charge rendered under or pursuant to this article is hereby made a lien upon the corresponding lot, parcel of land, building or premises served by a connection to the sanitary sewer system of the City. 
(k)  The funds received from the collection of the sewer charge and sewer service charge shall be deposited daily by the Internal Services Department into accounts within the water/ wastewater enterprise fund for the purpose of paying the costs of the sanitary sewer system including operation, maintenance, treatment, monitoring/testing and capital improvement and replacement. 
(l)  Wastewater quantity shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  For industrial users with installed water meters, the charges established in this section shall become effective from and after each user's first regular meter reading after the issuance of the industrial waste permit. 
(2)  Any user who fails or refuses to install a water meter to any source of water supply used, within thirty (30) days after written notice by the Municipal Utilities Director to do so, shall be charged on water usage estimated by the Municipal Utilities Director. 
(3)  If a user discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, and it can be shown by such party to the satisfaction of the Municipal Utilities Director that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewer system, then the Municipal Utilities Director may determine in such manner and by such method as he may find practical the percentage of metered water entering the sanitary sewer system. The quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge shall be that percentage, so determined, of the water measured by the water meter or meters; or the Municipal Utilities Director may require or permit the installation of acceptable additional water or sewer meters at such party's expense and in such a manner as to determine the quantity of water actually entering the sanitary sewer system as so determined. If such additional water or sewer meters are installed, an additional charge may be made to cover the cost of reading and computing the flow of each such meter and such additional charge shall be added to each sewer charge bill rendered. 
(4)  After the installation of the measuring equipment is approved by the Municipal Utilities Director, it shall be the obligation of such industrial user to conduct a test on such measuring equipment at least once every twelve (12) months to determine its accuracy and the results thereof shall be furnished in writing to the Municipal Utilities Director. Those users seeking renewal of an industrial wastewater discharge permit or an interim industrial wastewater discharge permit shall file the results as part of the report required by Section 27-35 or Section 27-51, or both, of this chapter. It shall also be the industrial user's responsibility to notify the Municipal Utilities Department within a reasonable time in advance so that the department may, if it chooses, have a witness present during such test. If upon any such test the percentage of accuracy is found to be within the accuracy tolerance as established by the manufacturer's specifications, such measuring equipment shall be determined to have correctly measured the quantity delivered to the sanitary sewer system. If, however, upon any such test the percentage of accuracy is found to be in excess of the accuracy tolerance specified by the manufacturer's specifications, then such measuring equipment shall be immediately adjusted to register correctly the quantity delivered to the sanitary sewer system. The billings to such industrial user shall be adjusted for a period extending back to the time when the inaccuracy began, if such time is ascertainable, or for a period extending back one-half (½) of the time elapsed since the date of the last test or the date of the last adjustment, if the time is not ascertainable. 
(5)  All users for which the water supply is from other suppliers of water shall furnish to the City either a certified meter reading of water delivered to its plant or company, or a copy of the billing from the water supplier. In this event, the user's charges will be calculated and the same conditions will apply as if the City were the supplier of water to the user. 
(6)  For residential and commercial users with installed water meters, the charges established in this section shall become effective from and after each user's first regular meter reading. 
(m)  Wastewater quality shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  Testing by direct sampling, utilizing recognized field techniques, equipment and procedures, will be used for all industrial users permitted in Article I. The BOD (5) tests shall be considered the standard test, however, COD or TOC tests may be substituted in cases where it has been determined by the Municipal Utilities Director that the BOD (5) test is not representative of actual wastewater loading. Waste water characteristics shall be determined by the Municipal Utilities Department on the basis of monitored wastewater discharged, a certified statement from the user, or on the best available data as to the characteristics of such discharges. 
(2)  Any change in the ongoing process(es) employed by a user contributing industrial waste which results in a variation of more than twenty-five percent (25%) in one (1) or more of the effluent loading concentrations shall be reported to the Municipal Utilities Department within thirty (30) days of such change. 
(3)  If it is determined through testing that a variation exists between the user's certified data and the discharge characteristics monitored by the Municipal Utilities Department, the City may adjust the sewer charge based on the monitored data from the original date of certification, unless written communication has occurred notifying the department of changes in loading and giving specific dates of changes. 
(4)  Designated discharge. Where sampling and gauging of a specific user is not practical for physical, economic, safety or other reasons, the Municipal Utilities Director may designate values for concentrations of the wastes discharged into the sanitary sewer system for all users in the same standard industrial classification or subclassification.

Sec. 27-197. - Reimbursement for remediation. 
(a)  When it is necessary to remediate a private sanitary sewer spill, release of industrial waste, or chemical release that has entered the city's right-of-way, has the potential to enter the public right-of-way, or poses a threat to public health, safety and welfare, the property owner or responsible party using the property will be issued a written notice ordering the remediation of the area of concern. 
(b)  The property owner or responsible party using the property shall commence the remediation within one (1) hour of receiving the written notice ordering remediation. Failure to follow the order to remediate within the specified time shall be cause for the City to remediate the city's right-of-way and any area that poses a threat to public health, safety and welfare. 
(c)  The property owner or responsible party using the property shall be charged for time and materials necessary to remediate the property to the extent necessary to eliminate the threat to public health, safety, and welfare and an administrative fee of five percent (5%) of the total remediation costs. 
(d)  Failure to comply with the written order to remediate or failure to reimburse the City for the costs of remediation and pay the administrative fee shall be cause for termination of water and sewer services to the property.

Chapter 31A - TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS  
ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND DEFINITIONS 
 
Sec. 31A-1. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  The purpose of this chapter is to establish a policy governing the management of public highways for the provision of telecommunications services to enable the City to: 
(1)  Issue licenses and franchises to telecommunications corporations who use the public highways to provide telecommunications services on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, except in cases where state law forbids establishment of a license or franchise requirement; 
(2)  Manage the public highways in order to minimize the impact and cost to Tempe citizens of the placement of telecommunications facilities within public highways; 
(3)  Manage the public highways so as to maximize their efficient use, thereby minimizing the foreclosure of future additional uses of such rights-of-way; and 
(4)  Minimize congestion, inconvenience, visual impact, and other adverse effects on the city's public highways. 
(b)  Therefore, in this chapter the City Council intends: 
(1)  To ensure that locally elected officials manage local public highways consistent with their fiduciary trust obligations; 
(2)  To ensure compliance with public health, safety and welfare measures for public highways; 
(3)  To encourage public-private partnerships to provide telecommunications facilities needed for the most cost-effective delivery of public services, including schools, libraries, police and fire protection, as well as private services; 
(4)  To conserve the limited physical capacity of the public highways held in public trust by the City; and 
(5)  To assure that the city's current and ongoing costs of granting and regulating private access to and use of the public highways are fully paid by the persons seeking such access and causing such costs.

ARTICLE II. - LICENSE OR FRANCHISE TO OCCUPY RIGHTS-OF-WAY 
 
Sec. 31A-10. - License or franchise required. 
(a)  No telecommunications corporation shall install, maintain, construct or operate telecommunications facilities in any public highway in the City unless a license to use the highways to provide telecommunications services has first been granted by the City Council under this chapter or a franchise awarded by the electorate under Article XIII of the Arizona Constitution and this chapter to such telecommunications corporation. 
(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), any telecommunications corporation that was providing telecommunications service within the State of Arizona as of October 31, 1997, pursuant to a grant made to it or its lawful predecessors prior to the effective date of the Arizona Constitution, may continue to provide telecommunications services pursuant to that state grant, until and unless the state grant is lawfully repealed, revoked or amended, and need not obtain any further authorization from the City to provide telecommunication services; provided, however, that such entity must in all other respects comply with the requirements applicable to telecommunications corporations, as provided in Title 9, Chapter 5, Article 7, Arizona Revised Statutes. 
(c)  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to affect the terms or conditions of any franchise, license or permit issued by the City prior to the effective date of the amendments to this chapter, or to release any party from its obligations thereunder. Those franchises, licenses or permits shall remain fully enforceable in accordance with their terms. The City Manager, with the consent of the City Council, may enter into agreements with franchise holders, licensees or permittees to modify or terminate an existing franchise, license or agreement. 
(d)  A license or franchise to any telecommunications corporation to use the highways to install, maintain, construct or operate telecommunications facilities under this chapter shall not authorize the use of the highways to provide any other service; nor shall the issuance of the same invalidate any franchise, license or permit that authorizes the use of the highways for such other service; nor shall the fact that an entity holds a franchise, license or permit to make any other use of the highway or to provide any other service authorize installation, maintenance, construction or operation of telecommunications facilities in any highway in the City without obtaining a license or franchise hereunder. 
(e)  Any license or franchise granted shall not be exclusive. 
(f)  A telecommunications licensee may enter into contracts for use of its facilities within the public highways to provide telecommunication services. Persons using such licensee's facilities must themselves obtain a telecommunication license if such person constructs, installs, operates or maintains telecommunication facilities within the public highway of the City. If the persons using such licensee's facilities do not construct, install, operate or maintain telecommunication facilities within the public highway of the City, such persons need not obtain a separate license but the telecommunications licensee must disclose the identity of such persons to the City.

The amount of the fee shall be reasonably related to the cost directly incurred by the City to process the application and can be appealed to the City Council. 
(b)  Each application shall, at a minimum, include the following information: 
(1)  Show where the facilities the applicant will use will be located, or contain such other information as the City may deem necessary in order to ensure that the applicant will comply with requirements for use of the highways; 
(2)  Identify the applicant, its name, address and telephone number; 
(3)  Contain a description of the services to be provided; and 
(4)  Set out a description of any agreement with any other entity that would permit such entity to use the facilities. 
(c)  Upon receiving an application for a franchise or license that satisfies the conditions of subsection (b), the City shall promptly proffer a telecommunications franchise or license to the applicant for its review, and may inquire into matters relevant to the issuance of the license or franchise. If the applicant agrees to the terms and conditions of the franchise or license, and otherwise satisfies the conditions set forth herein, the request shall be submitted to City Council with a recommendation for approval (in the case of a license) or scheduled for a franchise election (in the case of an application for a franchise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City need not issue or renew a license, or schedule a franchise election if the applicant has previously had its telecommunications services license or franchise revoked, or for any other reason permitted under Arizona law.

Sec. 31A-12. - License terms. 
(a)  Length of license. Any license granted by the City pursuant to this chapter shall commence upon adoption of the license and acceptance of the license by the provider. The license shall be effective for a period determined by the City Council, but not to exceed five (5) years, and subject to the conditions and restrictions provided in the instrument and this chapter. 
(b)  License or franchise agreement. As a condition of issuing or renewing a license or franchise to use the public highways to construct, install, operate and maintain telecommunication facilities, the City may require the applicant to: 
(1)  Show proof of receipt of a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Arizona Corporation Commission; 
(2)  Agree to comply with highway use requirements that the City may establish from time to time; 
(3)  Agree to provide and maintain accurate maps showing the location of all the facilities it will use in the highways within the City, and to comply with such other mapping requirements as the City may establish from time to time; 
(4)  Obtain the insurance, and provide proof of insurance as required by the City; post the performance bonds and security fund required by the City; and agree to fully indemnify the City, its officers, agents, boards and commissions, in a form satisfactory to the City; and agree that it shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City or its officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees for any loss, costs, expense or damages arising out of any provision or requirement of expense or damages arising out of any provision or requirement of the City because of the enforcement of the license or franchise or because of defects in this chapter or the license or franchise issued; 
(5)  Agree to comply with and be bound by the administrative and enforcement provisions as may be prescribed from time to time by the City. Every franchise or license shall be subject to the following administrative and enforcement provisions: 
a.  Franchises and licenses shall be personal to the franchisee or licensee. Except as provided in the license or franchise, no transfer of a franchise, franchisee, licensor or licensee, or change of control over the same (including, but not limited to, transfer by forced or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership, or any other means) shall occur unless prior application is made to the City and the city's prior written consent is obtained, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In making a determination as to whether to approve a transfer, the City may consider the same information and qualifications required of an original application for a license or franchise; whether the licensee or franchisee is in compliance with its license or franchise and this chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; whether the transfer would result in an evasion of other applicable provisions of law, or impair lawful contracts; and the effect of the transfer on the city's interests. No application for a transfer of a license or franchise shall be granted unless the proposed transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and the license or franchise, and that it will assume all obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions, known and unknown, of the previous licensee or franchisee under this chapter and the license or franchise for all purposes, including renewal. Approval by the City of a transfer of a license or franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the City under this chapter or the franchise or license, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer; 
b.  Every franchisee or licensee shall be subject to the city's exercise or such police, regulatory and other powers as it now has or may later obtain, and a franchise or license may not waive the application of the same; 
c.  Penalties for violation of franchise or license; 
d.  Damages for violation of the franchise or license terms. Any remedies available to the City are cumulative, and are not limited by the recovery of any amounts pursuant to the insurance provisions of the license or franchise, or pursuant to any indemnity clause; 
e.  A requirement that if the franchisee or licensee fails to pay amounts owed to the City by the time prescribed for payment, the franchisee or licensee shall pay interest on the amounts owed, at the rate of one percent (1%) per month; and 
f.  A requirement that franchisee or licensee shall produce books and records for the city's inspection and copying, prepare reports, respond to questions and permit the City to have access to its facilities as the City may request in order to determine whether licensee or franchisee has complied with its obligations under the franchise or license, or other applicable law; and 
(6)  A licensee that receives a telecommunications service license pursuant to this chapter may apply for a renewal of its license, which renewal shall be reviewed in accordance with the requirement of state law. 
(c)  No warranty. The issuance of a license, permit or other authorization by the City is not a representation or warranty that such license, permit, or authorization is a legally sufficient substitute for a franchise, and is not a representation of warranty that a franchise is not required.

Said license shall provide for quarterly payments to the City of a right-of-way occupancy fee for each lineal foot of installation on the bases of fair market value and cost, as determined by the City Council at the time of the granting of the license and adjusted periodically thereafter at the city's discretion. The license may also contain such additional terms and conditions as the City Council may approve consistent with the purposes and findings in this chapter and applicable law; 
(2)  Transitting traffic license. The City Council may issue a limited license to authorize use of the city's rights-of-way solely for the purpose of providing telecommunications service where no sale or exchange of service originates or terminates in the City.

(Ord. No. 97.69, 12-11-97)  
Sec. 31A-31. - Location and relocation of facilities in rights-of-way. 
(a)  Each provider is responsible for ensuring that its facilities are installed, constructed and maintained in strict accordance with the City Code; that all required licenses, franchises and permits are applied for and obtained before any work commences; and that the terms and conditions thereof are strictly followed. Where a facility has more than one (1) provider, each provider is fully responsible for ensuring that all requirements are satisfied. Facilities shall be installed, constructed and maintained so that no additional costs are imposed upon the City, and so that the facility does not interfere with other uses or users of the public rights-of-way. Without limiting the requirement of any other provision of the City Code, or the provisions of any license, permit or franchise issued by the City, this shall require, at a minimum, compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  The facilities to be constructed, installed, operated and maintained by the provider shall be so located or relocated as to interfere as little as possible with traffic or other authorized uses over, under or through the rights-of-way. Those phases of construction relating to traffic control, backfilling, compaction and paving, as well as the location or relocation of said facilities shall be subject to regulation by the City Council. 
(c)  The provider shall keep accurate installation records of the location of all facilities in the rights-of-way and furnish them to the City upon request or at such periodic intervals as the City may require. Upon completion of new or relocation construction of underground facilities in the rights-of-way, the provider shall provide the City, if requested or as required, with installation records in a format compatible with the then-current city mapping format showing the location of the underground and above ground facilities. 
(d)  Whenever the provider shall cause any opening or alteration whatever to be made for any purpose in any rights-of-way, the work shall be completed within the time specified in the license, permit or franchise, or if no time is specified then within a reasonable time. In addition, the provider shall, without expense to the City and upon the completion of such work, restore the property disturbed in a manner consistent with the city's duly adopted standards, or as required by its permits, licenses or franchises. 
(e)  The installation, use and maintenance of the provider's facilities within the rights-of-way authorized herein shall be in such a manner as not to interfere with the city's placement, construction, use and maintenance of its rights-of-way, street lighting, water pipes, drains, sewers, traffic signal systems or other city systems that have been, or may be, installed, maintained, used or authorized by the City. Upon the city's request, provider's facilities will be relocated at provider's expense, unless state law expressly requires otherwise. Upon the city's request, by a time specified by the City, if the provider fails to move its facilities, the City may do so and will bill the provider the costs therefor and the provider shall pay those costs within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the invoice therefor. Further, the provider shall reimburse the City any additional cost the City incurs due to the location or relocation of the provider's facilities, including all design and construction costs. 
(f)  The provider shall not install, maintain or use any of its facilities in such a manner as to damage or interfere with facilities of another located within the rights-of-way of the City. 
(g)  All facilities shall be installed per plans approved by the City. If the provider makes use of existing conduit of another provider, the provider shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter in the use of such conduit in the rights-of-way. 
(h)  Each provider must obtain and maintain such insurance, bonding and security fund requirements as specified by the City, or if no specific requirements are designated, as are required by the City for similar facilities. No work shall commence unless these requirements have been satisfied, and the City may require the provider to remove or stop work on facilities, or require a provider to cease using the facility, when any insurance, bonding or security fund requirements are not satisfied. 
(i)  A permit shall be obtained from the Engineering and Transportation Department prior to a provider removing, abandoning, relocating or reconstructing, if necessary, any portion of a provider's facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City understands and acknowledges there may be instances when a provider is required to make repairs, in compliance with federal or state laws, that are of an emergency nature. The provider will notify the City prior to such repairs, if practicable, and will obtain the necessary permits in a reasonable time after notification.

(a)  If, during the design process for public improvements, the City discovers a potential conflict with proposed construction, the provider shall either: 
(1)  Locate and, if necessary, expose its facilities in conflict; or 
(2)  Use a location service under contract with the City to locate or expose its facilities. The provider shall reimburse the City for the cost resulting from the use of such location service. 
(b)  The City shall make reasonable efforts to design and construct projects pursuant to this section so as to avoid relocation expense to the provider. Provider shall furnish location information to the City in a timely manner, but in no case longer than fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the city's request. 
(c)  The City reserves the prior and superior right to lay, construct, erect, install, use, operate, repair, replace, remove, relocate, regrade, widen, realign or maintain any rights-of-way, aerial, surface or subsurface improvements, including, but not limited to, water mains, traffic control conduits, cable and devices, sanitary or storm sewers, subways, tunnels, bridges, viaducts or any other public construction within the rights-of-way of the City. 
(d)  When the City invokes its prior superior right to the rights-of-way, the provider shall move its facilities located in the rights-of-way, at its own cost, to such a location as the City directs. 
(e)  If, during the course of a project, the City determines provider's facilities are in conflict, the following shall apply: 
(1)  Prior to city notice to proceed to contractor, the provider shall, within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding one (1) month, remove or relocate the conflicting facility. This time period shall begin running upon receipt by the provider of written notice from the City. However, if both the City and the provider agree, the time frame may be extended based on the requirements of the project; or 
(2)  Subsequent to city notice to proceed to contractor, the City and the provider will immediately begin the coordination necessary to remove or relocate the facility. Actual construction of such removal or relocation is to begin no later than seventy-two (72) hours, if practicable, after written notification from the City of the conflict.

Sec. 31A-33. - Damage to city rights-of-way and facilities. 
(a)  If, in the installation, use, or maintenance of its facilities, the provider damages or disturbs the surface or subsurface of any rights-of-way or adjoining public property, or the public improvement located thereon, therein or thereunder, the provider shall promptly, at its own expense, and in a manner acceptable to the City, restore the surface or subsurface of the rights-of-way or public property, or repair or replace the public improvement thereon, therein or thereunder, in as good a condition as before such damage or disturbance. If such restoration, repair or replacement of the surface, subsurface or any structure located thereon, therein or thereunder is not completed within a reasonable time, or such repair or replacement does not meet duly adopted standards, the City shall have the right to perform the necessary restoration, repair or replacement, either through its own forces, or through a hired contractor, and the provider shall pay the City for its expenses in so doing within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the invoice therefor. 
(b)  The provider shall reimburse the City for all costs arising from the reduction in the service life of any public road or pavement damage, to the extent required by any other city chapters, resulting from pavement cuts of the provider. The provider shall pay such costs within thirty (30) days from the date of issuance of an invoice from the City. 
(Ord. No. 97.69, 12-11-97)  
Sec. 31A-34. - Relocation of facilities. 
(a)  The City shall not bear any cost of relocating existing facilities, irrespective of the function served, where city facilities or other facilities occupying the rights-of-way under authority of a city permit, license or franchise which must be relocated, are already located in the rights-of-way and the conflict between the provider's potential facilities and the existing facilities can only be resolved expeditiously as determined by the City by the movement of the existing city or other approved facilities. 
(b)  If provider's relocation effort so delays construction of a public project causing the City to be liable for delay damages, the provider shall reimburse the City for those damages attributable to the delay created by the provider. If the provider should dispute the amount of damages attributable to the provider, the matter shall be referred to the Dispute Resolution Board. The Dispute Resolution Board shall consist of one (1) member selected by the City, one (1) member selected by the provider, and a third person agreed upon by both parties. The person agreed upon by both parties shall be chairperson of the Dispute Resolution Board. Expenses for the Dispute Resolution Board shall be shared equally by the City and the provider. The board will hear the dispute promptly, and render an opinion as soon as possible, but in no case later than sixty (60) days after notification by the City of provider's allocated share of damages suffered by the City. All decisions of the Dispute Resolution Board are non-binding on either the City or the provider, however, the findings of the Dispute Resolution Board shall be admissible in any legal action. The City and the provider shall accept or reject findings of the Dispute Resolution Board within thirty (30) days after receipt of the findings. If damages are assessed by the Dispute Resolution Board, the provider shall pay the City within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice. Late charges of five percent (5%) and interest charges of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month shall be added for late payment. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided in a license, franchise, or permit, or by other provision of law, the entire cost of relocation shall be borne by the City if the provider is required by the City to relocate facilities which are located in private easements obtained by the provider prior to the dedication of the public street or easement from which the facilities must be relocated. These prior rights of the provider would also be unaffected by any subsequent relocation. A prior rights as used in this subsection, means private easement rights obtained by the provider prior to the dedication of the streets or public ways from which the facilities are requested by the City to be relocated. In the case of a facility that serves multiple purposes, the prior rights must extend to all uses for this exception to apply.

(b)  All consumers, other than property owners as specified in subsection (c), before domestic water shall be furnished to them, shall place a deposit with the Internal Services Director sufficient to ensure the payment of water billed to them and to protect the City against loss occasioned by nonpayment of water bills.

If domestic water service is turned off by the City for any reason and the service so turned off does not have a turn-off valve installed as required above on the property owner's premises for the turning off of such domestic water, such person shall, prior to the City again turning on such service, install in accordance with the provisions above a proper turn-off valve on such premises.

(c)  If the persons listed on the water service account have made a deposit with the City, the balance, if any, of such deposit shall be returned to those persons who paid the deposit, after deducting the amount of any money owed on the water service account to the City. Deposits unclaimed after twenty-four (24) months from the date the deposit became refundable are presumed abandoned.

Sec. 34-1. - Defined. 
An "inspection warrant" is an order, in writing, in the name of the people, signed by a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction, directed to a state, county or local official, commanding him to conduct any inspection required or authorized by state, county or local law or regulation relating to building, fire, safety, plumbing, electrical, health or zoning. 
(Code 1967, § 37-1)  
Sec. 34-2. - Issuance—Supporting affidavit. 
An inspection warrant shall be issued only upon cause, supported by affidavit, particularly describing the place, dwelling, structure, premises or vehicle to be searched and the purpose for which the search is made. In addition, the affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect has been sought and refused or facts or circumstances reasonable justifying the failure to seek such consent. 
(Code 1967, § 37-2)  
Sec. 34-3. - Same—When cause deemed to exist. 
Cause shall be deemed to exist if either reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting a routine or area inspection are satisfied with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises or vehicle, or there is reason to believe that a condition of nonconformity exists with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises or vehicle. 
(Code 1967, § 37-3)  
Sec. 34-4. - Same—Examination of witnesses may be prerequisite. 
Before issuing an inspection warrant, the judge may examine on oath the applicant and any other witnesses, and shall satisfy himself of the existence of grounds for granting such application. 
(Code 1967, § 37-4)  
Sec. 34-5. - Same—By judge; statement of procedure of inspection. 
If the judge is satisfied that cause for the inspection exists, he shall issue the warrant particularly describing each place, dwelling, structure, premises or vehicle to be inspected and designating on the warrant the purpose and limitations of the inspection, including the limitations required by this chapter. 
(Code 1967, § 37-5)  
Sec. 34-6. - Duration of warrant; extension or renewal; execution and return. 
An inspection warrant shall be effective for the time specified therein, but not for a period of more than fourteen (14) days, unless extended or renewed by the judge who signed and issued the original warrant upon satisfying himself that such extension or renewal is in the public interest. Such inspection warrant must be executed and returned to the judge by whom it was issued within the time specified in the warrant or within the extended or renewed time. After the expiration of such time the warrant, unless executed, is void.

Sec. 34-7. - Hours of inspection; forcible entry prohibited; exceptions; notice. 
An inspection pursuant to this warrant may not be made between 6:00 p.m. of any day and 8:00 a.m. of the succeeding day, nor in the absence of an owner or occupant of the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises or vehicle unless specifically authorized by the judge upon a showing that such authority is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the regulation being enforced. An inspection pursuant to a warrant shall not be made by means of forcible entry; except that the judge may expressly authorize a forcible entry where facts are shown sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of violation of a state, county or local law or regulation relating to buildings, fire, safety, plumbing, electrical, health or zoning, which, if such violation existed, would be an immediate threat to health or safety, or where facts are shown establishing that reasonable attempts to serve a previous warrant have been unsuccessful. Where prior consent has been sought and refused, notice to the owner or occupant that a warrant has been issued must be given at least twenty-four (24) hours before the warrant is executed, unless the judge finds that immediate execution is reasonably necessary in the circumstances shown. 
(Code 1967, § 37-7)

density
housing to be combined with commercial,
office
and
public uses
that serve theneighborhood. Residential uses are allowed up to ten (10) units per
acre. Permitted commercial uses are limited to those thatare compatible with low
to medium
density
housing.

recognized as having serious objectionableoperational characteristics, particularly
when several such uses are concentrated under circumstances having a deleterious effectupon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is
necessary to insure that these adverse secondaryeffects will not contribute to the
blighting or downgrading of the existing surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations
areitemized in this section. The purpose of the regulation is to promote the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city bypreventing a concentration
of these uses in any one (1) area. It is not the intent of this Code to restrict or
deny access by adults tosexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment,
or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment
to their intended market. Further, it is not the intent of this Code to permit any
use or act, which is otherwise prohibitedor made punishable by law.

is to create functional, safe,
accessible
and attractive outdoor areas, as well as screen from viewany and all uses that may
be unattractive to public view.
Landscape
design standards are intended to: assist in controlling erosion,reduce dust and glare,
provide shade, visually soften
building
masses, create defensible spaces that support crime prevention, ensureADA
accessibility
and aid in screening intense activities. The design standards and referenced guidelines
in this chapter are intended tobe flexible and adaptable to address the context in
which they are applied.
Applicability.
All uses and
developments
shall conform to the standards of this chapter, except as provided for uses and
developments

spaces and maneuvering areas, shall be
landscaped
. When a
use permit
is granted toexceed the
parking
maximum, per
Section 4-603
, a minimum of twelve percent (12%) of the surface area of all surface parking
lots
, as measured around the perimeter of all
parking
spaces and maneuvering areas, shall be
landscaped
. Such
landscape
treatments shall consist of an evenly distributed mix of shade trees with shrubs and/or
ground cover plants. "Evenlydistributed" means that the trees and other plants are
distributed around the

Option 2: Performance Standard Based on Tree Canopy. The
landscape plan
provides for an overall tree or shade canopyabove surface
parking
areas that is not less than twenty percent (20%) of the
parking
area, based on the expected size of treeswithin five (5) years of planting. When
a
use permit
is granted to exceed the
parking
maximum, per
Section 4-603
, the
landscape plan
provides for an overall tree or shade canopy above surface
parking
areas that is not less than twenty-twopercent (22%) of the
parking
area, based on the expected size of trees within five (5) years of planting. Such
determination shallbe based on landscape or tree planting guides for the region (e.g.,

zoning districts will be reviewed to assure the public that an appropriate transition
isestablished while use of the property as permitted by the Code is still allowed.
Applicability.
The standards of the GIOD shall apply whenever a general industrial zoning district
is adjacent to a single-familyresidential district, or is separated from a single-family
district only by an
alley
, tract, canal or easement (excluding AG, Agriculturaland R1-PAD).
Section 5-302 - Boundaries.
The boundaries of the General Industrial Overlay District are defined as all

A.
Section 5-401 - Purpose.
The purpose of
Planned Area Development Overlay Districts
is to accommodate, encourage and promote innovatively designed
developments
involving residential and/or non-residential land uses, which form an attractive and
harmonious unit of the community.Such a planned
development
may be designed as a large-scale separate entity, able to function as an individual
community,neighborhood, or
mixed-use development
; as a small-scale project which requires flexibility because of unique circumstances
or designcharacteristics; or as a transitional area between dissimilar land uses.
This zoning designation recognizes that adherence to a traditional pattern of
development
standards, (i.e. height,
setback
,
lot coverage
)space, bulk and use specifications contained elsewhere in this Code would preclude
the application of the more flexible PAD concept.Therefore, where PAD zoning is deemed
appropriate or necessary, traditional zoning regulations are replaced by performanceconsiderations to fulfill the objectives of the General Plan. The PAD
overlay district
may be tailored to meet the specific
development
representations of an application. Hence one (1) PAD overlay may vary considerably
from another overlay.
Section 5-402 - Applicability.
The
Planned Area Development Overlay District
may be applied to any zoning district in the City of Tempe. A PAD Overlay District
maynot be used for an individual detached single
family
dwelling
. A
Development Plan Review
application shall be processed concurrentlywith a PAD Overlay District, pursuant
to
Section 6-306
.
(Ord. No. 2014.72, 12-4-2014)
Section 5-403 - General Regulations.
Land Use.
All uses shall comply with underlying zoning district.
Density.
The PAD Overlay District shall not modify densities allowed by the underlying zoning
district.
Development Standards.
The PAD Overlay District may establish alternate
development
standards (except
density
) for thosestandards found in Tables 4-202A, 4-202B, 4-202C, 4-203A, 4-203B,
4-204
,
Section 4-205
, and parking standards found in Table 4-603E.PAD Overlays in the mixed-use zoning
districts that identify a development standard as "NS" (No Standard) found in Table
4-203B, shallestablish such standard. Standards developed through the PAD Overlay
District process shall be appropriate to the location andcontext for the site for
which the project is proposed. Standards created through the PAD Overlay should also
assist in the fulfillmentof the goals, objectives and policies in the General Plan.
Approval of the standards is based on the site plan provided as part of thePAD.
Modifications to PAD Overlay Standards.
Once development standards are established through the PAD Overlay they may beamended
only through the PAD Overlay modification process set forth in
Section 6-312
.

CHAPTER 5 — - HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICTS
Section 5-501 - Purpose.
The purpose of Historic Overlay Districts is to provide protection for significant
properties which represent important aspects ofTempe's heritage, to enhance the character
of the community by taking such properties and sites into account during development,
andto assist owners in the preservation and restoration of their properties.

Historic Property Nomination. Nomination materials, including the application, supporting
information, research materials, andStaff reports and recommendations identify character-defining
features of the district relating to the historic period of significance.Conservation
and enhancement of these character defining features is the basis for historic preservation
review.
Design Guidelines. Subsequent to designation of an historic district, the Historic
Preservation Commission will, in cooperation withrepresentatives from the respective
district, and in order to preserve and enhance the distinctive character of the respectivedistrict, adopt design guidelines which shall apply only to the exterior features
and general character of contributing propertiesand alterations thereto, as well

CHAPTER 6 — - TRANSPORTATION OVERLAY DISTRICT
Section 5-601 - Purpose.
The purpose of the Tempe Transportation Overlay District (TOD) is to encourage appropriate
land development and redevelopment thatis consistent with and complementary to the
community's focused investment in transit, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure in
certaingeographic areas of the City. Tempe is developing a multi-modal transportation
system intended to balance the choices people have tomove throughout the City, meet
the mobility needs of its citizens and mitigate the impacts of congestion and pollution.
This OverlayDistrict regulates land uses and establishes development standards in
order to prevent developments which would interrupt the transit,bicycle and pedestrian
experience.
The specific objectives of this District are to:
Promote and develop livable and sustainable neighborhoods;
Promote and increase the use of alternative modes of transportation such as walking,
bicycling, car pooling, riding the bus or lightrail;
Encourage a mix of uses and balance of densities and intensities within identified
activity areas accessible to alternative modes oftransportation;
Provide a quality of urban design (as defined within the standards) that attracts
and encourages pedestrian activity;
Reinforce public investments and private development to achieve a compact form of
development conducive to walking, bicycling,and transit use; and
Provide facilities that create a safe,
accessible
, comfortable and pleasant environment for people; maintain safe access for

Section 5-612 - Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards.
Purpose.
Since all trips begin and end as pedestrian trips, the quality of the pedestrian environment
and the nature of the pedestrianlinkages between land uses and transportation modes
play a large role in the success of this multi-modal transportation system. thepurpose
of this section is to require a quality of urban design that attracts and encourages
pedestrian activity, creates a safe,accessible, comfortable and pleasant environment
for people and minimizes conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians.
Applicability.
The provisions of this section shall apply to all new development, redevelopment,
and exterior
alterations
to existingdevelopment in all zoning districts within the Transportation Overlay
District.
Exemptions.
The following items are exempt from the requirements of this Section:
Single-Family, Agricultural and Mobile Home Districts, are not part of the Transportation
Overlay District; however,owners/occupants of property within these districts adjacent
to the Transportation Overlay District are encouraged to plant andmaintain trees
within yards and landscape areas adjacent to public sidewalks for the purpose of providing
shade and comfort.Neighborhoods are also encouraged to apply for neighborhood grants
which facilitate pedestrian enhancements within thespecified boundaries of this District;

that is not feasible or prudent, as determined bythe Community Development Director;
or
Industrial Districts, except for standards identified in
Section 5-612
(H), Pedestrian and Transit Patron Amenities.
Maximum and Minimum Building Setbacks.
The purpose of this section is to reduce the distance that pedestrians must walk toaccess buildings by bringing buildings closer to the street edge of the property,
while providing opportunities for pedestrian amenitiesand variation in building façade.
The maximum building setbacks of the Transportation Overlay District (Tables
5-610
, 5-611A, and 5-611B) are applicable to new buildings, as follows:

private property tomeet this intent.
Residential-Facing Façades.
The purpose of this section is to assure that new development retains privacy for
existing residences andconsiders the views of the new development from the residences.
For properties without an alley, adjacent to Single-Family, Multi-Family or Mixed-Use
districts, the site design shall:
Provide landscape buffers and screening to assure the privacy of adjacent residents;
Minimize building heights shade impacts on adjacent solar equipment, gardens or pools;
Design buildings to have similar attention to detail as the street front façade to
provide visual interest in materials and structure toaddress potential views from
residences; and
Screen delivery entrances from residential view.
Minimum Parking Ratios.
The purpose of this section is to provide an optional reduction in parking to developments
within theOverlay District; this may be done at the time of development, or planned
into a future phasing to assure parking availability prior tolight rail construction.
The minimum number of required parking spaces, as provided in
Section 4-603
, is reduced for commercial usesthat meet the criteria in Table 5-612A. The other
methods of parking reduction (shared parking, parking demand model) provided in

Landscape Standards.
All standards and restrictions of Part 4 Chapter 7, Landscape Standards, are applicable,
with the followingadditions and exceptions:
Plant materials within five (5) feet of sidewalks or bike lanes shall not include
any plants with thorns, spines or sharp points;
Trees shall be planted within six (6) feet of sidewalks, or as determined by the Public
Works Department to provide sufficient shadewhen trees have grown to mature form;
and
Mature trees must be trimmed for an eight (8) feet clear vertical height from top
of walkway surface to the bottom of the treecanopy.
Loading, Delivery, and Service Entrances.
Site design must accommodate loading needs while preserving accessibility, mobility
andsafety for all other users.
Provide sufficient space for safe maneuvering and ingress and egress of larger vehicles.
Through-access solutions should beprovided to minimize or eliminate turning within
parking lots and minimize the amount of needed hardscaped area formaneuvering.
Provide signs at entrance and exit points for loading and delivery, and provide audible
signal when vehicle approaches pedestrianpaths where appropriate. Understandable
right-of-way signage shall be provided where truck, auto, pedestrian and bike conflictsmay occur.
Delivery vehicles should access loading from alleys or side streets where possible
to minimize conflicts along heavy traffic areas.
Deliveries during daylight off-peak traffic hours are preferred (when noise is not
in conflict with residential uses).
Open Space.
Station areas
shall include public open space as defined and determined within Station Area Plans.
Within the
corridor
,public plazas, pocket parks, roof top gardens, courtyards and other forms of open
space are encouraged. Retention areas may beused for park and recreation amenities
as long as the primary use for storm water retention is still met. Pedestrian connections
andcorridors from neighborhoods through developments are encouraged to provide connectivity
to open space amenities.
Station Areas
. Station Area Plans will provide additional planning needs around light rail stations
and identify future developmentopportunities. Station area plans identify land uses
around each station, and design and development guidelines that can enhance thepedestrian
environment and encourage transit ridership for the system. The station area plans
shall define other design standardsdetermined necessary to achieve a specific character
for an area. The station area planning process can also evaluate the need forexpanded
TOD
boundaries and/or creating pedestrian linkages along streets as needed. This would
result in an amendment to the
TOD
. Station area planning may include a combination of any of the following:
Land Use Inventory
Existing and projected land uses

CHAPTER 7— - ASU ATHLETIC FACILITIES DISTRICT PLANNING AREA (AFDPA) OVERLAY
Section 5-701 - Purpose and Applicability.
Purpose. The general purpose of the AFDPA is to encourage appropriate development
and redevelopment for transforming anapproximate 276 acre land area generally located
between ASU and Tempe Town Lake into a mixed-use urban community with athleticfields
and facilities.
Applicability. Development standards, review and approval procedures specified by
this chapter shall apply to the development ofAFDPA commercial use, AFDPA residential
use, and mixed uses within the AFDPA. Standards and review procedures specified by
thischapter shall not apply to public university uses and public university related
uses within the AFDPA. Where a conflict exists between aprovision of the AFDPA and
any underlying zoning district or development standard, the AFDPA provision shall
govern.
Design Standards. The design standards applicable to development of AFPDA commercial
use, AFPDA residential use, and mixed useswithin the AFPDA are described in the novus
design standards as may be amended. where appropriate within the AFPDA, standardsand best practices associated with the transportation overlay district shall be encouraged
as described in subsection d and e below.
AFDPA TOD Principles. The transportation oriented development principles of the AFDPA
are as follows:
Promote and increase the use of alternative modes of transportation such as walking,
bicycling, carpooling, riding the bus or lightrail;
Encourage a mix of uses and balance of densities and intensities within identified
activity areas accessible to alternative modes oftransportation;
Provide a quality of urban design (as defined within the standards) that attracts
and encourages pedestrian activity;
Reinforce the public investments and private development to achieve a compact form
of development conducive to walking,bicycling, and transit use; and
Provide facilities that create a safe, accessible, comfortable, and pleasant environment
for people; maintain safe access forautomobiles and adequate parking and minimize
conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians.
AFDPA TOD Design Principles. The AFDPA Transportation Oriented Development Design
Principles are as follows:
Commercial Projects. Design of commercial projects should enhance the urban experience
of the District by considering theunique aspects of each project's ground floor and
upper levels. As with all projects within the District, commercial projects shouldspatially reinforce the public realm.
Residential Projects. Design of residential projects should enhance the urban experience
of the District by considering the uniqueaspects of each project's ground floor and
upper floors. Residential building design should convey the pedestrian circulationaround and through the project to create a safe and livable environment for residents,
visitors, and the public passing by.

Section 6-305 - Planned Area Development Overlay Districts.
Purpose.
The purpose of
Planned Area Development Overlay Districts
is to accommodate, encourage and promote innovativelydesigned
developments
involving residential and/or non-residential land uses, which form an attractive and
harmonious unit of thecommunity. Such a planned
development
may be designed as a large-scale separate entity, able to function as an individualcommunity, neighborhood, or
mixed-use development
; as a small-scale project which requires flexibility because of uniquecircumstances
or design characteristics; or as a transitional area between dissimilar land uses.
This zoning designation recognizes that adherence to a traditional pattern of
development
standards, (i.e. height,
setback
,
lot coverage
)space, bulk and use specifications contained elsewhere in this Code would preclude
the application of the PAD concept. Therefore,where PAD zoning is deemed appropriate
or necessary, traditional zoning regulations are replaced by performance considerations
tofulfill the objectives of the General Plan. The PAD
overlay district
may be tailored to meet the specific
development
representations of anapplication. Hence one (1) PAD overlay may vary considerably
from another overlay.
Applicability
. PAD Overlays may be applied to any zoning district in the City of Tempe and shall
be processed as a zoning mapamendment. A PAD Overlay District may not be used for
an individual detached single-
family dwelling
.
Procedure
.
PAD Overlay Districts shall be processed to the Development Review Commission or Joint
Review Committee, as applicable, usingthe public hearing procedure. PAD Overlay Districts
shall also be processed to the City Council, using the public hearing procedure,after
review and recommendation by the recommending body;
Modifications. Once a PAD Overlay District request has been approved, it can be modified
or amended per
Section 6-312
.Questions as to procedure for modifications to existing PADs shall be determined
by the Zoning Administrator; and
Development Plan Review. A
Development Plan Review
application shall be processed concurrently with a PAD Overlay District,pursuant
to
Section 6-306
.
Approval Criteria.
PAD Overlay District approval shall be based on consideration of the following criteria:
The development fulfills certain goals and objectives in the General Plan, and the
principles and guidelines of other area policyplans. Performance considerations are
established to fulfill those objectives;
Standards requested through the PAD Overlay District shall take into consideration
the location and context for the site for whichthe project is proposed;
The development appropriately mitigates transitional impacts on the immediate surroundings.
Property Owners Associations
. If a property owners association(s) is required, the covenants, conditions and restrictions
shall includeall applicable requirements under the Tempe City Code, and shall be
reviewed by the City Attorney and Community DevelopmentDirector, or designee, to
determine if the association will remain responsible for maintaining common areas
within the
development
.Such covenants, conditions and restrictions shall be recorded with the Maricopa
County Recorder.
Reversion.
A complete building permit application shall be made on or before two (2) years from
the date of City Council approval, orwithin a time stipulated as a condition of approval.
If this condition is not met, the applicant shall be required to appear at a hearingbefore the City Council to determine by Council vote whether the zoning should revert

conduct a site inspection toverify occupancy. If the building has seventy-five percent
(75%) or more of the tenant spaces occupied with residents (forresidential properties)
or active businesses (for commercial properties) then the Community Development Director,
ordesignee, shall grant a one (1) year extension to a PAD Overlay District. This
process may be repeated for additional one (1)year extension requests.

APPENDIX
APPENDIX A. - DESIGN GUIDELINES
A-I. - Purpose and Applicability.
Purpose.
The design guidelines are discretionary criteria which are used in the City's review
of project proposals. They are intended toencourage high quality building and site
design that complements the architecture, landscapes, history, and culture of Tempe
andensures the functionality of the built environment.
Applicability.
The design guidelines are to be applied by the City during project reviews. Applicants
are responsible for addressing theguidelines in their project proposals, and the
City, through its applicable decision making bodies (Part 6 of this Code) may requiremodifications to designs to be consistent with the design guidelines. Where an existing
building or site that is being added onto orremodeled does not meet a design guideline,
the addition or remodel should bring the subject building or site into closer conformancewith the guideline, to the extent practicable given the nature and extent of the alteration.
A-II. - Building Design Guidelines.
Contextual Design Guideline.
Building elevations and materials should have design characteristics that are contextually
appropriate.Contextual relationships are determined through design review and consider:
massing, rhythm, scale, height, roof form, fenestration(windows and doors), articulation/relief,
materials, detailing, lighting, signs, and other features of existing on the site,
if any, andadjacent buildings. Where contrasting design elements are provided, the
applicant must demonstrate how the alternate design isequal or superior to the existing
and/or adjacent building design in terms of compatibility.
New Design Character. A building design that varies from the contextual design guideline
in establishing a new character, may beapproved only after demonstrating that the
proposed design is consistent with the development plan approval criteria in
Section 6-307
and it provides exceptional or unique benefits to the neighborhood or community,
which may include but are not limited tothe following values:
Energy conservation through a certified "green building" or "sustainable development"
project;
Historic preservation; and
Affordable housing.
Accessibility.
Buildings should be accessible for every person, consistent with the Americans with
Disability Act (ADA) and itsimplementing standards and guidelines. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that was enacted in 1990 for thepurpose
of ensuring that all Americans have the same basic rights of access to services and
facilities. The ADA prohibits discrimination
10/15/21, 7:53 PM Tempe, AZ Zoning and Development Code
174/216
C.

on the basis of disabilities. To effect
this prohibition, the statute required certain designated federal agencies to develop
implementingregulations, known as the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG). The guidelines
and standards contained within the ADAAG arecontinually being updated and refined,
and current versions should be reviewed as part of the design process for every project.
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED).
Safe environments and pedestrian activity are interrelated and onecannot exist without
the other. Therefore building designs should support pedestrian activity and provide
natural surveillance ofspaces from key locations inside and next to buildings. This
should be accomplished through the appropriate design and placement ofwindows, entrances,
pedestrian amenities, lighting, outdoor rooms (e.g., balconies, arcades, and similar
features), and activity support.Buildings should incorporate entrances, windows,
balconies, and activities allowing visibility of the street, parking areas, and entrancesfrom inside buildings; and visibility of building entrances and other public gathering
spaces from the street, as generally shown below.Lighting must conform to the provisions
of Part 4, Chapter 8.
The CPTED principles are:
Natural Surveillance
Natural surveillance is the CPTED concept that encourages an open design. It promotes
opportunities for people, as they areengaged in their normal behaviors, to observe
the space around them.
This principle allows people to feel comfortable as they use a space, maintain distance
from intruders that may be in or near thespace, and encourage observation of those
individuals that may be using the space with criminal intent.
Natural Surveillance encourages the design and placement of physical features so as
to maximize visibility. This includes buildingorientation, placement of windows,
building and site entrance and exit locations, refuse containers, landscape materials,
parkinglots, walkways, walls and fences (including the use of wrought iron and similar
materials that promote visibility), signage, and otherphysical obstructions. It may
also include the placement of persons or activities to maximize surveillance possibilities.
Minimally maintained lighting standards that provide for nighttime illumination of
parking lots, walkways, entrances, exits andrelated areas, to promote a safe environment,
are also Natural Surveillance components of good CPTED design.
Access Control
Access control is the CPTED principle directed at decreasing criminal accessibility.
This principle is especially important whereintruders will not be easily observed.
Fences, walls, and actual building location on a site are primary considerations to
accesscontrol. However, provisions of access control must encourage the use of natural
surveillance, where practical, to restrict criminalintrusion into an area.
Intruders are more readily recognized through the proper location and use sidewalks,
pavement variations, gates, lighting, signage,fencing, landscape and other techniques
used to clearly guide the public to and from activity areas and are primary to effectiveaccess control.
Activity Support
Activity support involves the placement on activities where the individuals engaged
in those activities become part of the naturalsurveillance and access control systems.
Examples include:
Placement of safe activities in areas so as to discourage would be offenders. The
goal is to increase the likelihood of good naturalsurveillance and the perception
of safety for normal users, and the perception of risk for the offenders.
Placement of high-risk activities in safer locations to overcome the vulnerability
associated with these activities through the use ofgood natural surveillance and
access control techniques.
The location of gathering areas in places that provides good natural surveillance
and access control.
Territoriality
Territoriality is the CPTED principle that is used to clearly delineate private space
from semi-private and public spaces. Properlyused it creates a sense of ownership
in private and semi-private areas.
Territoriality creates an environment where strangers and intruders stand out and
are more easily identified. This is accomplishedthrough the effective use of signage,
grade changes, fencing, landscape edging, lighting, and any number of imaginative
techniquesthat encourage individuals to take pride in their surroundings and report
criminal activity.

Maintenance
Proper maintenance of landscape, lighting, addressing, and other features can facilitate
the principles of CPTED. It is clear thatAccess Control, Natural Surveillance, and
Territoriality all have a maintenance component. Examples:
Proper maintenance of security lighting to insure that lamps are working properly
and the required minimum lighting level arebeing maintained.
Landscape which is maintained to prescribe standards so as to minimize conflicts between
natural surveillance opportunities andlandscape at maturity.
The recognition of these principles should help guide owners, architects, planners,
and developers of property to design builtenvironments that accomplish the goals
of the police department's crime prevention goals.

areas may include but are not limited to: patios, porches, balconies, rooftop gardens,recreation areas, open space, etc; and
Designated common outdoor living spaces should have dimensions that are not less than
fifteen (15) feet in width and fifteen (15)feet in depth, eight (8) feet in height,
and five hundred (500) square feet in area per space.
A-III. - Bicycle Parking Design Guidelines.
Bicycle Parking Location and Design.
All parking spaces for bicycles should be equipped with a security rack that is designed
and installed in conformance with thePedestrian and Bicycle Facility Design Guidelines,
contained in the Comprehensive Transportation Plan. Bicycle racks other thanthe standard
detail may be approved, subject to design review and approval by the Public Works
Director;
Areas set aside for bicycle parking should be clearly marked and reserved for bicycle
parking only;
Bicycle parking should not impede or create a hazard to pedestrians. Parking areas
should located so as to not conflict with visionclearance standards;
Bicycle parking should be conveniently located with respect to both the street right-of-way
and at least one building entrance (e.g.,no farther away than the closest parking
space). It should be incorporated whenever possible into building design and coordinatedwith the design of street furniture (e.g., benches, street lights, planters and other
pedestrian amenities) when street furniture isprovided;
Bicycle racks should be installed near main building entrances and located in areas
with shade. A pedestrian pathway linking thebicycle parking area to the public sidewalk
and the primary building entrance(s) should be provided;
Site design for bicycle parking should conform to the Pedestrian and Bicycle Facility
Design Guidelines contained in theComprehensive Transportation Plan;

Bicycle parking should be visible to cyclists from street sidewalks or building entrances,
to aid in security from theft and damage; and
Bicycle parking should be least as well lit as vehicle parking for security.
Options for Storage.
Bicycle parking requirements for long-term and employee parking can be met by providing
a bicycle storageroom, bicycle lockers, racks, or other secure storage space inside
or outside of the building.
A-IV. - Landscape Design Guidelines.
General Landscape Guidelines.
Landscape plans should demonstrate that developments satisfy the following guidelines,
asapplicable, and as generally shown in the figures below:
Provide visual screening, privacy and natural surveillance, where needed.
Retain natural vegetation and incorporate it into the landscape design, as practicable;
Define pedestrian pathways and open space areas with landscape materials where appropriate;
Provide focal points within a development, such as specimen trees, hedges, flowering
plants, art and pedestrian amenities;
Use a combination of plants for year-long color and interest; and
Use landscape treatments to enhance the screening of outdoor storage and mechanical
equipment areas, and enhance gradedareas such as earth berms, swales and retention
ponds.

Tree Selection Guidelines.
Tree species should be selected based on growth characteristics and site conditions,
including availablespace, overhead clearance, soil conditions, exposure, and desired
color and appearance. Consideration should be given to:
Provide a broad canopy where shade or screening of tall objects is desired;
Use low-growing trees for spaces under utility wires;
Select trees from which lower branches can be trimmed in order to maintain a healthy
growth habit where vision clearance andnatural surveillance is a concern;
Use narrow or columnar trees where awnings or other building features limit growth,
or where greater visibility is desired betweenbuildings and the street for natural
surveillance; and
Street trees should be planted within existing and proposed planting strips, and in
sidewalk tree wells on streets without plantingstrips. Tree placement should provide
canopy cover (shade) and avoid conflicts with existing trees, retaining walls, utilities,
lighting,and other obstacles.
Screening Guidelines.
The design of screening devices should consider the following guidelines:
Site conditions and adjacent uses should be considered when designing visual screening;
Provide shade over walkways, if appropriate;
Natural surveillance, access control, and privacy needs should be considered; and
General consistency with the guidelines in Figures A-IVA1 and A-IVA2, above.
Wall Design.
All required walls shall be located and designed based on the intended screening function,
proposed use, and adjoininguses, as follows:
Walls placed between a residential district and any commercial use, industrial uses,
or surface parking lot exceeding ten thousand(10,000) square feet shall be constructed
of masonry, concrete, ornamental iron, or equal or better quality material, as approvedthrough design review;
All masonry walls shall have an architectural texture, color and material compatible
with the primary building on site (or onrespective sides). Walls may have ornamental
decorative iron fence panels, vertical pickets with spacing that is consistent with
theUniform Building Code, as an integral part of the design of the wall; and
A living wall or see through ornamental iron fence may be approved as a substitute
for masonry if the wall is not required for visualscreening of mechanical equipment,
outdoor storage areas, or parking areas.

A-V. - Access and Circulation Design Guidelines.
Shared Driveways.
The number of driveway and private street intersections with public streets should
be minimized through the useof shared driveways with adjoining uses where feasible.
The City may require the use of shared driveways through the land use anddevelopment
review process, for traffic safety and access management purposes in accordance with
the following standards:
Shared driveways and frontage streets may be required to consolidate access onto a
collector or arterial street. When shared

driveways or frontage streets are required,
the City may require that they be stubbed to adjacent developable parcels for futureextension. "Stub" means that a driveway or street temporarily ends at the property
line, but may be extended in the future as theadjacent parcel develops. "Developable"
means that a parcel is either vacant or it is likely to receive additional development
due toinfill or redevelopment potential.
Access easements (i.e., for the benefit of affected properties) should be a condition
of land use or development approval andshould be recorded for all shared driveways
prior to occupancy.
Exception. Shared driveways are not required when existing development patterns or
physical constraints (e.g., topography, parcelconfiguration, and similar conditions)
prevent extending the street/driveway with reciprocal access in the future.
On-Site Traffic Calming.
Traffic calming features such as curb extensions, special paving, humps or other features
may be required forthe on-site circulation systems and street access points of larger
developments. Traffic calming measures should conform to thePedestrian and Bicycle
Facility Design Guidelines, contained in the Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
A-VI. - Security Gates Design Guidelines.
The following process and design criteria are for gates that are to be used for access
control to a commercial, industrial or residentialsite:
Process.
Two copies (24"x36") of an overall site plan of the property and an enlarged detailed
site plan (scale: 1" = 20'-0") of thearea in which the gate(s) will be located must
be submitted for Preliminary Site Plan Review for initial city review. Details of
thegates must also be submitted. Final approval must be obtained from Design Review
for the site plan with access control gates.Contact the Community Development Department
(Planning Staff) at 480-350-8331 for questions regarding this process, submittalrequirements
and fees.
Any fence, gate or wall over six (6) feet in height or any self-operating or electronically
controlled gate will require a permit tobe obtained prior to installation. Please
contact the Building Safety Division at 480-350-8341 for permit submittal requirementsand fees.
All gates require Fire Department approval prior to installation. A plan check/inspection
fee will be charged per gate.
Design Criteria.
Please indicate, on the site plan, the required number of parking spaces and the number
of parking spacesprovided for the entire development. The Zoning and Development
Code does not allow walls, gates or fences to occupy anyrequired parking spaces.
If a wall, fence or gate bisects a parking space, it must be surrounded by a landscaped
island thatconforms to the sketch below.
Please refer to the Zoning and Development Code for additional requirements affecting
parking lot layout, lighting, fence andwall locations, and construction materials
for walls.
All walls and gates that are visible from the street must be designed utilizing ornamental
iron (no chain link, razor ribbon orbarbed wire). Walls or fences shall be designed
and finished to relate to other site walls or the main buildings on site.
Pedestrian ingress/egress shall be maintained and meet the requirements of ADA and
the Building Code.
For developments located on arterial or collector streets, the Transportation Division
of the Public Works Department requiresthat an eighty (80) feet stacking distance
be provided between the public sidewalk and the proposed gate or key box, whicheveris closer. A by-pass lane or turn around area must be provided on-site (without requiring
a car to back into entering traffic) forvehicles which are not allowed to enter the
site. Developments located on streets of other classification will be analyzed on
acase-by-case basis.
The main gate shall have an emergency vehicle strobe detector. Knox key switch shall
be installed at all gates unless noted byFire Department. Knox box may be required
upon Fire review. Battery backup shall be provided on gate systems unless the

"fails" in the open position upon loss of power. Fire Prevention requires all gates
to have a minimum drive-thru width oftwenty (20) feet.
Residential developments such as apartments, condominiums, townhomes, or single family,
must provide electronic keypadfor Police Department access through gates.
When a commercial, industrial or residential development utilizes city refuse collection
services, the Refuse Division of thePublic Works Department requires that any gates
are to be kept open from 6:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on refuse collection days,unless
specific arrangements have been made with the Refuse Division. The property owner
or their representative isresponsible for opening and closing all gates.
A-VII. - Pedestrian Oriented Design Guidelines.
The following items are considered desirable to meet the intent of pedestrian oriented
design, but are not required or regulated.Voluntary inclusion of these elements within
a development plan will be used in assessment of meeting the intent of this Code,
per
Section 5-603
(B), Conformance, Option B.
Loading, Delivery and Service Entrances.
Internal loading areas are encouraged where possible, within parking structures or
podium buildings.
Physical separation of loading/delivery/service uses from other uses is preferred.
Design solution should minimize visual impacts of uses, and provide an attractive
aesthetic appearance. Loading areas shouldnot detract from the aesthetic quality
of the surroundings, even in parking areas or at the rear of buildings. This includesdesign of the bumper guards, doors, wall protectors, etc.
Signs.
Consideration should be given to sign placement, hours of illumination or light intensity
of illuminated signs proposed withinnew developments when adjacent or across the
street from existing residential developments with windows facing the newdevelopment.
High contrast and tactile signage are encouraged to support persons with different
abilities. All other sign standardswithin Part 4 are applicable.
Cool Materials.
To mitigate heat island impacts, new and existing developments are encouraged to use
roofing and buildingmaterials that provide high reflectivity and/or high emissivity
as appropriate to use and occupancy. Use permeable paving surfaceswhere appropriate,
and high reflectivity and/or emissivity paving materials. Reflective surface paving
should not be used in largeunshaded areas which create significant eye strain or
contrast to surroundings, and might impair visibility of pedestrians ordrivers.
Accessibility.
All standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as those within the
base code apply. Additionalconsideration should be given to the provision of amenities
that serve persons with different abilities, including extra sidewalkwidths, physical
cues and limited audio distractions for the visually impaired and minimized texture
and changes in surfaceelevation for persons using wheelchairs. All other accessibility
standards within Part 4 are applicable.
Retention.
Underground retention and on-site rainwater storage for irrigation purposes is permitted,
subject to EngineeringDivision review and approval. Permeable surfaces can be used
to decrease area used in calculation for retention. Shared retentionis encouraged
where opportunities for dedicated public open space can be provided.

ARTWORK ELIGIBILITY.
"Artwork or "Work of Art" is defined as an original artist design and produced work
that is imported into or set at the building site. Developersmust hire a Professional
Artist for the creation of the Artwork. The Artist is defined as a professional based
on his/her body of work includedcommissions, exhibits, publications, collections
and educational background. Exclusions included persons primarily working in the professionalfields of architecture, engineering, design, or landscape who do not have a record
of art-based accomplishments as described; persons with abusiness interest in the
development project outside of the creation of the Artwork; and relatives of anyone
with a financial interest with respectto the project at large.
Developers opting to commission a Work for Art to fulfill the Art in Private Development
requirement must ensure the Artwork will be publiclyvisible and accessible at all
times. If Artwork is placed in the interior of a building, the location cannot require
payment for entry to view andexperience the Artwork, and the Artwork must be in an
area that invites the public to loiter as appropriate. Public Art is typically large
scale andmay include sculpture, painting, mosaic, ceramic, installation, video, photography,
works of light, integrated artist designed land works, and otherworks determined
by the Tempe Arts and Culture Department that will satisfy the requirement.
Each proposed Artwork will require the following for review by the City:
Artist Credentials: Including resume, examples of past work, and any other appropriate
materials that speak to the artist'sprofessional history.
Budget: Itemized budget that meets the required art investment for the development.
Budget may include;
Professional artist's budget including artist fees, materials, assistants' labor costs,
insurance, permits, taxes, business and legalexpenses,
Fabrication and installation of the artwork,
Site preparation for the Artwork,
Structures enabling the Artist to display the Artwork,
Acknowledgment plaque identifying the artist, artwork and development.
Any subcontractor fees that relate to the Artwork (engineering, graphic design, welders,
etc).
Materials: Materials used for the Artwork must be reviewed by Public Art Staff with
regards to viability and budget constraints.
Maintenance Plan: All proposed Artworks should include a plan for future maintenance
and cleaning schedule where appropriate.
RESTRICTIONS
Costs for maintaining and operating Artwork shall not be included in the budget
Business logos or art that incorporates a logo
Directional or way finding elements such as supergraphics and signage

APPENDIX F. - SHARED PARKING MODEL
Tempe's "Standard Shared Parking Model" can be used as a basis for predicting the
Parking Demand for a particular mix of uses on asite. The model assumes that every
separate use will actually need the full amount of parking that is called for by the
ratios in theOrdinance at some point (called the "peak" period for the use) during
the day. For example, in the real world, some uses (like nightclubs)peak in the evening;
others (like offices) peak in the morning or afternoon. Where different uses need
parking at different times of theday, there is an opportunity for them to share parking.
This means that the total number of stalls needed to serve a "mixed use" site (theParking Demand) may be significantly less than the number of stalls that would have
to be built if each of the uses had to provideparking on its own (the Parking Required
by this Code).
The Standard Shared Parking Model is a tool for estimating the Parking Demand of a
specific mix of uses. It is called "standard" becauseeach of the demand curves represents
the parking needed for an average, typical use, based on studies and observations
collected bystaff over a number of years. The "curves" are represented below as a
table showing the percent of the Code requirement for such uses,by hour of day.
These curves can be adapted to fit the specific needs of a major tenant on the site.
The advantage of doing this is that the mode will bemore accurate in predicting that
tenant's share of the parking throughout the day. The disadvantage is that the model
will be unique,and may not work as well if that tenant is replaced by an average,
typical user in the future. In addition to changing the curves, onemight also consider
the impact of transit availability (reliable mass transit serving the site), trip
reduction programs (van and carpooling,etc.) and captive market effects (where users
serve patrons who are already on site), as well as any users who might need more parkingthan the Code ratios require. Any modifications to the standard model should be based
on a "professional parking analysis andmanagement study", as described in a companion
information sheet available from the Development Services Department.
Enclosed: Instructions on how to apply model.
PARKING ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT STUDY
Section 4-604
of Tempe's Zoning & Development Code refers to submittal of a professional Parking
Analysis and Management Studywhere applicant is basing his parking on the predicted
demand, rather than on the amount required by Code. To assist in the process,staff
has prepared a more detailed description of the elements in such a Study, in a format
that could be adapted as needed for eachsite:
"
professional
":
The study should be stamped by a Professional Engineer who is registered in the State
of Arizonaand who has extensive experience with traffic and parking issues in private
development. Theconsultant's qualifications should be briefly described in the study.
"
analysis

current andproposed uses on the site.
(d) An estimate of the parking demand for the site, along with the methodology (tables,
graphs,assumptions, etc.) supporting that estimate.
(e) A discussion of the probable scenarios and problems that will need to be addressed
if theparking is provided in relation to demand, as proposed.
(f) Any special conditions to protect the public interest recommended by the consultant
if theproject is approved as proposed.
"
management
":
A summary of all implementation strategies needed to deal with the anticipated problemsmentioned in (e) above, promoting any or all of the following, for example:
(1) Ride sharing (incentives for carpools, vanpooling, set up programs to encourage
high occupancyvehicles through specific incentives and policies, etc.).
(2) Transit use (utilize flexible subsidies and fringe benefits, locate transit stops
strategically, etc.
(3) Alternative styles of transportation (encourage bicycles, motorcycles, walking,
consider marketrates for employee parking, promote off-peak trips, etc.
(4) Convenient pedestrian circulation on-site (quality design of walkways, consider
trams, createparking zones, cluster uses sharing customers, etc.
(5) Efficient use of parking (supply a mix of short-term and long-term parking, cluster
uses sharingparking minimize reserved spaces, consider permits, etc.).
(6) Effective management (assign administrative responsibility for program to one
person, section orcompany, achieve consistency in policy and enforcement, undertake
periodic monitoring, file updatereports with City, review impact of new tenants,
etc.).
To use the model, take the following steps:
Verify that all uses on site have equal access to all parking spaces on site, that
there are cross access easements across all propertylines, and that there are no
legal impediments to sharing the parking.
List all uses on the site.
Parking Required: Calculate the parking required for each use according to the ratios
in the Code.
Adjust for transit, trip reduction, captive market or surplus need effects; if you
change the model, state your assumptions clearly.
Group the uses according to the categories in Table I.
Add up the total number of spaces required for each group.
Multiply that number times the percent shown in the Tables ("80" means 80% or .8 of
the Code requirement) for each hour for

each group.
Add up the total number of spaces needed by hour of day.
Parking Demand: Find the maximum number of spaces needed by hour of day: this will
represent the minimum number of spacesthat the particular mix will actually need.
Parking Provided: Add between 5% (for larger sites with stable Demand throughout the
year) and 10% (for small sites with aDemand that fluctuates throughout the year)
to the Parking Demand to get a realistic estimate of the amount of parking youshould
