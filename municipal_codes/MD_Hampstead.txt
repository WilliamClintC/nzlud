be elected, and the person receiving the second highest number of
votes shall be elected, but if there also is a tie for the second highest
number of votes, there shall be a special runoff election between such
persons for the third Council seat; and if there is no tie between persons

complainant of its decision to dismiss the complaint within 120
days of receiving a complaint.
(1)

the Town Attorney, which must include any facts or defenses raised
by the respondent after proper notice by the Town Attorney, the

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR ENFORCEMENT OF
TOWN CODE
§ 25-4 HAMPSTEAD CODE § 25-4
30:44
ARTICLE I
Introduction and Process
§ 30-1. Introduction.
§ 30-2. Overview of process.
It is the purpose and intent of the Town Council to establish
administrative procedures for obtaining prompt compliance in the
correction of both major and minor violations of the Hampstead Town
Code.
A.
The procedures established in and through this chapter may cross
reference, consolidate or incorporate by reference, as applicable,
enforcement methods established elsewhere in the Town Code, in order
to create a uniform process for prompt Code compliance,
administrative due process and effective enforcement.
B.
The Town Manager and the Town Attorney are each authorized to
utilize and initiate the procedures established in this chapter and in
the Town Code. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or
constrain in any way the powers of the Hampstead Chief of Police or
any sworn law enforcement officer to enforce any criminal violations of
local, county or state law.
C.
The procedures in this chapter may be used as a supplement to criminal
or judicial enforcement action, or both, or in lieu thereof. Selection
of one method shall not preclude the use of any other method or
combination of methods when appropriate.
D.
Violations of the Town Code including those affecting uses of or
conditions upon real property may be corrected through the issuance
of a notice of violation to the responsible party. The notice shall specify
any required actions necessary to come into compliance with the Town
Code. The responsible party will be allowed a reasonable period of
time in which to correct the violation. In violations pertaining to real
property, the owner(s) of the property shall be considered the
responsible party. The time to respond is normally determined by the
chapter of the Town Code that governs the violation. Absent a specific
statutory time period, the time to respond shall not be less than 10
calendar days. Failure to comply within the time prescribed can result
in the issuance of a municipal citation in accordance with the Town
Code or any other method or combination of methods deemed
appropriate. The Town Manager and Town Attorney shall have the
discretionary authority to extend the time to respond or the time to
correct a violation for good cause.
A.
A municipal citation is a notice to the responsible party which mandates
the corrective action and establishes a fine as a penalty for the prior
noncompliance of the notice of violation. Subsequent citations may be
issued with increased penalty. Corrective action that may be required
B.
§ 30-1 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR § 30-2
30:45
of a responsible party includes, but is not limited to, the removal of
encroachments into public property, the mitigation or restoration of
land or adjoining property, the removal or modification of blockages
of ways and the removal of structures to rectify any code violation
or the abatement of any hazardous condition. Corrective action also
may include any other process necessary for abatement of a violation.
In addition, the responsible party can be made subject to an order of
abatement through which the corrective work will be undertaken by the
Town and the cost will be imposed as a lien against the property if the
responsible party fails to respond and fully correct the violation.
Each day a violation exists is a continuing and additional violation, and
all remedies, penalties and assessments are cumulative.
C.
In addition to a notice of violation, a cease-and-desist order can be
issued to one or more responsible parties or other persons who perform
work in violation of a permit or without a required permit. Violation
of the cease-and-desist order is a separate misdemeanor. A responsible
party or any person on scene actively conducting the violation under
the direction of a responsible party is subject to arrest without a
warrant for continuing work in violation of the cease-and-desist order,
as well as for the actions constituting the original violation. A
responsible party can be required to obtain necessary permits, restore
the property, or both, and correct or mitigate the consequences of
the violation. Municipal citations can also be issued assessing
administrative fines for both the creation of and the continuance of the
violation.
D.
If the responsible party fails or refuses to correct the violation,
proceedings may be undertaken to abate any existing or resulting
nuisance. Abatement orders authorize a municipal employee or
authorized private contractor to enter upon property and correct the
violation or condition, or the removal of encroachment upon public
property. Enforcement costs may be imposed against the responsible
party and noncomplying property.
E.
During the inspection and enforcement process, cost recovery can be
imposed for the cost of reinspection and the costs of Town services
to abate a violation. These costs may be recorded as a lien against
the property following the procedures under this chapter or the waiver
thereof by the responsible party.
F.
Various steps or procedures under this chapter may require notice
and a hearing. When appropriate, notice and hearing requirements for
separate administrative actions may be consolidated.

ARTICLE II
Administrative Warrants
§ 30-3. Right of entry for inspections.
Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any municipal
ordinance or other applicable statute or regulations, or whenever there
is reasonable cause to believe there exists a violation in any building
or upon any premises or property within the jurisdiction of the Town of
Hampstead, any authorized official of the Town may, upon presentation
of proper credentials, enter such building, premises or property at all
reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed
upon him or her by municipal ordinance or other applicable statute
or regulations. Except in emergency situations or when consent of the
owner and/or occupant to the inspection has been otherwise obtained,
the authorized official of the Town shall give the owner and/or
occupant, if they can be located after reasonable effort, at least 24
hours' written notice of the Town official's intention to inspect.
A.
The notice transmitted to the owner and/or occupant shall state that the
property owner and/or occupant has the right to refuse entry and that
in the event such entry is refused, inspection may be made only upon
issuance of an administrative warrant by the Circuit Court of Carroll
County. In the event the owner and/or occupant refuses entry after
such request has been made, the Town Manager and/or Town Attorney
are hereby empowered to seek assistance from any court of competent
jurisdiction in obtaining an inspection warrant for such entry. It is
a misdemeanor to willfully refuse access after an inspection warrant
has been duly issued. The above twenty-four-hour notice requirement
shall not apply to any inspection where the authorized official conducts
the observations and inspection while within the public right-of-way or
within the unobstructed walkway between such right-of-way and the
front entry of any residence.

Notice
§ 30-4. Service of notices.
Except as provided herein, whenever a notice is required to be given
under the Town Code for the enforcement of a proposed order or
for hearing or appeals purposes, the notice shall be served by any
of the following methods, unless different provisions are otherwise
specifically stated to apply:
(1) Personal service upon the responsible party; or
Certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested.
Simultaneously, a duplicate notice may be sent by regular mail,
postage prepaid. If a notice that is sent by certified mail is returned
unsigned, service shall be deemed effective pursuant to service of
the duplicate notice by regular mail; provided, that the duplicate
notice sent by regular mail is not returned as undeliverable. Notice
shall be mailed to the last address shown on the county Tax
Assessor's records if the notice concerns real property, and to the
last known address of any other party to the proceeding shown in
official records of the Town of Hampstead;
(2)
(3) Posting the notice conspicuously on or in front of the property.
A.
Posting a notice or duplicate service by regular mail in the manner
described above shall be deemed effective on the third day after mailing
or posting; service by certified mail shall be effective as of the date of
signed receipt.
B.
The service of an initial notice of violation may also be sent by regular
mail. Service of a notice of violation by regular mail is effective on the
third day after mailing.
C.
Service of notice through which a lien will be placed upon real property
will be in accordance with applicable regulations.
D.
The failure of any party or person with an interest in the property
or the proceeding to receive any notice which has been duly sent or
posted in accordance with this section shall not affect the validity of any
proceedings taken under this Code.

ARTICLE IV
Enforcement
§ 30-5. Nonissuance of permits.
After a notice of violation has been recorded against the property pursuant
to the Town Code, Town manager shall withhold the issuance of any
municipal permits as allowed by law upon that property, save for those
permits necessary to correct the violation(s). A party whose permits are
to be withheld shall be given notice as part of the administrative process
outlined in this chapter.
§ 30-6. Cease-and-desist orders.
§ 30-7. Municipal citations.
The Town Manager and/or Town Attorney are authorized to issue
personally, or to serve in accordance with the Hampstead Code, a
written cease-and-desist order upon any person violating a provision
of the Town Code through which work is being performed without a
permit, if required, or in violation of an issued permit.
A.
It is unlawful for any responsible party or any other person to whom a
cease-and-desist order has been personally issued or served to continue
to perform work or use property in violation of the terms of that order.
B.
Prosecution under this section does not bar prosecution or
administrative enforcement, or both, of the previous underlying
violations for any or all days the violation had been in existence, or for
the continuance of the underlying violation.
C.
The Town Manager and Town Attorney may initiate other administrative
enforcement and compliance methods in accordance with this chapter.
D.
A municipal citation can be issued to a responsible party for violation of
a regulatory provision of the Town Code or other law, statute, ordinance
or regulation where the Town of Hampstead has delegated authority,
and the responsible party be required to pay an administrative fine.
A.
A municipal citation may be issued in lieu of the initiation of a criminal
action for the same violation. However, in particularly egregious cases,
criminal enforcement may be appropriate for continuing violations if
the administrative citation is ignored by the responsible party.
B.
The amount of a municipal citation that may be imposed for each
separate violation of the same code section is specified by specific
chapters of the Town Code. Where a specific statutory limit is not
imposed, the administrative fine imposed by a municipal citation shall
not exceed $500 per violation.
C.
Issuance of a municipal citation and payment of the fine does not
excuse compliance and corrective action regarding the violations.
D.
§ 30-5 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR § 30-7
30:51
Although continuing violations of the municipal code are separate
offenses, the responsible party shall be allowed a reasonable time in
which to correct the violation before a second or subsequent municipal
citation may be issued except as otherwise authorized by the Town
Code.
The municipal citation shall contain the information as required by
Maryland State law.
E.
Municipal citations may be appealed under the rules of Circuit Court of
Carroll County.

ARTICLE V
Construction, Repair and Replacement of Utilities in Public Ways
[Adopted 4-14-2005 by Ord. No. 411]
§ 116-24. Purpose.
The Town of Hampstead monitors utility work through the utility permitting
process. This process allows the Town to coordinate activities between
Town and other utilities, to maintain a record of street cuts and patches and
to identify specific Town requirements.
§ 116-25. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
MAJOR UTILITY WORK  Any work where 100 or more square feet of
pavement, curb, gutter, driveway apron or sidewalk is disturbed or where a
lateral cut is made across the travel lanes of a public street.
MINOR UTILITY WORK  Any work where less than 100 square feet of
pavement, curb, gutter, driveway apron or sidewalk is disturbed.
RIGHT-OF-WAY  Any public street, road, sidewalk, trail, way, easement or
right-of-way.
§ 116-26. Permit required.
Any work within a right-of-way which disturbs the pavement, curb and/or
gutter, driveway apron, sidewalk, landscaping or grassed area requires a
permit. This work may include, but is not limited to, utility main and/or
lateral replacement and repair; valve replacement or repair; installation
of new underground mains or laterals, structures or accessories; splices,
buried drops (under pavement or sidewalks); pole changes; boxes and vault
installations and jacking or boring under a right-of-way where disturbance
in the right-of-way within may occur. Any utility work that does not disturb
the right-of-way is exempt from the permitting requirements except to
the extent that traffic detours or lane closures must be approved by the
Superintendent of Public Works and/or his/her designee.
§ 116-27. Emergency street cuts.
The Superintendent of Public Works and/or his/her designee may, if the
public safety requires immediate action, grant permission to make a
necessary street cut or excavation before a permit is issued. If the utility
company and/or contractor fail in a good faith effort to secure this
permission, then the utility company and/or contractor may proceed with an
emergency street cut; however, the utility company and/or contractor shall
notify the Town as soon thereafter as practicable but in no case later than
the first working day after such work occurs.
§ 116-24 (RESERVED) § 116-28
114:127
§ 116-28. Obtaining permits.
Before work within the right-of-way is started, the necessary permit shall be
obtained from the Town Manager. The fee for such permit shall be $100 or
as hereinafter amended by resolution of the Council.
§ 116-29. Responsibility.
The utility company and/or contractor receiving the permit is held
responsible for the work performed and the Town of Hampstead will contact
the specific utility company for required adjustments or corrections
regardless of whether the utility performed the work itself or subcontracted
and assigned the work. The permit is issued to the utility company, and it is
solely responsible for the work performed.
§ 116-30. Inspection.
In all cases, the permit applicant for a street cut shall notify the Town when
the work will commence so, if necessary, arrangements can be made to have
an inspector present while the work is in progress. The applicant may be
billed for the necessary expense of the inspector.
§ 116-31. Street cuts and new pavement.
No permit shall be granted for making an excavation or opening within the
limits of a street which will result in permanent or prolonged interference
with the public use of the street.
Open cuts. No permit to make an opening or excavation in or under
a paved street shall be granted within five years after the completion
of any paving or resurfacing thereof. Paved streets that have been
resurfaced within five years will be subject to bore and jack of the street
unless authorized by Town Manager.
A.
Saw cuts. All pavement cuts shall be saw cut in a straight manner and
shall be made at right angles or parallel with the center line of the
pavement. Saw cuts are not required in the initial pavement excavation
for minor utility work; however, final restoration of the street or public
way shall require saw cuts.
B.
Emergency openings. Pavement less than five years old may be cut
in emergency situations as determined by the Town Manager or the
Superintendent of Public Works.
C.
Temporary patching. Temporary asphalt ("cold") patch is only
authorized for repair related to minor utility work. Where a temporary
asphalt patch is used, permanent restoration of the street or rightof-
way shall be done within 30 days of the completion of work. An
extension may be granted by the Town due to conditions such as
weather.
D.

114:128
§ 116-32. General responsibilities.
The utility company or its subcontractors shall have a copy of the permit
on the job site at all times. Utility companies shall be responsible for the
condition of any right-of-way repairs. Pavement repairs shall be warranted
for three years. Should the condition of the patch become such that
additional pavement is in jeopardy of failure, the utility company may be
held responsible for an area larger than the original repair. Other repairs
(sidewalks, curb and gutter, trenches, etc.) shall be warranted for three
years.
§ 116-33. Standards.
All work shall be done to standards established by the Town. In the
absence of a municipal standard, all utility work shall be done to the
standards promulgated by the Maryland State Highway Administration
for such work.
A.
Whenever a part of a block, square or section of curb, sidewalk or
driveway is broken or damaged by the person making any excavation or
opening in or under any street, alley or public place, the entire block,
square or section shall be removed to the score, groove or saw cut line
and replaced or reconstructed to the original thickness.
B.
In granting any permit, the Town Manager or Superintendent of Public
Works may attach such other conditions thereto as may be reasonably
necessary to prevent damage to public or private property or to prevent
the operation from being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or
property or in a manner likely to create a nuisance or to ensure the
cost of any necessary repairs during the warranty period are bonded.
Such conditions may include, but shall not be limited to: a) limitations
on the period of one year in which the work may be performed; b)
restrictions as to the size and type of equipment commensurate with
the work to be done; c) designation of routes upon which materials
may be transported; d) the place and manner of disposal of excavated
materials; e) requirements as to the laying of dust, the cleaning of

regulations as to the use of streets in the course of the work; g) a
requirement to post a bond with the Town in an amount no greater than
the estimated cost of the work necessary to restore the public way or
easement.
C.
The permit holder shall notify the Department of Public Works in
writing upon completion of all major utility work accomplished under
the provisions of the permit. The Superintendent of Public Works and/
or his/her designee shall issue a certificate of final inspection to each
permit holder for major utility work three years after the permanent
restoration of the excavation has been made, provided that the work
authorized by the permit has been performed according to the Town
specifications. Prior to the issuance of a certificate, the Superintendent

deemed a separate offense subject to cumulative fines and other penalties.
The remedies provided for in this section are cumulative and not exclusive
and shall be in addition to any other remedies provided by the law.
of Public Works and/or his/her designee shall make a full inspection of
the restoration to determine whether the Town specifications have been
adhered to. If any settlement in a restored area occurs within three
years from the date of completion of the permanent restoration, any
expense incurred by the Town in correcting such settlement shall be
paid by the permit holder or recovered from the posted bond, unless
the permit holder submits proof satisfactory to the Town Manager or
Superintendent of Public Works that the settlement was not due to
defective backfilling.
In no case shall any opening made by a permit holder be considered
in the charge or care of the Town or any of its officers or employees,
and no officer or employee is authorized in any way to take or assume
any jurisdiction over any such opening, except in the exercise of police
power when it is necessary to protect life and property.

With the exception of those facilities for which the developer's rights and
obligations are to be established in a development rights and
responsibilities agreement with the Town pursuant to Article IX of this
chapter, before a preliminary subdivision plan approval may be given, the
Commission shall receive written certification, as specified in the following
provisions, to verify that the proposed subdivision meets all applicable
state, county and Town codes. Certifications shall automatically expire 120
days from the date of completion whenever a time limit is not specified. The
Commission shall deny or defer approval of the plan if any one or more of
these conditions cannot be provided or received by the Town.
The proposed subdivision shall be posted conspicuously by a notice
no less in size than 22 by 28 inches at least 14 days before the date
of the first Commission meeting at which preliminary approval of the
proposed subdivision is to be considered.
A.
The proposed subdivision shall comply with all applicable provisions
of the Code of the Town of Hampstead and all other applicable state
and county codes and provisions. More stringent design provisions may

The Commission shall certify the adequacy of all public schools which
are to service the proposed subdivision, using the enrollment figures
and projections supplied by the Board of Education. An elementary
school which has an enrollment of 100% to 105% of capacity shall be
deemed as "approaching inadequate." An elementary school which has
an enrollment of greater than 105% of capacity shall be deemed as
"inadequate." A secondary school which has an enrollment of 100%
to 110% of capacity shall be deemed as "approaching inadequate."
A secondary school which has an enrollment of greater than 110%

County, to begin within three years of preliminary approval.
The Commission shall require that all wells which the developer is
required to supply to the Town, that are to provide the Town with
the additional water necessary for the proposed subdivision, are tested
by a licensed state-certified firm hired by the Town, to certify the
adequacy of both the quantity and quality of the water as set forth in
§ 132-12 of the Code of the Town of Hampstead. A non-interest-bearing
escrow account will be maintained by the Town and funded by the
developer prior to the hiring of the firm, for the cost of the certification.
The developer will have operational control of the development of the
well(s). If the findings of this certification show that the developer is
unable to supply water for the proposed subdivision which meets the
requirements of § 132-12A, the Commission may grant preliminary plan
approval only if the Hampstead Town Manager, through an engineering
study, certifies that the existing water system of the Town has the
excess capacity to service the proposed subdivision. Under such a
circumstance, the developer shall be required to pay the water
replacement fee set forth in § 132-12B.
H.
The Commission shall require that all streets, street sections and
intersections which are to service the proposed subdivision be certified
as to their adequacy by a licensed firm hired by the Town. A noninterest-
bearing escrow account will be maintained by the Town and
funded by the developer prior to the hiring of the firm, for the cost of
the certification. The Commission shall designate the area that must
be certified within 60 days following the concept plan approval. The
Commission shall also require county certification whenever a county
road is within the designated area. If any street, street section or
intersection is certified as inadequate by either agent, the Commission
must be reasonably assured that a solution will be provided or received
within four years of the date of preliminary approval. The firm
preparing the certification shall use the methodology in the Highway
Capacity Manual (current edition) for the rating of all streets and street
sections. The firm shall use the methodology of Critical Lane Analysis
in the rating of all intersections. Ratings of A, B, C or D will be deemed
adequate, while an E or F rating will be deemed inadequate.
I.
The proposed subdivision shall be certified by the County Fire
Protection Engineer as to the local Fire Department's ability to
adequately access and provide the proposed subdivision with fire
protection and emergency services. Such certification shall include any
comments by the local Fire Chief.
J.
The proposed subdivision shall be certified by the Chief of the Town
Police Department as to the Police Department's ability to provide
adequate police protection. This certification shall address the ratio of
officers per citizen. A ratio of one officer to every 1,000 citizens will be
deemed adequate.

Whenever any one or a combination of the requirements of § 119-22 are
not met or any such facility or facilities are deemed inadequate by the
state, county, Town or their hired agent, the Commission shall deny or
defer the approval of the preliminary subdivision plan until such a time as
those inadequacies are provided for or assured. The Commission may, in its
discretion, recommend to the Hampstead Town Council that an exception
for approval be made. If a recommendation for an exception is made by
the Commission, the approval or disapproval of the proposed plan will be
deferred until the Council makes a determination. The Council shall hold
a hearing promptly after the recommendation and render a decision at the
first Council meeting following the hearing. The Council may either grant
the exception recommended by the Commission; grant the recommended
exception subject to certain conditions, which it may impose; or deny the
exception. If the Council denies the exception, the Commission shall
disapprove the plan. If the Council grants the exception subject to
conditions, the Commission has the discretion to approve the plan with the
conditions as set by the Council or disapprove the plan. If the Council grants
the exception with no conditions, the Commission shall approve the plan.
The proposed subdivision shall be certified by Hampstead's Town
Manager as to the Town's ability to provide the proposed subdivision
with solid waste removal under the current contract.
L.
The developer shall provide a written approval from the State Secretary
of Transportation and CSX Transportation (CSXT) or its successors for
any railroad crossings that are to be built. As long as the scope of
the proposed plan does not change and neither the State Secretary of
Transportation or CSXT revokes their approval, the railroad crossing
approvals will not expire and may be used at future approvals.
M.
The proposed subdivision shall be certified by the county as to the
county's ability to provide the sewerage capacity necessary for the
proposed subdivision. The certification must indicate whether the
county has the proper permit(s) and capacity to accommodate the
additional sewerage of the proposed subdivision.
N.
The proposed subdivision shall be reviewed by the county as to its
conformance with all applicable state, county and Town codes, with
written reviews from all applicable county departments. The proposed
subdivision shall be certified by the county as to the proposed
subdivision's conformance with all county adequate facilities
ordinances.

A secondary school which has an enrollment of 100% to 110%
of capacity shall be deemed as "approaching inadequate." A
secondary school which has an enrollment of greater than 110% of
capacity shall be deemed as "inadequate."
(2)
When a school is deemed as "approaching inadequate," the
Commission may decrease the number of lots and/or dwelling units
to be recorded per year. This provision may be applied when
enrollment projections indicate the school will become
"inadequate" (as defined above) during the development of the
subdivision and there is no school project forecasted in the most
recently adopted Capital Improvements Program of Carroll County
that will eliminate the projected inadequacy.
(3)
The Commission shall deny or defer final approval of the proposed
subdivision if any school that will service the proposed subdivision
is inadequate under this requirement, unless there is a school
project in the most recently adopted Capital Improvements
Program (CIP) of Carroll County that will eliminate the inadequacy,
funded for construction to begin within two years of final approval.
(4)
G.
The Commission shall require that all wells which the developer is
required to supply to the Town, that are to provide the Town with the
additional water necessary for the proposed subdivision, are tested by
a licensed state-certified firm hired by the Town to certify the adequacy
of both the quantity and quality of the water as set forth in § 132-12
of the Code of the Town of Hampstead. A non-interest-bearing escrow
account will be maintained by the Town and funded by the developer
prior to the hiring of the firm, for the cost of the certification. If the
findings of this certification show that the developer is unable to supply
water for the proposed subdivision, which meets the requirements of
§ 132-12A, the Commission may grant approval of the final plan only if
the Hampstead Town Manager, through an engineering study, certifies
that the existing water system of the Town has the excess capacity
to service the proposed subdivision. Under such a circumstance, the
developer shall be required to pay the water replacement fee set forth
in § 132-12B.
H.
The Commission shall require that all streets, street sections and
intersections which are to service the proposed subdivision be certified
I.
§ 119-26 HAMPSTEAD CODE § 119-26

as to their adequacy by a licensed firm hired by the Town. A noninterest-
bearing escrow account will be maintained by the Town and
funded by the developer prior to the hiring of the firm, for the cost of
the certification. The Commission shall require that the area designated
in the previous approval process be recertified for adequacy. The
Commission shall also require county certification whenever a county
road is within the designated area. If any street, street section or
intersection is certified as inadequate by either agent, the Commission
must be reasonably assured that a solution will be provided or received
within three years of the date of final approval. The firm preparing the
certification shall use the methodology in the Highway Capacity Manual
(current edition) for the rating of all streets and street sections. The
firm shall use the methodology of Critical Lane Analysis in the rating of
all intersections. Ratings of A, B, C or D will be deemed adequate, while
an E or F rating will be deemed inadequate.
The proposed subdivision shall be certified by the County Fire
Protection Engineer as to the local Fire Department's ability to
adequately access and provide the proposed subdivision with fire
protection and emergency services.
J.
The proposed subdivision shall be certified by the Chief of the Town
Police Department as to the Police Department's ability to provide
adequate police protection. This certification shall address the ratio of
officers per citizen. A ratio of one officer to every 1,000 citizens will be
deemed adequate.
K.
The proposed subdivision shall be certified by Hampstead's Town
Manager as to the Town's ability to provide the proposed subdivision
with solid waste removal under the current contract.
L.
The Commission shall have a written agreement, approved by the
Council, signed by CSXT and the developer for any railroad crossing
which is to be built, before final approval may be given.
M.
The proposed subdivision shall be certified by the county as to the
county's ability to provide the sewerage capacity necessary for the
proposed subdivision. The certification must indicate whether the
county has the proper permit(s) and capacity to accommodate the
additional sewerage of the proposed subdivision.
N.
The proposed subdivision shall be reviewed by the county as to its
conformance with all applicable state, county and Town codes, with
written reviews from all applicable county departments. The proposed
subdivision shall be certified by the county as to the proposed
subdivision's conformance with all county adequate facilities
ordinances.
O.
The approved subdivision shall have an executed public works
agreement (PWA) and have grading permits issued within one year of
the date of final approval, or the approval will automatically expire
and the subdivision must then be resubmitted for final approval. The
P.

§ 119-27. Denial or deferral of approval.
Whenever any one or a combination of the requirements of § 119-26 are
not met or any such facility or facilities are deemed inadequate by the
state, county, Town or their hired agent, the Commission shall deny or
defer the approval of the final subdivision plan until such a time as those
inadequacies are provided for or assured. The Commission may, in its
discretion, recommend to the Hampstead Town Council that an exception
for approval be made. If a recommendation for an exception is made by
the Commission, the approval or disapproval of the proposed plan will be
deferred until the Council makes a determination. The Council shall hold
a hearing promptly after the recommendation and render a decision at the
first Council meeting following the hearing. The Council may either grant
the exception recommended by the Commission; grant the recommended
exception subject to certain conditions, which it may impose; or deny the
exception. If the Council denies the exception, the Commission shall
disapprove the plan. If the Council grants the exception subject to
conditions, the Commission has the discretion to approve the plan with the
conditions as set by the Council or disapprove the plan. If the Council grants
the exception with no conditions, the Commission shall approve the plan.

§ 120-9 HAMPSTEAD CODE § 120-9
120:176
Before a final plan site approval may be given, the Commission shall
receive written certification as specified in the following provisions, to
verify that the proposed development meets all applicable state, county
and town codes. Certifications shall automatically expire 120 days from
the date of completion whenever a time limit is not specified. The
Commission shall deny or defer approval of the plan if any one or more
of the following conditions cannot be provided or received by the Town:
The site plan shall comply with all applicable provisions of the
Code of the Town of Hampstead and all other applicable state and
county codes and provisions. More stringent design provisions may
be required by the Commission if it is demonstrated that they are
necessary to promote the public health, safety or welfare or to
promote good site design.
(1)
The site plan shall be in conformance with the Town of Hampstead
and Environs Comprehensive Plan.
(2)
The site plan shall be in conformance with the Carroll County Water
and Sewer Master Plan.
(3)
The site plan shall not violate the provisions of any enforceable
deed restrictions or covenants attached to the property.
(4)
The Commission shall certify the adequacy of all public schools
which are to service the proposed development using the
enrollment figures and projections supplied by the Board of
Education. An elementary school which has an enrollment of 100%
to 105% of capacity shall be deemed as approaching inadequate.
An elementary school which has an enrollment of greater than
105% of capacity shall be deemed as inadequate. A secondary
school which has an enrollment of 100% to 110% of capacity shall
be deemed as approaching inadequate. A secondary school which
has an enrollment of greater than 110% of capacity shall be
deemed as inadequate. When a school is deemed as approaching
inadequate, the Commission may decrease the number of lots and/
or dwelling units to be recorded or built per year. This provision
may be applied when enrollment projections indicate the school
will become inadequate (as defined below) during the construction
of the development and there is no school project forecasted in the
most recently adopted Capital Improvements Program of Carroll
County that will eliminate the projected inadequacy. The
Commission shall deny or defer approval of the proposed site plan
if a school which will service the site is inadequate under this
requirement unless there is a school project in the most recently
adopted Capital Improvements Program (CIP) of Carroll County
that will eliminate the inadequacy funded for construction to begin
within two years of final approval. Commercial and industrial site
plans may be exempt from this provision by the Commission.

D.
§ 120-9 SITE PLANS § 120-9
120:177
The Commission shall require that all wells which the developer is
required to supply to the Town, that are to provide the Town with
the additional water necessary for the proposed development, are
tested by a licensed state certified firm hired by the Town, to certify
the adequacy of both the quantity and quality of the water as set
forth in § 132-12 of the Code of the Town of Hampstead. A noninterest-
bearing escrow account will be maintained by the Town
and funded by the developer prior to the hiring of the firm, for the
cost of the certification. If the findings of this certification show
that the developer is unable to supply water for the development
which meets the requirements of § 132-12A, the Commission may
grant approval only if the Hampstead Town Manager, through an
engineering study, certifies that the existing water system of the
Town has the excess capacity to service the proposed development.
Under such a circumstance, the developer shall be required to pay
the water replacement fee set forth in § 132-12B. Site plans which
are a part of a previously approved residential development may be
exempt from this provision by the Commission.
(6)
The Commission shall require that all streets, street sections and
intersections which are to service the proposed development be
certified as to their adequacy by a licensed firm hired by the
Town. A non-interest-bearing escrow account will be maintained
by the Town and funded by the developer, for the cost of the
certification. The Commission shall designate the area that must
be certified immediately following the submission of the site plan
to the Commission. The Commission shall also require county
certification whenever a county road is within the designated area.
If any street, street section or intersection is certified as
inadequate by either agent, the Commission must be reasonably
assured that a solution will be provided or received within three
years of the date of approval. The firm preparing the certification
shall use the methodology in the Highway Capacity Manual
(current edition) for the rating of all streets and street sections.
The firm shall use the methodology of Critical Lane Analysis in the
rating of all intersections. Ratings of A, B, C or D will be deemed
adequate, while an E or F rating will be deemed inadequate. Sites
which are a part of a previously approved residential development
may be exempt from this provision by the Commission.
(7)
The site plan shall be certified by the County Fire Protection
Engineer as to the local Fire Department's ability to adequately
access and provide the site with fire protection and emergency
services. Such certification shall include any comments by the local
Fire Chief.
(8)
The site plan shall be certified by the Chief of the Town Police
Department as to the Police Department's ability to provide
adequate police protection. This certification shall address the
ratio of officers per citizen. Commercial and industrial site plans

may be exempt from this provision by the Commission. A ratio of
one officer to every 1,000 citizens will be deemed adequate.
The site plan shall be certified by Hampstead's Town Manager as
to the Town's ability to provide the site with solid waste removal
under the current contract. Commercial and industrial site plans
shall be exempt from this provision.
(10)
The Commission shall have a written agreement, approved by the
Council, signed by CSXT and the developer for any railroad
crossing which is to be built, before final approval may be given.
Sites which are a part of a previously approved development may
be exempt from this provision. The developer shall provide a
written approval from the State Secretary of Transportation for any
railroad crossings that are to be built.
(11)
The site plan shall be certified by the county as to the county's
ability to provide the sewerage capacity necessary for the site.
The certification must indicate whether the county has the proper
permit(s) and capacity to accommodate the additional sewerage of
the proposed use of the site.
(12)
The site plan shall be reviewed by the county as to its conformance
with all applicable state, county and Town codes, with written
reviews from all applicable county departments. The site plan shall
be certified by the county as to the site plan's conformance with all
county adequate facilities ordinances.
(13)
Upon approval of the final site plan, the applicant shall be required
to execute a public works agreement to construct such required
improvements as are located within public rights-of-way or easements
or as are connected to any public facility and shall guarantee such
construction in the amount of the estimated cost of the required
improvements as determined by the Town.
E.
The approved final site plan shall have an executed public works
agreement (PWA) and have grading permits issued within one year of
the date of final approval and shall have construction started within
two years for a residential site plan, three years for a commercial site
plan and three years for an industrial site plan or the approval will
automatically expire and the site plan must then be resubmitted for site
plan approval. The site plan will be subject to the regulations in force
at the time of resubmission.
A.
The Commission may establish a specific expiration date for an
approved site plan which is later than when the approved site plan
would otherwise expire, but only if the Commission approves the later
expiration date at the same time it approves the site plan; the approved
site plan is part of a larger development with an approved phasing plan

removed any tree or part thereof which is in an unsafe condition or
which by reason of its nature is injurious to sewers, electric powerlines,
gas lines, waterlines or other public improvements or is affected with
any injurious fungus, insect or other pest.
A.
All persons, including businesses, utilities and government agencies,
are subject to the provisions of the Natural Resources Article, Title
5, Subtitle 4, of the Annotated Code of Maryland and must obtain a
permit from the Department to remove, prune, root prune or treat in
any way trees and shrubs existing in the right-of-way of any street,
alley or avenue within the Town. The Department shall notify the Tree
Commission of any request for removal of a roadside tree received by
the Department. The Town may remove a tree without a permit from the
Department if the tree is uprooted or determined to be an immediate
danger to persons or property. The Town shall notify the Department of
the action within 24 hours of the removal.

written approval of the Commission. As used in this section, "topping"
means the cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in
diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove the
normal canopy and disfigure the tree.

other obstructions. Prior to granting any such approval, the Town shall
obtain a recommendation from the Tree Commission. In emergency
situations, immediate authorization to top may be given by the Town
Manager.

All roadside trees within the right-of-way of Maryland Route 30, within
the Town limits, which are removed shall have the stumps ground

A public service company which desires to prune, root prune, remove
or treat a roadside tree in any way must obtain a permit from the
State Department of Natural Resources for the desired treatment. Any
treatment of a roadside tree, except removal, must be performed by a
tree expert licensed by the Department.
B.
The Town must obtain a permit from the Department to remove, prune,
root prune or treat a roadside tree. Such treatment, except removals,
must be performed by a licensed tree expert unless the work done
by Town crews is supervised by the Department's Forestry Division
in accordance with its schedule of charges. The Town may obtain
conditional permits to perform limited work on roadside trees by its
employees if said employees are trained to perform the work and
supervised by a Town employee who has passed the tree expert exam
administered by the Department and agrees to be responsible for the
quality of work performed. The designated Town supervisor is not
required to have the necessary three years' experience to obtain a tree
expert's license but must exhibit the ability to cause the trimming to
be done to accepted standards. Supervision of tree trimming will be
limited to roadside trees within the Town and trees on Town-owned

multifamily, commercial or industrial property shall be part of an approved
site plan pursuant to Chapter 135 of the Hampstead Town Code. Where a

exercise of any such legal authority but does not authorize the towing
of any vehicle.

to park that vehicle in violation of meter regulations between the hours of

the streets designated as parking meter zones.
§ 127-28. Meter operation.
On streets or in municipal parking lots designated as meter zones, the
proper officers shall designate parking spaces on the curb or pavements
or by other appropriate means and in each space so marked shall erect or
cause to be erected a parking meter which, upon the deposit of a coin or
combination of coins of the United States indicated on the parking meter,

and maximum parking time limits shall be set from time to time by the
Council. If the vehicle shall remain parked in any parking space for any
length of time so that the meter shall indicate by a proper signal that the
lawful parking period has expired, the vehicle and its operator shall be
considered as parking overtime, and the parking of a vehicle overtime shall
be a violation of this article.
§ 127-30. Violations and penalties.

Main Extensions
§ 132-12. Water supply in developments. [Amended 5-19-1986 by
Ord. No. 205; 6-17-1991 by Ord. No. 224; 6-27-1995 by Ord. No.
271; 7-14-2009 by Ord. No. 466]
Prior to approving a development where the estimated consumption
upon completion is equal to or greater than 5,000 gallons per day
and/or the size of the site developed is equal to or greater than 10
acres, the Town shall require the developer to furnish a water supply to
deliver a water production well or wells that can produce 375 gallons
of permitted water capacity per day for each equivalent dwelling unit
(EDU). For the purpose of this chapter, an equivalent dwelling unit
(EDU) shall represent an annual average demand of 250 gallons of
water per day. Conveyance of any well shall include a wellhead buffer
area as determined by the Town and any such easements or rights-ofway
as may be required for connection of the well to the municipal
water system and vehicular ingress and egress to the well. The
developer shall drill and test the well(s) under the supervision of the
Town or its agent. This testing is to develop data as to the dependable
yield and quality of the source. Such testing will be done in compliance
with all local, state and federal laws and regulations, including all
rules promulgated by the Maryland Department of the Environment
for the testing of municipal water production wells. The Town will
not accept a well for this requirement that produces less than 40
gallons per minute as certified in a groundwater appropriation permit
granted to the Town by the Maryland Department of the Environment.
Where possible, any new well or wells shall be located no closer than
1,000 feet from any existing or planned municipal production well. The
developer shall provide three-phase electric service to the site with
sufficient amperage to supply the well and pumphouse. The Town will
not accept a well for this requirement unless the well's quality has been
tested by a certified laboratory and no contaminant exceeds current
Safe Drinking Water Act maximum contaminant levels for inorganic
chemicals, volatile organic compounds and turbidity. The well shall
be tested within 180 days prior to preliminary development approval
and 180 days prior to final development approval by the Town of
Hampstead.
A.
When a well meeting the above requirements cannot be located, the
developer may apply to the Town Council for a waiver. If a waiver is
approved, the developer shall be assessed a water replacement fee
in the amount of $2,250 for each equivalent dwelling unit (EDU);
provided, however, that the Town has the needed capacity in the
existing water system, as determined by the Town. This fee shall be
payable prior to issuance of a building permit.
B.
Before any waiver may be granted, a developer must make a good faith
effort to provide a water production well or wells. For the purpose of
C.

The owner or owners applying for a water main extension shall be
responsible for the cost of making such an extension. Title to the main shall
remain the sole property of the Town, and shall not be trespassed upon
or interfered with in any respect. This property shall be maintained by the
Town and may be used as the Town deems fit.
§ 132-14. Plans for construction of water facilities.
When water facilities are to be constructed, the owner will furnish plans
for review by the Town and all other agencies having jurisdiction. These
plans will denote location, profile and any other pertinent details required
by agencies having jurisdiction.
§ 132-15. Public works agreement.
Before an extension of a main is made, the owner or applicant shall
complete a public works agreement. Any surplus security will be returned
to the owner. Any deficit will be billed to the owner upon final accounting.
§ 132-16. Reimbursement and buy-back agreements.
The Town will not be required to make any reimbursement to the owner
for additional connections to such mains or enter into any type of buy-back
agreement.
this section, good faith effort shall include but is not limited to the
drilling and testing of exploratory wells in locations determined by the
Town.
In residential developments, each single-family dwelling unit shall
equal one equivalent dwelling unit (EDU). In multifamily developments,
each dwelling unit shall equal .75 of an equivalent dwelling unit (EDU).
D.
In any commercial, industrial or institutional development, the
potential consumption shall be determined by a certified engineer
selected by the Town. The developer shall be required to pay all costs
associated with such determination. The total potential demand shall
be estimated and converted into equivalent dwellings units (EDUs)
by dividing 250 gallons per day into the total estimated daily usage.
Where the Town determines demand cannot be accurately estimated,
the water replacement fee shall be based on a formula of three EDUs
per gross developed acre for commercial developments and 3.5 EDUs
per gross developed acre for industrial developments.
E.
In developments where the projected use is less than 5,000 gallons
per day and/or the size of the site developed is less than 10 acres,
the developer is not required to furnish a water source; however,
the developer shall pay a water replacement fee of $2,250 for each
equivalent dwelling unit.

as ordinary wear and tear are concerned, but the owners will be held
responsible for damages as a result of freezing, hot water or other external
causes, when such damage results directly or indirectly from the negligence
of the customer. When such damage occurs, the Town will furnish and set
another meter to replace the one frozen or otherwise damaged, and the cost
of such repairs, including replaced parts, labor and transportation charges,
shall be paid for by the owner.
§ 132-20. Check or relief valve.
Any owner may be required to install a suitable check valve and relief valve
in the service line on the outlet side of the meter, in such a manner as to
prevent the return of hot water to the meter, and any such owner shall pay
the cost of all repairs necessitated by failure to do so.
§ 132-21. Determination of quantity of water used.
The quantity recorded by the meter shall be taken to be the amount of water
passing through the meter, which amount shall be accepted as conclusive
by both the owner and the Town, except when the meter has been found
to be registering inaccurately or has ceased to register. In such cases, the
quantity may be determined by the average registration of the meter in a
corresponding past period when in order or by the average registration of
the new meter, whichever method is representative, in the opinion of the
Town, of the conditions existing during the period in question.

involving the question of accuracy of the meter, such meter will be tested
upon the written request of the applicant. A meter-testing firm selected by
the Town shall conduct the test.
§ 132-23. Costs of replacement.
If a meter is found to be inaccurate, it shall be replaced at Town expense.
However, if a meter is found to be accurate, the owner will bear all costs of
replacement and related expense.
§ 132-24. Removal, inspection and tampering.
The owner shall permit no one, except an agent of the Town or person
otherwise lawfully authorized to do so, to remove, inspect or tamper with
the meter or other property of the Town located on his premises. The
customer shall notify the Town, as soon as it comes to his knowledge, of any
injury to or cessation in the registration of the meter.

The Main Street Revitalization Area has been established in the Town
of Hampstead Main Street Revitalization Plan adopted on February 8,
2000. A map of the Revitalization Area is hereby made and declared a
part of this chapter as set forth in § 135-5 of the Town Code.
A.
Within the Main Street Revitalization Area, the Hampstead Planning
and Zoning Commission shall provide design review.
A review is required for those projects that involve a substantial
change in the appearance of a building or structure or the
landscape and where approval of a site plan or site plan
amendment is required. A review is also required for the demolition
of a building or structure and relocating a building or structure.
(1)
Review shall include any elements of a formal site plan deemed
necessary by the Commission including, but not limited to,
landscaping, site design, exterior illumination, signage, off-street
parking, architectural elevations and exterior building materials.
(2)
B.
The review procedure seeks to encourage rehabilitation and new
construction in a manner that will promote visual harmony, enhance
the historical integrity and develop creative design solutions. While
the design guidelines will not dictate architectural styles, they will
suggest a variety of design options for achieving compatibility within
the Revitalization Area.
A preapplication conference is recommended prior to conducting
work within the Main Street Revitalization Area. Applicants should
call or visit the Zoning Administrator prior to making application
to discuss proposed design changes and to determine what level of
information is required for submittals.
(1)
An application shall be obtained from the Zoning Administrator.
When completed, the application, required drawings, and
specifications shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator to begin
the review process. Applicants are encouraged to review the
adopted Main Street Revitalization Plan.
(2)
No fees are charged for the Main Street design review and
approval process except for any of those fees associated with site
plan review and approval, where applicable.
(3)
When the project would require a formal site plan in accordance
with Chapter 135, the site plan and design documents, including
architectural elevations shall be submitted and reviewed
concurrently.

Any building, structure or premises lawfully existing at the time of the
adoption of this chapter, or lawfully existing at the time that this chapter
is subsequently amended where such amendment created the specific
nonconformity with this chapter, may continue to be used even though
such building, structure or premises does not conform to use, dimensional
regulations or other requirements of the zoning district in which it is
located, subject to the provisions of this chapter.
When the project does not require a site plan, the Commission shall
review the application and may meet with the applicant at the site
of the proposed work, within 45 days of receipt of the application.

conformance with the requirements of the zoning district in which
it is located.
Upon application, the Board of Zoning Appeals ("the Board") may
approve the structural alteration of a building or structure or the
use of a parcel, lot or tract of land which is not in conformance

building, structure or premises may, with approval of the Board, be
changed to another nonconforming use which, in the opinion of the
Board, is of the same or a more appropriate use or classification.
(4)
Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more
appropriate use in the opinion of the Board, such use shall not
thereafter be changed to a less appropriate use or classification.
(5)
Repairs or improvements to public order or statutory requirement.
[Amended 5-8-2018 by Ord. No. 525]

whether the nonconforming use has ceased for six months. However,
time spent on repairs or improvements pursuant to the requirements,
as detailed in § 135-13B, may be excluded from the time calculation
upon showing to the Zoning Administrator the nature of the work and

Purpose. The purpose of this section of the Town's Zoning Ordinance
is to support the keeping of companion animals in residential areas

breeding and/or sale of farm animals and exotic animals. In broad
terms, companion animalsin reasonable numberare permitted in all
residential districts. The keeping of farm animals is limited to areas
where agricultural activity is allowed. The keeping of exotic
animalsexcept in limited and specific situationsis prohibited.

such as hamsters or gerbils kept in cages shall not count against
this total.

property is three.
(3)
The maximum number of cats permitted on any residential
property is three.
(4)
B.
Farm animals. Keeping, harboring, breeding or possession of farm
animals is permitted in any zoning district where agricultural activity
is allowed, subject to the setback requirements in § 135-20 and all
local, county, state and federal laws, except as follows. [Amended
5-12-2011 by Ord. No. 488]

zoning district where:
The principal permitted use is a detached single-family
dwelling on a lot of one acre or more in size.

enclosure at all times and shall not be allowed to run free.
(e)

(g)
The hen house must be kept in a clean, dry and sanitary
condition at all times.

[Added 3-12-2002 by Ord. No. 353]
§ 135-90. Purpose.
The Residential Office District is intended to provide areas for residential
uses and professional and administrative offices. The purpose of the district
is to preserve and enhance the residential character of the locality involved,
while allowing office uses whose nature is highly compatible with singlefamily
dwellings (e.g., low traffic generation, similar scale, and similar
intensity). Within the Main Street Revitalization Area, the district protects
the essential residential element of downtown Hampstead while offering
increased reuse opportunities for existing dwellings.
§ 135-91. Building character.
Any addition or alterations to the exterior of an existing or former residence
shall not alter the residential character of the building. Any building,
renovation or addition shall be consistent with the architecture,
construction and materials of neighboring structures. Within the Main
Street Revitalization Area, the architecture, construction and materials
shall be consistent with the design guidelines in the Main Street
Revitalization Plan. Any new building shall be residential in design and
appearance.
§ 135-92. Business character.
The business shall be carried on entirely within the principal building.
The business shall not substantially injure the value of adjoining property
and shall be in harmony with the surrounding land uses. The business
shall not materially endanger the public health and safety, or constitute a
public nuisance. The business shall not cause any noise, odors, effluent,
smoke, dust, vibrations, electrical interference, bright or flashing light, or
other objectionable conditions detectable at or beyond the lot line. The
business shall be consistent with the purpose of the district, with the
Town's Comprehensive Plan, and with the Main Street Revitalization Plan,
if located in the Revitalization Area. No sale of goods on the premises is
allowed except for sales which are incidental to the provision of services.
§ 135-93. Parking and traffic.
Off-street parking shall be restricted to the rear or side yard of the
lot, unless otherwise permitted by the Commission. Within the
Revitalization Area, reasonable and appropriate off-street parking
requirements shall be determined by the Commission during the site
plan process and shall be based on the parking needs of the proposed
use, the availability of on-street or off-street parking in the vicinity of
the proposed use and congruence with the Main Street Revitalization

Commission shall have the authority to determine appropriate setbacks in
the site plan approval process. New principal structures shall not exceed 45
feet in height, and no new accessory structure shall exceed 1 1/2 stories or
25 feet in height, except as provided in § 135-258.

by the Town without an approved site plan that conforms to the standards
in the Town Code.

clients' vehicles in numbers or frequency over and above the normal
traffic associated with the dwelling as a residence.

§ 135-130. Purpose. [Amended 4-8-2008 by Ord. No. 444]
§ 135-131. Applicable regulations.
The following regulations and applicable regulations contained in other
articles shall apply in the I-R Restricted Industrial District.
§ 135-132. Principal permitted uses.
Principal permitted uses shall be as follows:
The Restricted Industrial (I-R) District is established to provide areas
for light industrial uses, particularly uses that offer a wide range of
employment opportunities. This district is designed to have high
performance standards and to accommodate uses that can be located
in close proximity to commercial uses, and in locations convenient
to residential areas without creating nuisances or overburdening
infrastructure. The performance standards of the IR district reflect the
Town's commitment to stewardship of the natural environment and
to sustainable development. This includes industrial development that
affords local residents the opportunity to work close to home. The
standards also reflect the increasing scarcity of groundwater in the
Piedmont Plateau.
A.
The district regulations are designed to permit the operations of most
offices, research, manufacturing and "flex space" activities. The intent
of the regulations is to respect the broad authority of the Planning
and Zoning Commission under state law to determine the design,
architecture and site layout of a development to ensure that the
industrial uses in the district do not deleteriously effect other uses
within the district, adjoining property owners, the community or the
environment. The IR district is meant for industrial, not commercial,
uses. Some incidental commercial or retail uses are permitted that
service the industrial uses within the industrial area or that do not
depend upon intensive visits by customers from outside the industrial
area.
B.
Business offices of all types: professional, corporate, government and
nonprofit.
A.
B. Biomedical technology facilities and laboratories.

(2)
(3) Wiring to light poles and standards must be underground.
Building facades may be illuminated with soft lighting of low
intensity that does not draw inordinate attention to the building.
The light source for the building facade illumination must be
concealed.
(4)
Building entrances may be illuminated using recessed lighting in
overhangs and soffits, or by use of spotlighting focused on the
building entrances with the light source concealed (e.g., in
landscaped areas). Direct lighting of limited exterior building areas
is permitted when necessary for security purposes.
(5)
Buffering of adjacent uses.
The development must provide for the buffering of adjacent uses
where there is a transition from one type of use to another use and
for the screening of mechanical equipment and service and storage
areas. The buffer may be provided by distance, landscaping,
fencing, changes in grade, and/or a combination of these or other
techniques.
(1)
Buffering must be designed to provide a year-round visual screen
in order to minimize adverse impacts. It may consist of fencing,
evergreens, berms, rocks, boulders, mounds, or a combination
thereof.
(2)
A development must provide sufficient buffering when
topographical or other barriers do not provide reasonable
screening and where there is a need to buffer the activities of the
planned use from adjoining properties.
(3)
The width of the buffer may vary depending on the nature of the
area. Within densely built-up areas, a buffer with dense plantings,
fencing, or changes in grade may be five feet to 10 feet in width. A
buffer with moderate levels of planting should be 10 feet to 15 feet
in width. In suburban and rural settings, the width of the vegetated
buffer should be increased to a minimum of 25 feet. Areas adjacent
to service, loading, or storage areas should be screened by dense
planting, berms, fencing, or a combination thereof.
(4)
B.
Storage of materials. Exposed nonresidential storage areas, exposed
machinery, and areas used for the storage must have sufficient setbacks
and screening (such as an opaque fence or a dense evergreen hedge) to
C.
§ 135-139 HAMPSTEAD CODE § 135-139
134:318
provide a visual buffer sufficient to minimize their impact on abutting
uses and users of public streets.
Collection receptacles. All dumpsters or similar large collection
receptacles for trash, recyclables or other waste materials must be
located on level surfaces which are paved or a durable and dustfree
surface as approved by the Commission. Where the dumpster or
receptacle is located in a yard which abuts a residential or institutional
use or a public street, it must be screened by fencing or landscaping.
D.
Landscaping. Landscaping must be provided in accordance with the
Carroll County Landscape Manual. The site design should include an
emphasis on native Maryland species and drought-resistant plants.
Irrigation or watering systems should use only recycled water or
rainwater collected on site. The Commission may require any industrial
development to submit a water conservation plan as part of the site
plan approval process.
E.
Building placement.
The site design should avoid creating a building surrounded by
a parking lot. In urban areas, buildings should be placed close
to the street, in conformance with existing adjacent setbacks. In
undeveloped areas, buildings should be set well back from the road
so as to conform with the small-town character of the area.
(1)
Where two or more buildings are proposed, the buildings should be
grouped and linked with sidewalks; tree planting should be used to
provide shade and break up the scale of the site. Plantings should
be provided along the building edge, particularly where building
facades consist of long or unbroken walls.
(2)
F.
Building entrances.
The main entrance to the building should be oriented to the street
unless the parking layout or the grouping of the buildings justifies
another approach, and should be clearly identified as such through
building and site design, landscaping, and/or signage.
(1)
At building entrance areas and dropoff areas, site furnishings such
as benches and sitting walls and, if appropriate, bicycle racks shall
be encouraged. Additional plantings may be desirable at these
points to identify the building entrance and to complement the
pedestrian activity at this point.
(2)
G.
Sidewalks. Where an existing or planned public sidewalk is interrupted
by a proposed project driveway, the sidewalk material must continue to
be maintained across the driveway, or the driveway must be painted to
distinguish it as a sidewalk. Further, if street trees exist on an adjacent
property, street trees must be planted, in a like manner, on the new site.
H.
I. Parking.
§ 135-139 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES § 135-139
134:319
§ 135-140. (Reserved)
Where possible, parking lots should be located to the side or rear of
the building. Parking areas should be separated from the building
by a minimum of five to 10 feet. The use of shared parking, shared
driveways and the cross-connection of parking lots is encouraged.
(1)
If the parking is in front, a generous landscaped buffer between
road and parking lot is to be provided. Unused areas should be kept
natural, as field, forest, wetland, etc.
(2)
Landscaping around and within parking lots shades hot surfaces
and visually "softens" the hard surface look of parking areas.
Parking areas must be designed and landscaped to create a
pedestrian-friendly environment. A landscaped border should be
created around parking lots. Any parking lot containing 10 or more
parking spaces must include one or more landscaped islands within
the interior of the lot. There must be at least one island for every 20
spaces. Landscaping must screen the parking area from adjacent
residential uses and from the street.
(3)
Landscaped roadside buffers.
Whenever the area between the street and the front of the building
is used for parking or vehicle movement, a vegetated buffer strip
must be established along the edge of the road right-of-way. This
buffer strip must soften the appearance of the site from the road
and must create defined points of access to and egress from the
site.
(1)
The Commission may also require a landscaped buffer between the
street and sidewalk in cases where the building fronts on the public
street to create an appropriate pedestrian-friendly environment.
(2)
J.
Building orientation. New buildings within a developed area should be
compatible with the neighborhood such that they reflect the overall
building bulk, square footage, dimensions, placement of the building on
the lot and rhythm of buildings and spaces along the street edge and
minimize the visual impact on the neighborhood. The visual impact of
a building shall be measured by its relationship to other buildings on
the lot, design of the front of the building, and the rhythm of buildings
and open spaces along the street. The design of buildings fronting on a
public street(s) shall be oriented to the street(s).
K.
Building scale. When large new buildings or structures are proposed
in built-up areas where their scale (size) and other features may be
significantly different from that which already exists in the immediate
neighborhood, care must be taken to design the new building or
structure so that it is compatible with its neighbors. This may include
making the building appear small, using traditional materials, styles
and/or proportions.

ARTICLE XVI
Resource Protection Overlay Zone
[Added 10-14-2003 by Ord. No. 376]
§ 135-151. Purpose.
§ 135-152. Delineation of Overlay Zone.
The purpose of the Resource Protection Overlay Zone is to provide for
the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened animal
species and wildlife and fisheries habitat by preventing development
that would disrupt significant species and/or habitat and ensuring the
design of nearby development is done in such a manner as not to
degrade significant species and/or habitat.
A.
Of principal concern is the identified habitat area for the state and
federally listed bog turtle. With regard to the bog turtle, the goal of
this article is to protect, maintain, restore and improve the hydrological
and ecological conditions of the wetlands in which the bog turtle lives.
The hydrology of the bog turtle habitat is sustained by groundwater
and surface water flows. This article is designed to regulate future
land use within the wetlands watershed to prevent negative hydrologic
impacts to the bog turtle habitat and to identify and preserve migratory
corridors for the species. This article also delineates areas where
development may occur in compliance with performance standards and
where such development does not materially harm the bog turtle or its
habitat.
B.
The Resource Protection Overlay Zone applies to any area mapped
by the Maryland Department of Environment, Maryland Department
of Natural Resources or United States Fish and Wildlife Service as
habitat for any species appearing on the official state or federal list
of endangered or threatened species. The Resource Protection Overlay
Zone shall include a minimum buffer area of 300 feet around any
defined habitat area. In the case of the bog turtle species, the Overlay
Zone shall extend to the limits of the topographic surface watershed
of the identified bog turtle habitat as delineated in the Bog Turtle
Resource Protection Overlay Zone Map kept on file in the Hampstead
Town Offices.
A.
The Overlay Zone is subdivided into four separate zones as follows:
Zone 1. This zone is defined as the wetlands which the bog turtle
is known to inhabit, and those wetlands they are likely to inhabit
as shown on the Bog Turtle Resource Protection Overlay Zone
Map. The specific boundary of Zone 1 is defined in the field
by determining the wetland boundary using the 1987 Corps of
Engineers Wetland identification and Delineation Manual.
(1)
B.
§ 135-151 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES § 135-152
134:327
§ 135-153. Application to other zoning districts.
The Resource Protection Overlay Zone shall overlay the existing zoning
districts created by the Zoning Ordinance and its terms and conditions
shall supersede any requirements of said underlying districts, unless the
underlying requirements are more restrictive than those set forth here, in
which case the more restrictive shall govern.
§ 135-154. Compliance with natural resource management plans.
Any permitted or exceptional uses within the Resource Protection Overlay
Zone shall comply with all adopted federal, state or local natural resource
management plans.
§ 135-155. Requirement for exceptional use permit.
All new structures and changes of use extending into the Resource
Protection Overlay Zone shall require an exceptional use permit except as
otherwise permitted in this chapter. If an exceptional use permit is required,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall not approve any preliminary or
final subdivision, site plan or change of use for any property that extends
into a Resource Protection Overlay Zone until such permit has been
granted.
§ 135-156. Process for exceptional use permit.
Zone 2. This zone is defined as a three-hundred-foot zone measured
horizontally from the Zone 1 boundary or the topographic boundary
of the watershed, whichever is less.
(2)
Zone 3. This zone includes the channel of all tributaries flowing
into the Zone I wetlands, including intermittent streams as shown
on the Bog Turtle Resource Protection Overlay Zone Map, located
outside of Zones 1 and 2. Zone 3 also includes a one-hundred-fiftyfoot
buffer zone measured horizontally from the top of all perennial
stream channel banks and in all directions from the headwaters of
such tributaries or to the topographic boundary of the watershed,
whichever is less and a one-hundred-foot buffer zone measured
horizontally from the top of all intermittent stream channel banks
and in all directions from the headwaters of such tributaries or to
the topographic boundary of the watershed, whichever is less. Zone
3 also includes all vegetated wetlands located in the watershed
but not in Zone 1 or 2. The specific boundaries of these wetlands
are defined in the field by determining the wetland boundary using
the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetland Identification and Delineation
Manual.
(3)
Zone 4. This zone is defined as those portions of the topographic
surface watershed which are not included in Zones 1, 2 or 3. Within
Zone 4, surface and groundwater are presumed to flow into the
identified bog turtle habitat.
(4)
§ 135-152 HAMPSTEAD CODE § 135-156
134:328
Upon the approval of a concept subdivision or site plan where the area
of disturbance or where any change of use extends into Zones 1, 2 or
3, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall begin a formal review
of the probable effects of the proposed structure or change in use
on significant habitat and species. In determining whether an adverse
impact will occur, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consult
with representatives of the Maryland Department of Environment,
Maryland Department of Natural Resources and United States Fish and
Wildlife Service and any other such agencies as deemed appropriate by
the Commission.
A.
Where a new structure or change of use is proposed within Zone 4
the Planning and Zoning Commission may require an exceptional use
permit.
In determining whether an exceptional use permit shall be
required, the Commission shall consider:
The size, intensity and type of proposed new structures or
changes in use including the amount of impervious surface.
(a)
The cumulative effect of new structures or changes in use
within the Overlay Zone.
(b)
Specific elements of proposed new structures or changes in
use which present a risk to surface or groundwater including
but not limited to storage and/or use of hazardous materials,
fuels, volatile organic compounds or other such materials.
(c)
The ability of stormwater best management practices as
described in § 135-157 to mitigate the hydrological impact
from proposed new structures or changes in use.40
(d)
(1)
If the Commission determines an exceptional use permit is
required, the applicant for subdivision or site plan approval or
change of use shall comply with the process defined in § 135-156C.
(2)
B.
Biological survey.
As part of the preliminary subdivision or site plan process or
change of use, the Commission shall require a biological survey.
The survey shall be prepared by a qualified biologist approved
by the Commission. Report preparation shall be at the applicants
expense. The biological survey shall contain the following
elements:
A location map and site plan showing topography and all
existing and proposed structures and roads, and the proposed
project site or sites;
(a)
(1)
C.

assessment or survey.
(c)
(d) A map of the environmentally sensitive species and/or habitat.
A description and assessment of potential impacts of the
proposed development on the species and/or habitat;
(e)
A recommendation of mitigation measures which will reduce
those impacts;
(f)
A recommendation of whether the Commission should find
that the concept subdivision, site plan or change of use as
submitted will result in a material adverse impact to the
habitat or species for which the Resource Protection Overlay
Zone was established.
(g)
If mitigation measures are recommended, an assessment of
whether such mitigation measures will reduce the impact from
the proposed subdivision, site plan or change of use to a level
where the impact on the species or habitat is not materially
adverse.
(h)
The biological survey will be submitted to the Commission within
90 days of submission of the preliminary site, subdivision plan or
change of use. Copies of the biological survey and the preliminary
site or subdivision plan shall be provided to the Maryland
Department of Environment, Maryland Department of Natural
Resources and United States Fish and Wildlife Service and any
other such agencies as deemed appropriate by the Commission to
allow for comment. Within not less than 45 days or not more than
90 days of the issuance of the biological survey, the Commission
shall convene a meeting to allow public comment on the biological
survey and to approve or deny the exceptional use permit. All
consulted agencies shall receive written notice of the meeting and
the meeting shall be advertised at least once in a newspaper of
general circulation for the area.
(2)
An exceptional use permit may be granted by the Commission only
where the Commission finds that the probable effect of the new
structure or change in use will not result in a material adverse impact
on the habitat or species for which the Resource Protection Overlay
Zone was established. The Commission shall consider making
compliance with any recommendations made by commenting agencies
and/or any recommendation found in the biological survey a condition
of approval for any site plan, subdivision or change of use.
D.
§ 135-156 HAMPSTEAD CODE § 135-157
134:330
In considering approval of an exceptional use permit, the Commission
shall consider the following general performance standards:
Removal of indigenous vegetation and land disturbance, such as
grading, excavation, paving, and fill, in or within the Overlay Zone
shall be limited to that necessary for the structural improvements
and access. Modifications to the proposal shall be made for siting,
location, design, bulk, vegetation removal, and grading where such
modifications are necessary to prevent a materially adverse impact
on the species and/or habitat.
(1)
Where feasible, the development will use native species consistent
with and found in the Overlay Zone.
(2)
Any commercial or industrial development within the Overlay Zone
will require an integrated pest management plan minimizing the
use of herbicides and pesticides.
(3)
A.
The following specific performance standards shall apply to the zones
within the Overlay Zone:
No work shall be allowed in Zone 1 that will result in any shortterm
or long-term adverse impacts to the local population of the
bog turtle.
(1)
No work shall be allowed in Zone 2 that will result in any shortterm
or long-term adverse impacts to the local population of the
bog turtle. Work within Zone 2 should be generally limited to
those specific activities which are part of a bog turtle management,
habitat enhancement or restoration plan with following additions:
Normal maintenance of land in commercial agriculture without
enlargement as to the geographic extent of the commercial
agricultural activity.
(a)

ARTICLE XXVI
Planned Industrial Development
[Added 2-8-2011 by Ord. No. 487]
§ 135-228. Planned Industrial Developments.
Purpose.
A Planned Industrial Development is intended to allow flexible site
planning and building arrangements for industrial development
under a single plan so that innovative land-planning methods may
be utilized which create campus-like environments, foster natural
resource conservation and reduce traffic congestion. A PID is not
intended to encourage greater density of development but rather
to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land-planning
techniques which result in industrial development patterns that
conserve and create open space, reduce vehicle trips and provide
quality developments which enhance the surrounding area. The
goal is to create high quality, integrated industrial parks that fit
seamlessly within the community, are consistent with the adopted
Community Comprehensive Plan and which allow developers
considerably more flexibility than traditional site plan and
subdivision regulations.
(1)
A PID may be established in any industrial zoning district. These
regulations are designed to achieve the following objectives:
To permit a mixture of light industrial land uses in a master
planned environment that may not be possible within a
traditional zoning district and through standard subdivision
and site plan processes.
(a)
To provide an avenue for industrial development that utilizes
some privately owned and maintained infrastructure.
(b)
To promote an efficient development pattern that is sensitive to
existing topography, physical and environmental features and
adjoining properties.
(c)
To allow the phased subdivision of a large industrial parcel
in accordance with a master development plan without the
administrative burden of repeating the entire subdivision
application and approval process for every lot.
(d)
(2)
A.
Applicability. The regulations set forth in this chapter shall apply to all
PIDs. All zoning regulations applicable in the underlying zoning district
shall apply to uses within the PID except as noted elsewhere in this
chapter.

in the design and management of such varying types of residential
structures, including one- and two-family units, townhouses and garden
apartments, within the areas designated.
A.
The following objectives are sought in providing for the planned unit
development:
To provide a more attractive and varied living environment than
would be possible through the strict application of R district
requirements.
(1)
To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the
development of land.
(2)
To encourage a more intimate, efficient and aesthetic use of open
space.
(3)
To encourage variety in the physical development patterns of
residential areas.

Land which is zoned properly and which meets the minimum
requirements may be designated by the Commission as suitable for a
planned unit development and may be developed by the owner, if he so
desires, according to the requirements and standards herein.
A.
No land or development project shall be designated as a planned unit
development unless it satisfactorily meets criteria set forth in § 120-9D.
Such criteria shall include but not be limited to present or potential
adequacy of schools and highway access. Designation as a planned unit
development does not guarantee that the plan will be granted future
approvals. The plan must satisfy all applicable state, county and Town
codes at the time of each subsequent approval. [Amended 6-13-1995
by Ord. No. 267; 11-28-1995 by Ord. No. 274; 2-13-2018 by Ord.

B.
Dwelling units may include single-family, two-family or multifamily
structures; based on density requirements, standards described, nature
of adjacent development and compensating features of the
development plan. The Commission may approve places of public
assembly, recreational buildings and accessory buildings if primarily
for use by persons residing with the planned unit development and if
located in a manner not detrimental to adjacent properties.
A.
The sum of the number of dwelling units in multifamily structures shall
not constitute more than 50% of all dwelling units of all types.
B.
The gross density of a planned unit development shall not exceed the
equivalent of four dwelling units per gross acre. Such density shall be
calculated as follows, as applicable to multifamily structures:

shall not include streets, off-street parking areas or utility easements. The
Commission must be furnished satisfactory evidence, as a condition for
approval, that such open space area will be continued and that perpetual
maintenance is provided for in accordance with Chapter 121 of the
Hampstead Town Code.
§ 135-237. Water and sewerage systems.
Prior to accepting for approval a development plan for a planned unit
development, the Commission must be furnished satisfactory evidence that
acceptable community water and sewerage systems will be provided and
approved by the Health Department, as well as by any other agency having
jurisdiction over such matters.

3-20-1989 by Ord. No. 218]
Applications for approval of a planned unit development must be
accompanied by a development plan prepared by a licensed architect,
registered civil engineer, professional landscape architect or other
qualified land planner. The development plan shall be to scale and
contain sufficient information to establish the identity of proposed uses,
grades and approximate dimensions and locations of proposed
structures, streets, parking areas, walkways, easements and property
lines.
A.
After approval of the development plan by the Commission, any
material change therein shall require a resubmission of such plan for
approval.
B.
The approved planned unit development (PUD) shall have an executed
public works agreement (PWA) and have grading permits issued within
one year of the date of final approval or the approval will automatically
expire and the PUD must be resubmitted for final approval. The PUD
will be subject to the regulations in force at the time of resubmission.
C.
Within 100 feet of any other property in an R district, dwellings shall be
of single-family types.
A.
As a condition of approval of a planned unit development in which
multifamily dwellings are proposed, the Commission shall require, over
and above other standards herein, that these uses be so arranged
and distributed and appropriately related to open space, single-family
dwellings and/or semidetached dwellings that higher densities are not
unreasonably and disproportionately concentrated in these locations so
as to concentrate traffic on minor residential streets.

Major Subdivisions in R-120,000 Districts
[Amended 3-15-1993 by Ord. No. 254; 2-12-2008 by Ord. No. 440]
§ 135-251. Approval.
A major subdivision of land for residential purposes in any R-120,000
District may be approved by the Commission as permitted in §§ 135-32E and
135-52D subject to § 135-23 of this chapter and the following provisions.
§ 135-252. Purpose and intent.
The Commission finds that a portion of the police power of the State of
Maryland has been delegated to each county, to be exercised reasonably
in determining the manner and nature of development within each county.
The Maryland General Assembly has given much discretion to the several
counties in making such determinations, relying on the local jurisdiction's
knowledge of local conditions and the needs of its people and communities.
The Maryland General Assembly has further created numerous state
departments and agencies to provide consultation, advice, data and other
similar forms of assistance in the furtherance of establishing comprehensive
policies on which to base local county planning decisions for the general
good and welfare. Development pressures, caused by a myriad of complex
social and economic factors which transcend county lines (i.e., population
shifts, sewer moratoriums, accelerating inflation of land values and other
phenomena), are bringing increasing numbers of families into Carroll
County, necessitating the provision of additional public schools; solid waste
disposal sites; water, sewerage and storm drainage facilities; roads and
associated facilities; police, fire and related emergency-service-type
facilities; primary health care facilities; open space, floodplain management
and sediment control measures; and the increasing need for maintaining a
stable tax base. In recognition of the fundamental difference between the
diverse and unlimited "wants" of a growing community of people, and those
"needs" which are inherently limited (i.e., land, air and water resources),
it is imperative that plans, policies and decisions, insofar as it is humanly
possible, be weighed and ordered; first, in consideration of the fundamental
"needs" and, secondly, in consideration of the priority of "wants" which
ultimately involve the direct or indirect expenditure of limited public funds.
§ 135-253. Conditions of approval.
The following provisions, therefore, are set forth in planning for the
continued orderly development of Carroll County and in the pursuit of
these objectives: In designating a tract(s) or area(s) suitable for a major
subdivision of land for residential purposes in any R-120,000 District, the
Commission shall, pursuant to authority granted by Article 66B of the
Annotated Code of Maryland, the Carroll County Zoning Ordinance and
the Subdivision Regulations of Carroll County, in addition to any other
applicable ordinances or regulations, require that adequate provision(s)
be incorporated in and made a part of any conditions of any approval to
§ 135-251 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES § 135-253
134:381
ensure the integrity and orderly use of the county's natural resources as
would promote the public necessity, health, safety, convenience, general
welfare, environment and the county's financial ability to provide and/or
receive essential community improvements, facilities and/or services. Such
conditions of approval may include and ensure adequate provisions for
such specific on- and off-site facilities and improvements as school sites;
solid waste disposal sites; open space, floodplain management and sediment
control measures; water, sewerage and storm drainage facilities; roads and
associated facilities; and police, fire and related emergency-type facilities,
including consideration for primary health care facilities. Whenever any
one or a combination of the aforesaid facilities and/or improvements is
deemed necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of the duly adopted
Official Master Plan for Carroll County and the authority conveyed by
Article 66B of the Annotated Code of Maryland, the Carroll County Zoning
Ordinance, the Subdivision Regulations of Carroll County or any other
applicable ordinances or regulations and where any one or a combination
of the aforesaid facilities and/or improvements deemed necessary cannot
be provided or assured, then the Commission shall either disapprove or
defer designating those areas in question, in whole or in part, as suitable
for a major subdivision of land for residential purposes until such time
as those specific improvements and/or facilities deemed necessary can be
adequately provided or assured.
