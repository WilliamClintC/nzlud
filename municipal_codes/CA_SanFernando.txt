PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of San Fernando, California. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1957 Code, as supplemented through January 5, 1998, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1957 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Code Attorney, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Wilma Miller, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(Ord. No. 1537, § 8, 10-21-2002)  
Sec. 1-71. - Remedies cumulative.

(f)  Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two-year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a condition that may be abated as a nuisance pursuant to subsection (a) of this section of this Code, the court may order such person to pay treble the costs of the abatement. The recovery of treble the costs of abatement of such nuisances as provided in this section of this Code shall not apply to city efforts to abate violations of the building code pursuant to the Health and Safety Code § 17980.

(e)  If the city council determines that the proposed lien authorized pursuant to subsection (a) of this section of this Code shall become a lien, the body may also cause a notice of lien to be recorded. This lien shall attach upon recordation in the office of the county recorder of the county and shall have the same force, priority, and effect as a judgment lien, not a tax lien. The notice shall, at a minimum, identify the record owner or possessor of the property, set forth the last known address of the record owner or possessor, set forth the date upon which the lien was created against the property, and include a description of the real property subject to the lien and the amount of the lien.

(3)  Transactions in which, as a matter of business practice, the form of a sale is arranged and entered into by the seller and the purchaser as a substitute for or the equivalent of the transportation of the article or the payment of transportation charges on the article from the point of the delivery to some other point.

No sale shall be considered a sale for convenience unless it is of a kind described in subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this definition.

(2)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this definition. 
Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See Flooding. 
Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
Floodplain management regulations means this ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas.

Secs. 50-26150-300. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE VII. - GRAFFITI PREVENTION, PROHIBITION AND REMOVAL 
 
Sec. 50-301. - Purpose and intent. 
The city council finds and declares as follows: 
(1)  Graffiti on public or private property is a condition of blight that not only depreciates the value of property which has been the target of such vandalism, but also depreciates the value of the adjacent and surrounding properties so as to create a negative impact upon the entire community. 
(2)  Graffiti has also been found to be associated with criminal activity and delinquency. It is also a means of identification and intimidation utilized by gangs and its presence may further gang-related activities. The power of graffiti to create fear within the community and blight upon the landscape, devaluing property and detracting from a sense of community enjoyed by the residents of the city goes beyond the cost of clean-up or removal. Not only is graffiti a criminal act of vandalism, but it is also a social crime upon the quality of life and freedom from intimidation that residents desire in their neighborhoods. 
(3)  Acts of graffiti are most-often committed by persons under the age of 18 years using aerosol containers of spray paint or felt-tip markers, or both. These implements of graffiti are frequently stolen from retail stores by minors, and, as such, retail stores that display or sell these implements should be required to take reasonable steps to prevent their theft. 
(4)  California Government Code § 53069.3 authorizes the city, under certain circumstances, to provide for the removal of graffiti and other inscribed materials from private as well as public property. Unless the city causes graffiti to be removed from public and private property, it tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti with the result that the entire neighborhood is affected and becomes a less desirable place in which to be. 
(5)  In the past, the city has appropriated funds for the removal of graffiti from privately owned real or personal property located within the city. While this public service benefits the entire community, it provides no incentive to private property owners to deal directly with the problem and to formulate their own ideas, solutions, and mitigation measures to avoid being victimized time and time again. The perpetual provision of free graffiti removal services is not an effective deterrent to the escalation of graffiti vandalism and is not a cost effective use of public funds. 
(6)  It is the purpose and intent of the city council of this city, through the adoption of this Article, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of vandalism and defacement. Such acts are destructive of the rights and values of private property owners as well as of the entire community. It is the further intent of the city council, through the adoption of this article, to provide notice to all of those who disregard the property rights of others, that the city will strictly enforce the law and seek vigorous prosecution against those persons engaging in the defacement of public or private properties. 
(Ord. No. 1581, § 5, 4-21-2008)  
Sec. 50-302. - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this article, the following words shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section: 
Adhesive label shall mean any so called "bumper sticker", sheet of paper, fabric, or plastic, or other substance with an adhesive backing.

Graffiti shall mean any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, mark, or design that is written, marked, etched, scratched, drawn, painted or engraved on or otherwise glued, posted, or affixed to or on any surface of any public or private real or personal property within the city to the extent that the same was not authorized in advance by the owner or occupant thereof. 
Graffiti implement shall mean an aerosol paint container, a felt tip marker, gum label, paint stick, graffiti stick, etching tool capable of scarring glass, metal, concrete, wood, or any other surface, or adhesive label.

Minor shall mean any person under the age of 18 years. 
Paint stick or graffiti stick shall mean a device containing a solid form of paint, chalk, wax, epoxy, or similar substance capable of being applied to a surface by pressure, and upon application, leaving a mark at least one-eighth of an inch in width. 
Responsible party shall mean any person who owns, possesses, occupies, or otherwise has responsibility for the repair or maintenance of personal or real property on which there exists graffiti. Responsible party shall also include any minor (or parent or guardian of a minor) or other person who causes or permits the application of graffiti or other inscribed material. 
Retrofitting shall mean and include, without limitation, the restoration, modification, or alteration of a structure with new or modified parts, devices, systems, or equipment to remove graffiti, to prevent or inhibit the recurrence of graffiti, or to return the structure to an acceptable, usable, unblemished, unblighted, or original state or condition in compliance with all applicable laws. 
Structure shall mean any structure as defined in the city's building code, and shall include, but not be limited to, buildings, walls, fences, sidewalks, curbs, poles, signs, and cargo/shipping containers.

Sec. 50-303. - Accessibility to graffiti implements. 
(a)  Display requirements. It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person or business engaged in a commercial enterprise to display for sale, trade, loan, or exchange any graffiti implement except in an area from which the public shall be securely precluded from entering without employee assistance. Two such acceptable methods for displaying graffiti implements for sale shall be by containment in (i) a completely enclosed cabinet or other storage device which shall be permanently affixed to a building or structure, and which shall, at all times except during access by authorized representatives, remain securely locked; or (ii) in an enclosed area behind a sales or service counter from which the public is precluded from entry. Nothing herein shall relieve such person or business entity from, at all times, complying with the requirements of the California Penal Code § 594.1(c) by posting signs as described therein. 
(1)  Any person or business engaged in the retail sale of etching cream or aerosol container of paint must display at a conspicuous location a legible sign measuring not less than 12 inches by 12 inches with letters at least one-half inch in height which states: 
"It is unlawful for any person to sell or give to any individual under the age of eighteen years, any etching cream or aerosol container of paint that is capable of defacing property, except as provided in Section 594.1 of the California Penal Code. Any person who maliciously defaces real or personal property is guilty of vandalism which is punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both." 
(b)  Storage requirements. It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person or business engaged in the commercial enterprise of selling, providing, loaning, trading, or exchanging graffiti implements to store any graffiti implement except in either (i) a completely enclosed room which shall, at all times except during access or actual occupancy by the owner or authorized adult representative of the owner, remain securely locked; or (ii) in a completely enclosed cabinet or other storage device which shall be permanently affixed to a building, and which shall at all times except during access by the owner or an authorized adult representative of the owner, remain securely locked. For purpose of this section, an owner or authorized representative of the owner shall be deemed to actually occupy a room even during brief periods of absence if the room is contained within a larger building which is occupied by the owner. 
(c)  Civil responsibility for wrongful display or storage. Any person or business who displays or stores or permits the display or storage of any graffiti implement in violation of the provisions of this section shall be personally liable for any and all costs, including attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by any party in connection with the removal of graffiti, the repair of any property containing graffiti, or such party's prosecution of a civil claim for reimbursement or damages resulting from such graffiti removal or property repair, arising from the use by any person of such wrongfully displayed or stored graffiti implement in violation of this section or of any provision of the California Penal Code. 
(Ord. No. 1581, § 5, 4-21-2008)  
Sec. 50-304. - Graffiti constitutes a nuisance. 
Pursuant to California Government Code § 38771, the city council hereby declares the following conditions to constitute a public nuisance: 
(1)  Graffiti visible from real property (whether privately or publicly owned), public street, sidewalk, alley, or other public right-of-way or other area open to the public; 
(2)  The existence of any surface of a structure, tree, shrub, sidewalk, curb, or vehicle on any privately owned parcel of land which has been defaced with graffiti after removal more than five times in 12 months (hereinafter, "graffiti attracting surface"). 
(Ord. No. 1581, § 5, 4-21-2008)  
Sec. 50-305. - Graffiti removal requirement. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, it shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person to maintain graffiti, that is, to cause, permit, aid, abet, or suffer any graffiti which is visible from any real property (whether privately or publicly owned), public street, sidewalk, alley, or other public right-of-way or other area open to the public to remain on any structure, tree, shrub, or vehicle owned, possessed, or within the custody or control of such person, or located on real property owned, possessed, or within the custody or control of such person. 
(1)  Each day that graffiti is maintained constitutes a new and separate offense, and is subject to the penalties set forth in Chapter 1, Articles II and III of this Code. 
(2)  Enforcement of this section shall be stayed pending a final order upon appeal of a notice of abatement. 
(Ord. No. 1581, § 5, 4-21-2008)  
Sec. 50-306. - Abatement of graffiti by city. 
(a)  The city council authorizes the appropriation and use of public funds for abatement of the public nuisance conditions listed in section 50-304 of this Code, that is, either the removal of the graffiti or other inscribed material from publicly or privately owned real or personal property located within the city, or if the graffiti cannot be removed cost effectively, the repair or replacement of the portion of the property that was defaced, or to otherwise abate graffiti attracting surfaces, and the director of public works, or his or her designee, is authorized to immediately abate the nuisance pursuant to the following conditions: 
(1)  In abating the public nuisance from public property owned or leased by the city, the painting, repair, and/or replacement of an area more extensive than where the graffiti is located shall not be authorized, except where the director of public works, or his or her designee, determines that a more extensive area must be repainted, repaired, and/or replaced. 
(2)  Where the structure or surface is owned by a public entity other than the city, the removal of graffiti by city agents may be performed only after securing the consent of the public entity having jurisdiction over the structure or surface and only after such entity executes an appropriate release and right of entry form permitting such graffiti removal. In abating the public nuisance from a structure or property owned by another public entity, the painting, repair, and/or replacement of an area more extensive than where the graffiti is located shall not be authorized, except where (i) the director of public works, or his or her designee, determines that a more extensive area must be repainted, repaired, and/or replaced in order to avoid aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community; or (ii) the other public entity agrees in writing to pay for the costs of repainting, repairing, and/or replacing a more extensive area. 
(3)  Where the structure or surface is privately owned, the removal of graffiti by city agents may be performed only after securing the consent of the owner or possessor and only after the owner or possessor executes an appropriate written release and right of entry form permitting such graffiti removal. In abating the public nuisance from a structure or property owned by a private party, the painting, repair, and/or replacement of an area more extensive than where the graffiti is located shall not be authorized, except where (i) the director of public works, or his or her designee, determines that a more extensive area must be repainted, repaired, and/or replaced in order to avoid aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community; or (ii) a responsible party agrees in writing to pay for the costs of repainting, repairing, and/or replacing a more extensive area. 
(b)  As an alternative to the procedure provided in the first sentence of subsection (a)(3) of this section, Enforcement Officer(s) shall have the authority to cause the abatement and removal thereof in accordance with the procedure set forth in section 50-307. 
(Ord. No. 1581, § 5, 4-21-2008)  
Sec. 50-307. - Abatement of graffiti by city without consent of property owner or possessor. 
If the consent of the private property owner or possessor of the property cannot be obtained, a public nuisance condition listed in section 50-304 of this Code which is located on privately owned real or personal property within the City may be abated by the city at the owner's expense as a public nuisance pursuant to the following provisions: 
(1)  Notice of abatement. The enforcement officer shall issue a "Notice of Graffiti Nuisance and Intent to Abate by City Agents" (hereinafter, "notice of abatement") to the owner and/or person in possession of the property on which the nuisance exists, or to any other party responsible for the nuisance, requiring the abatement of the nuisance within 72 hours of the date of service of the notice of abatement, or within some other longer reasonable time period in connection with a graffiti attracting surface. 
(2)  Contents of notice of abatement. A notice of abatement issued pursuant to this section shall contain the following provisions: 
a.  The address of the real property on which the nuisance condition exists. 
b.  A brief description of the nuisance condition(s). 
c.  A reference to the law prohibiting or pertaining to the nuisance condition.

e.  A time period and/or schedule in which to complete the nuisance abatement actions (with all required city approvals, permits and inspections, when applicable) pursuant to the time limits proscribed in subsection (a) of this section. 
f.  The period and manner in which a responsible party may contest the notice of abatement pursuant to section 50-307 of this Code. No such right shall exist when the city is not seeking to establish the right to abate a public nuisance with city agents. 
g.  A statement that if the violations are not abated within the time specified or a timely appeal is not made, such nuisance may be abated by city agents, in the manner stated in this notice and that all costs of the abatement shall be assessed against the responsible part(ies) and/or the subject property, as a lien or as a special assessment, at the city's election, in accordance with the nuisance abatement provisions of sections 1-152 through 1-154, 50-307 through 50-308, 106-1152 through 106-1154, or any applicable combination thereof. 
(3)  Service of notice of abatement. A notice of abatement issued pursuant to this section shall be served (i) by personal service on the owner, occupant or person in charge or control of the property; (ii) by posting at a conspicuous place on the property or abutting public right-of-way; or (iii) by sending a copy of the notice by United States mail addressed to the owner or person in charge or control of the property, at the person's mailing address according to the last equalized assessment roll of the Los Angeles County Assessor's Office, or if the owner's address is unknown, then in care of the property address. Service by mail shall be complete at the time of deposit with the U.S. Postal Service, and such service shall be made on the day the notice is dated and by affidavit, the original of which shall be filed with the city clerk. Failure of any responsible party to receive a Notice of Abatement properly addressed pursuant to this subdivision and mailed shall not invalidate any action or proceeding pursuant to this Chapter. 
(4)  Deadline for owner to abate. The owner shall within 72 hours of the date of service of the notice of abatement, or within a longer time period if specified in the notice of abatement, remove the graffiti or be subject to abatement of the graffiti by the City and assessment of the costs of such abatement as a lien or special assessment against the subject property in accordance with the nuisance abatement provisions of sections 1-152 through 1-154, 50-307 through 50-308 or 106-1152 through 106-1154 of this Code, or any applicable combination thereof. The enforcement officer may extend the period of time in which to abate graffiti upon a showing of good cause. 
(5)  Method of abatement. When graffiti is being abated by the repainting of the surface on which the graffiti exists, the responsible party shall use paint that matches the color of the remaining portions of the real or personal property being painted or as otherwise approved by the director of community development, or his or her designee. As it relates to a graffiti attracting surface, a notice of abatement may require, but shall not be limited to, any of the following modifications (or combinations thereof) as methods of abatement the costs of which are to be borne by the responsible part(ies): 
a.  Retrofitting of the graffiti attracting surface; 
b.  Application or use of anti-graffiti materials, or both, to the graffiti attracting surface such as anti-etching films or anti-graffiti paints; 
c.  Installation of landscaping so as to screen or to provide a barrier to the graffiti attracting surface; and, 
d.  Installation of additional lighting. 
Each of the modifications listed in the notice of abatement shall use materials, methods, or designs approved in advance by the director of community development, or his or her designee. 
(6)  Appeal of notice of abatement. 
a.  Right of appeal from a notice of abatement. 
1.  A responsible party may contest a notice of abatement by filing a written request for an appeal with the city clerk within three business days of service of the notice of abatement. A written request for an appeal shall contain the following information: 
(a)  Name, address, and telephone number of each responsible party who is appealing the notice of abatement (hereinafter, "appellant"). 
(b)  Address and description of real property upon which the city intends to enter and abate a public nuisance. 
(c)  Date of notice of abatement being appealed. 
(d)  Specific action or decision being appealed. 
(e)  Grounds for appeal in sufficient detail to enable the hearing officer to understand the nature of the controversy. 
(f)  The signature of at least one appellant. 
2.  Failure of the city clerk to receive a timely appeal constitutes a waiver of the right to contest a notice of abatement. In this event, the notice of abatement is final and binding. 
3.  The provisions of this section only apply to instances where the city has elected to establish the right, but not the obligation, to abate public nuisances with city agents. In no event does this article limit the right of city officials to issue alternative written or oral notices of code violations to responsible persons (as the term "responsible persons" is defined in section 1-52 of this Code), or to cause the abatement of public nuisances in a different manner, including without limitation, by court orders arising from the city's exercise of its criminal or civil remedies. In such instances, a responsible person shall receive a right to hearing and other due process rights in court. 
b.  Appeal hearing. 
1.  Any responsible party who contests a notice of abatement shall, subject to filing a timely appeal, obtain review thereof before a hearing officer, which hearing officer shall be appointed pursuant to section 1-62 of this Code. The city clerk shall schedule the administrative appeal no later than 30 days, and no sooner than seven calendar days, after receipt of a timely filed request for appeal. The appellants listed on the written request for an appeal shall be notified in writing at least five days prior to the date of the hearing by first class mail of the date, time, and location of the hearing. The time in which to abate the nuisance pursuant to the notice of abatement is stayed pending the outcome of the hearing. 
2.  At the place and time set forth in the notification of appeal hearing, the hearing officer shall hear the testimony of the appellant(s), the issuing enforcement officer, and/or their witnesses, as well as any documentary evidence presented by these persons concerning the alleged public nuisance(s). 
3.  Appeal hearings are informal, and formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. The city bears the burden of proof to establish a nuisance exists by a preponderance of evidence. The notice of abatement and any additional reports submitted by the enforcement officer(s) shall constitute prima facie evidence of the facts contained in those documents and such enforcement officer(s) are not required to participate in the appeal hearing. The appellant, and city, as well as all other interested persons, shall have the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. The appellant, or other interested persons, may represent themselves or be represented by anyone of their choice. The appellant, or other interested persons, may bring a language interpreter to the hearing at their sole expense. 
4.  If the appellant(s) fail to attend the scheduled hearing, the hearing will proceed without the appellant(s), and the appellant(s) will be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing. 
c.  Notice of decision; order of abatement. 
1.  Within a reasonable time, not to exceed ten calendar days following conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall make any one or more of the following determinations in a written decision (hereinafter, "order of abatement"):

(b)  The name of each person responsible for a nuisance condition, or conditions, at the subject property, as well as the name of any appellant who lacks responsibility therefor.

(Ord. No. 1581, § 5, 4-21-2008)  
Sec. 50-308. - Costs of abatement. 
The costs of abatement shall be determined pursuant to sections 106-1152 through 106-1153 of this Code; provided, however, in the event that the cost of abatement is being assessed against a graffiti perpetrator, the calculation of the costs of abatement of graffiti shall also include the related administrative costs as provided in section 50-309. The costs of abatement shall constitute a personal obligation against the responsible parties, and may be assessed in any, or a combination, of the following manners: 
(1)  Special assessment or nuisance abatement lien in accordance with the provisions of sections 1-152 through 1-154, or section 106-1154 of this Code; 
(2)  Graffiti abatement lien or special assessment against any parcel of land owned by a minor (or a parent or legal guardian of any minor) or other person creating, causing, or committing a graffiti nuisance, as authorized by section 38772 of the California Government Code and in accordance with section 50-309 of this Code; 
(3)  Any other manner provided in the city's graffiti removal program (in instances where the owner or tenant of a property where a graffiti nuisance exists consents to the removal of the nuisance by city agents); and, 
(4)  Any other manner provided or authorized by law. 
(Ord. No. 1581, § 5, 4-21-2008)  
Sec. 50-309. - Abatement of graffiti by city at graffiti perpetrator's expense. 
(a)  The cost of abatement of graffiti, as well as related administrative costs, shall become a lien against any property owned by any minor or other person creating, causing, or committing the nuisance and shall be a personal obligation of such minor or other person as set forth in Government Code § 38772. The parent or guardian having custody and control of such minor shall be jointly and severally liable with the minor and the expense of abatement of such graffiti shall be a personal obligation and become a lien or an assessment on the property of such parent or guardian. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, the term "related administrative costs" includes, but is not limited to, court costs, attorney's fees, and the law enforcement costs incurred by the city in identifying and apprehending the minor or other person who created, caused, or committed the graffiti or other inscribed material on property of another within the city. 
(b)  Graffiti nuisance abatement lien. 
(1)  The city may collect the costs of abatement of graffiti, as well as related administrative costs, by a graffiti nuisance abatement lien upon the parcel of land owned by the minor or other person who applied graffiti to the property, or upon the parcel of land owned by the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor. 
(2)  If the total costs of abatement of the graffiti and related administrative costs, as determined by the city council pursuant to section 106-1153, are not paid to the city in full within ten days after the date of the notice from the city, the city clerk may record, in the county recorder's office in the county in which the parcel of land is located, a graffiti nuisance abatement lien, which, from the date of recording, shall have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien. 
(3)  Prior to the recordation of the lien, notice of the lien shall be personally served upon the person owning the lot or parcel of land upon which the lien is sought, whether such person may be the minor, other person, or parent of guardian of the minor, in accordance with California Government Code Section 38773.2. The date upon which service is made shall be entered on or affixed to the face of the copy of the notice at the time of service. However, service of such notice without such date shall be valid and effective. 
(4)  The graffiti nuisance abatement lien shall specify the amount of the lien, that the lien is imposed on behalf of the city, the street address, legal description, and assessor's parcel number of the parcel upon which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel. 
(5)  The lien will continue in full force and effect until the entire amount due is paid in full. 
(6)  The graffiti nuisance abatement lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by the city. The city may recover from the parcel owner any costs incurred regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the parcel owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien or as condition of releasing the lien upon payment. 
(7)  If the lien is discharged, released, or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge shall be recorded by the city. A graffiti nuisance abatement lien and the release of the lien shall be indexed in the grantor-grantee index. 
(c)  Special assessment. 
(1)  As an alternative to the procedure set forth in subsection (b) of this section, the city may make the costs of abatement of graffiti, as well as related administrative costs, a special assessment against the parcel of land owned by the minor or other person or by the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor, as provided in Government Code § 38773.6. 
(2)  If the total costs of the abatement of the graffiti and related administrative costs, as determined by the city council pursuant to section 106-1153, are not paid to the city in full within ten days after the date of the notice from the city, the city may cause the total costs of abatement, including related administrative costs, to be charged to the owner of the subject lot or parcel on the next regular tax bill. 
(3)  The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws of the state applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement and related administrative costs relate has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement and related administrative costs shall not result in a lien against the real property but shall instead be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
(4)  Notices or instruments relating to the abatement proceeding or special assessment may be recorded. 
(5)  Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two-year period finding a minor or other person described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of California Government Code Section 38772 is responsible for a condition that may be abated as a nuisance pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the court may order such minor or other person to pay treble the costs of the abatement. 
(Ord. No. 1581, § 5, 4-21-2008)  
Sec. 50-310. - Prevention of graffiti through land use entitlements. 
In approving tentative or parcel maps, subdivision maps, conditional use permits, variances, or other discretionary land use entitlements, the city shall consider imposing conditions reasonably related to the control of graffiti or the mitigation of the impacts of graffiti, or both. Such conditions may include, without limitation, any or all of the following: 
(1)  Installation and use of anti-graffiti materials (as approved by the director of community development, or his or her designee) on surfaces which are likely to be graffiti attracting surfaces;

(6)  Applicant or permittee to supply the city with sufficient matching paint and/or anti-graffiti material on demand for use in the abatement of graffiti by city agents.

In the event of multiple contributors of information, the reward amount shall be divided by the Ccity in the manner it shall deem appropriate. For the purposes of this section, diversion of the offending violator to a community service program, or a plea bargain to a lesser offense, shall constitute a conviction. 
(b)  Claims for rewards under this section shall be filed, in writing, with the city clerk. Each claim shall: 
(1)  Specifically identify the date, location, and kind of property damaged or destroyed, 
(2)  Identify by name the person who was convicted, and, 
(3)  Identify the court and the date upon which the conviction occurred. 
(c)  No claim for a reward shall be allowed by the city council unless the city investigates and verifies the accuracy of the claim and determines that the requirements of this section have been satisfied. The investigation must determine that the claimant's information was relevant and directly responsible for the arrest and conviction of the suspect. 
(d)  Any person committing graffiti vandalism, and if that person is an unemancipated minor, then the parent or lawful guardian of the minor, shall be civilly liable for any reward paid pursuant to this section. 
(Ord. No. 1581, § 5, 4-21-2008)  
Sec. 50-312. - Parental responsibility. 
Pursuant to California Civil Code § 1714.1(b), where graffiti is applied by an unemancipated minor, the parents or legal guardian of the minor shall be jointly and severally liable for payment of civil damages resulting from the misconduct of the minor in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in California Civil Code § 1714.1(b) as it is adjusted periodically by the Judicial Council. The parent or legal guardian of the minor shall also be civilly liable for any reward paid pursuant to section 50-311 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 1581, § 5, 4-21-2008)  
Sec. 50-313. - Penalties. 
(a)  Criminal penalties. Any violation of this chapter shall constitute a misdemeanor offense and subject to the penalties set forth in chapter 1, article II of this Code. 
(b)  Additional penalties. Whenever deemed appropriate, it is the city's intent to petition a sentencing court to impose the following additional penalties or conditions of any grant or probation, diversion, deferred entry of judgment, or other court supervision (including upon a determination that a minor is to be a ward of the court as a result of committing an act of vandalism or graffiti) upon conviction: 
(1)  Suspension or delay in issuance of driver's license (pursuant to California Vehicle Code § 13202.6); 
(2)  Community service and/or graffiti removal service (pursuant to California Penal Code §§ 640.6 and 1203 et seq., Welfare & Institutions Code §§ 728 and 729.8, and Vehicle Code § 42001.7); and, 
(3)  Payment of restitution for the expenses/costs of abatement pursuant to California Penal Code § 1202.4, California Government Code § 38772, or other state law. 
(c)  Cumulative remedies. The remedies provided in this Ordinance are in addition to other remedies and penalties available under provisions of other applicable city ordinances, the laws of the State of California, or the laws of the United States."

The schedule shall also state the amount due for each delinquent customer account for inclusion of said amount upon the property tax roll for collection by the Los Angeles County Assessor's Office. No delinquent billing shall be eligible for submission to the city on or before the 30th calendar day following the issuance of the collector's second past due billing notice. No delinquent billing shall remain eligible for submission to the city after one year from the date the delinquent billing first becomes eligible for submission to the city. 
(4)  In addition to any other requirements set forth under Health and Safety Code Sections 5473 and 5473a, the city shall adhere to the following procedures before submitting delinquent fees and charges to the Los Angeles County Assessor's Office for placement on the tax roll:

Notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the owner of every real property parcel listed on the report not less than ten days prior to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, city shall hear any objections or protests of owners liable to be assessed for delinquent fees or charges. The city may make revisions or corrections to the report as it deems appropriate, after which, by resolution, the report shall be confirmed. 
b.  The delinquent fees and charges set forth in the report as confirmed shall constitute special assessments against the real property parcels listed in the report and are a lien on said real property for the amount of the delinquent fees and charges. A certified copy of the confirmed report shall be filed with the Los Angeles County Assessor's Office for the amounts of the respective assessments against the respective real property parcel as they appear on the current assessment roll. The lien created attaches upon recordation, in the office of the Los Angeles County Recorder, of a certified copy of the resolution of confirmation. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary ad valorem property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for those taxes. 
c.  City shall remit to the collector amounts collected pursuant to this process within 30 days of receipt from the Los Angeles County Assessor, less any outstanding sums owed by the collector to the city. In order to reimburse the city for any and all administrative costs associated with placing delinquent fees and charges on the tax roll and except as otherwise provided in any collection agreement between the city and a collector, the city may deduct from the sums remitted by the Los Angeles County Assessor for a given tax year an amount equal to the lesser of the following: (a) the city's actual costs incurred to undertake the placement delinquent fees and charges on the tax roll, including but not limited to any and all fees or charges imposed by the Los Angeles County Assessor associated with the placement of the delinquent fees or charges on the tax roll as well as costs associated with all publication and noticing efforts; or (b) five percent of the total delinquent sums placed on the tax roll on behalf of an individual collector.

Sec. 78-6. - Merger of parcels. 
(a)  Generally. Whenever two or more contiguous lots, parcels or units of land are held by the same owner, such lots, parcels, or units may be merged where any one of the contiguous lots, parcels, or units held by the same owner does not conform to standards for minimum parcel size under the city zoning ordinance in chapter 106 of this Code and if all of the following requirements are satisfied: 
(1)  At least one of the affected parcels is undeveloped by any structure for which a building permit was issued or for which a building permit was not required at the time of construction or is developed only with an accessory structure or is developed with a single structure, other than an accessory structure, that is also partially sited on a contiguous lot, parcel or unit; and 
(2)  With respect to any affected parcel, one or more of the following conditions exists: 
a.  The parcel comprises less than 5,000 square feet in an area at the time of the determination of merger.

(3)  The owner of the affected parcels has been notified of the merger proposal pursuant to Government Code § 66451.13 and is afforded the opportunity for a hearing pursuant to Government Code § 66451.14. 
(b)  Extent of merger. Merger shall occur even though it does not create a lot conforming to the current standards for minimum lot area and dimensions, but does create a lot which more closely conforms to current standards; if the lots, parcels, or units are developed with a structure, merger shall occur only to those lots, parcels, or units which are developed as a single unit. 
(c)  Treatment of lots after merger. After merger has occurred with respect to any contiguous lots, parcels, or units of land under this section, such lots, parcels, or units of land shall be treated as a single lot under this Code. 
(d)  Contiguity. Property shall be considered as contiguous lots, parcels or units of land only if such lots, parcels or units of land are adjoining, but not if such lots, parcels or units of land are separated by roads, streets, utility easements or railroad rights-of-way. 
(e)  Notice to affected property owners. Whenever the director of planning determines that real property should be merged pursuant to this section, he shall cause to be filed for record with the county recorder, and on the same date mailed by certified mail to the then-current record owner of the property, a notice of intention to determine status, notifying the owner that the affected lots, parcels, or units may be merged pursuant to this section and advising the owner of the opportunity to request a hearing before the planning commission on determination of status and to present evidence at the hearing that the property does not meet the criteria for merger. 
(f)  Review by planning commission. Whenever a property owner objects to the recording of a notice of intention to determine status within 30 days of the recording thereof and requests a hearing before the planning commission, the planning commission shall hold a hearing thereon and allow the property owner to state his objection and present any evidence upon which he relies. The property owner shall be advised in writing of the time, date and place of the hearing. The hearing shall occur not more than 60 days from the receipt of the request therefor, unless postponed or continued by mutual consent of both the city and the property owner. If the planning commission determines that the conditions constituting merger have not occurred, it shall instruct the director of planning not to file a notice of merger, and release of the notice of intention to determine status shall be recorded and a clearance letter mailed to the then-current owner of record. Otherwise, the director shall file the notice of merger unless the decision of the planning commission is appealed within ten days to the city council. 
(g)  Recordation of notice of merger. The merger of parcels as provided in this section shall be effective upon the city's filing for record with the county recorder a notice of merger. The notice of merger shall be filed within 30 days after the conclusion of a hearing held pursuant to subsections (e) and (f) of this section or within 30 days of the date a final decision is made by the city council if the decision of the planning commission, rendered pursuant to subsections (e) and (f) of this section, is appealed.

The land dedication or fee in lieu thereof shall be used for park and recreational purposes. The amount of land to be dedicated shall be three acres per 1,000 residents or a fee in lieu thereof based on the fair market value of three acres of land per 1,000 residents, as determined by appraisal. Such appraisal shall be paid for by the subdivider who shall deposit with the city an amount sufficient to cover the cost of the appraisal. The city shall select an MAI appraiser. The appraisal shall be completed prior to approval of the tentative map by the city. 
(2)  If the subdivider is not satisfied with the values established by the first appraisal, the subdivider may request and shall pay for the preparation of a second appraisal. The subdivider shall deposit with the city an amount sufficient to cover the cost of preparing the second appraisal. The city shall then select a second MAI appraiser to conduct the appraisal. If a second appraisal is conducted, the values established by the two appraisals shall be averaged, and that amount shall be the value used for determining the in-lieu fee. 
(c)  Standards. Standards for dedication of land or payment of a fee for park and recreation purposes shall be as follows: 
(1)  The number of people estimated to reside in a residential subdivision shall be calculated based on 3.5 persons per single-family residence; 1.8 persons per multiple-family unit; or two persons per mobile home. 
(2)  Based on subsection (c)(1) of this section, 457 square feet of land shall be dedicated for each single-family residence; 235 square feet shall be dedicated for each multiple-family unit; and 262 square feet of land shall be dedicated for each mobile home. If a fee in lieu of dedication is required, the fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land prescribed for each unit. 
(3)  Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, partial credit, not to exceed 50 percent, may be given against the requirements of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the city council finds that it is in the public interest to do so and provided that the use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city or its successors.

For the purposes of this article, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

Neither shall the substitution be deemed to have been made in those sections, including but not necessarily limited to sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain gross receipts which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while those gross receipts remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Revenue and Taxation Code §§ 60017176 nor to impose this tax with respect to certain gross receipts which would not be subject to tax by the state under the provisions of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and, in addition, the name of the city shall not be substituted for that of the state in Revenue and Taxation Code §§ 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 and 6828.

Neither shall the substitution be deemed to have been made in those sections, including but not necessarily limited to sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such storage, use or other consumption remains subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Revenue and Taxation Code §§ 60017176, nor to impose this tax with respect to certain storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the provisions of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and, in addition, the name of the city shall not be substituted for that of the state in Revenue and Taxation Code §§ 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 and 6828, as adopted, and the name of the city shall not be substituted for the word "state" in the phrase "retailer engaged in business in this state" in Revenue and Taxation Code § 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Revenue and Taxation Code § 6203.

Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2.  
Sec. 82-107. - Imposition and levy. 
(a)  There is imposed and levied upon every person who pays an admission charge to any place located within the city limits a tax of $0.22 on each admission charge. The tax shall also be levied upon every person who, for promotional or other purposes, is admitted free or at reduced rates. 
(b)  On July 1, 1993, the tax rate established under this section shall automatically increase to $0.25 on each admission charge. On July 1, 1994, the tax rate established under this section shall automatically increase to $0.28 on each admission charge. 
(c)  On July 1 of each year thereafter the then-existing tax rate imposed under this section shall automatically increase by ten percent of the previous year's tax, plus the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside (1982-84 equals 100) as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics ("index"), rounded to the nearest cent. The increases shall be cumulative. In determining the percentage increase, the index for the month of May immediately preceding the adjustment date shall be compared with the index for the like month of the previous year. In no event, however, shall the tax imposed be adjusted downward to reflect a percentage increase in the index. 
(d)  Commencing March 1, 1999, the automatic ten percent increase in the tax rate imposed under subsection (c) shall be suspended; however, the admissions tax shall continue to increase annually based on the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside (1982 1984 equals 100). The city council may terminate the suspension by an ordinance adopted by a majority vote. The city council may subsequently ordain by a majority vote to again suspend the automatic increase, which suspension may be terminated as described in this subsection. If the city council ordains to resume the automatic increase in the admissions tax, the first increase following the resumption shall be by ten percent of the tax rate existing at the time the suspension to be terminated was imposed, rather than by ten percent of the level the admissions tax would have reached had the automatic increase not been suspended. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, the city council may suspend the collection of an admissions tax imposed upon a patron pursuant to this article for up to 30 calendar days per calendar year upon application by and a written agreement with an operator.

(1)  To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and § 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the City of San Fernando (hereinafter, "city") to adopt the ordinance implementing this tax which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

(3)  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the state board of equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the state board of equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes. 
(4)  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this article.

Impacts and recommended mitigation measures identified by the transit operator shall be evaluated in the draft environmental impact report prepared for the project. Related mitigation measures adopted shall be monitored through the mitigation monitoring requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act. 
(b)  Phased development projects, development projects subject to a development agreement, or development projects requiring subsequent approvals need not repeat this process as long as no significant changes are made to the project. It shall remain within the discretion of the lead agency to determine when a project is substantially the same and, therefore, covered by a previously certified environmental impact report. 
(Code 1957, § 13.169)

a.  Not less than ten percent of employee parking area shall be located as close as is practical to the employee entrances, and shall be reserved for use by potential carpool/vanpool vehicles, without displacing handicapped and customer parking needs. This preferential carpool/vanpool parking area shall be identified on the site plan upon application for building permit, to the satisfaction of the city. A statement that preferential carpool/vanpool spaces for employees are available and a description of the method for obtaining such spaces must be included on the required transportation information board.

(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this fee is for sewage treatment; the collected fee shall be used to increase treatment capacity and lines for city residents. There is a direct relationship between the use of the fee and the type of development described above and between the need for the facility and the type of project in that houses and commercial and industrial facilities need sewage treatment. The relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the portion of the facility attributed to the development as described above is set forth in the Wastewater Rate Study dated June 28, 2004 prepared by the public works director which was based on the September 14, 1999 Wastewater Rate Study prepared by Black & Veatch Corporation, Consulting Engineers, and which is on file in the office of the city engineer. 
(c)  Rate adjustment. The fees for sewage treatment are significantly based on fees payable to the City of Los Angeles per the contract between that city and the City of San Fernando. The City of San Fernando portion of capital facilities charges is calculated to be 34.79% above the payable amount due to the City of Los Angeles. Therefore, the Schedule of capital facilities charges for sewer connections detailed in subsection (a) should be adjusted to reflect any annual or other increase in payment due to the City of Los Angeles. This adjustment is independent and may be applied in addition to any other applicable adjustment.

(Code 1957, § 22A.11.1; Ord. No. 1614, § 2, 5-7-2012) 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1614, § 2, adopted May 7, 2012, changed the title of § 94-66 from annual amendment to charges based on consumer price index to annual increase.  
Sec. 94-70. - Due date of charges. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in division 1 of this article or this division, all sewer service and use charges shall be due and payable on the first day of the next succeeding month following the month in which the charges were incurred and shall become delinquent at 5:00 p.m. on the last day of the month. 
(b)  If the billing by the city is bimonthly, such sewer service charges shall become due on the first day of the first month following the bimonthly period for which the charges are billed, and the charges shall become delinquent at 5:00 p.m. on the last day of the month. 
(c)  Payments for such service charges made by the United States mail, where the envelopes containing such payments are properly addressed, bear sufficient postage, and are postmarked at any time prior to 12:00 midnight of the day on which such charges would otherwise become delinquent, shall be accepted as payment before delinquency. If the day on which the payment of charges would otherwise be delinquent falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday, the next full business day thereafter shall be considered as the day on which the delinquency occurs. 
(Code 1957, § 22A.13)  
Sec. 94-71. - Billing. 
Except as otherwise provided in division 1 of this article or this division, the city clerk shall ascertain the amount of each sewer service and use charge applicable to each premises in the city and shall mail to the owner of each premises in the city, immediately following the date any sewer service and use charges become due and payable, a bill for the sewer service and use charges which are then due and payable. Such bill shall be mailed to the person listed as the owner on the last equalized assessment roll of the county at the address shown on such assessment roll or to the address of such owner on file with the city clerk or to the successor in interest of such owner if the name and address of such successor in interest is known to the city clerk. The failure of the city clerk to mail any such bill or the failure of any owner to receive any such bill shall not excuse the owner of any premises from the obligation of paying any sewer service and use charge for any premises owned by him. 
(Code 1957, § 22A.14)  
Sec. 94-72. - Charges billed with water bills. 
So long as water service is connected to the premises liable for sewer and use charges and water is delivered to such premises by the city and bills are rendered by the city therefor, it shall be presumed that the sewer service and use have been rendered by the city to and for the premises and the person in whose name the water service is charged on the city's records. The sewer service and use charge shall be billed by the city with the water bills rendered by the city. Payment of the charge shall be made at the same time and in the same manner as water bills are paid, and all rules and regulations governing the collection of water bills shall apply in every particular to the collection of bills for the sewer service and use charges; provided, however, that the city clerk shall bill and collect all special charges for sewer service and use and all charges which are billed to a person other than the person in whose name the water meter is connected. 
(Code 1957, § 22A.15)  
Sec. 94-73. - Adjustments. 
It is the intent of this division, in establishing different sewer service and use charges for different classes of premises, to establish higher charges for those classes of premises which derive greater benefit from or impose greater burdens upon the sanitary sewer system because of the quality, quantity, or rate of flow of sewage which may be or is discharged by such class of premises into the sewer system, giving full consideration to other fees or taxes which may be paid by owners of the premises for the operation, maintenance, expansion, extension, or development of the sewer system. If, with respect to any of such premises, the city council should find that the charge applicable thereto is unfair and inequitable, the council may, by resolution, agreement, or otherwise, establish a special sewer service and use charge for such premises, different from those provided in this division and having a closer relationship to the benefit received or burden placed by such premises from or upon the sanitary sewer system, giving due consideration to other fees or taxes paid by such premises for the sewer system. However, any such agreement and any such special sewer service charge may at any time be revoked or changed by resolution of the council whenever it finds that continuance of the charge would be unfair or inequitable under the circumstances.

Plumbing fixtures and equipment connected to such hydromechanical grease interceptor shall be provided with an approved type of flow control so that the total flow through the device or devices shall not be greater than the rated flow of the FOG disposal system. 
(2)  Hydromechanical grease interceptors shall be installed as provided for in subsection (a)(1) with the additional provision that the storage of removed fats, oils and grease also be outside of food and utensil handling areas in a secure location that protects against the accidental spill of fats, oils and grease onto floor drains, parking lots, catch basins, storm drains, sidewalks, streets, or gutters and is protected from inundation by stormwater flows. 
(3)  Gravity grease interceptors shall be installed outside of the structure containing the kitchen, food or utensil handling area(s) in a location affording ease of inspection, cleaning, maintenance and servicing without entry to the structure unless otherwise approved by the health officer. Such device shall be designed and sized to retain fats, oils and grease until accumulations can be removed by pumping the gravity grease interceptor. When so required by the health officer, gravity grease interceptors shall be equipped with an approved sample box. 
(b)  FOG disposal systems shall be maintained in efficient operating condition. 
(c)  FOG disposal systems shall be cleaned and fats, oils and grease removed at regular intervals. 
(d)  Fats, oils and grease removed shall be waste hauled periodically as part of the operation and maintenance requirements for FOG disposal systems and disposed of in a proper manner and at regular intervals. 
(Ord. No. U-1591, § 3, 11-2-2009)  
Sec. 94-114. - Existing FOG disposal systems. 
Existing FOG disposal systems may remain in service provided such systems are properly maintained to effectively reduce the discharge of fats, oils and grease, are operating within original design parameters, and have not been altered in a manner not approved by the health officer. Such authorization does not preclude the health officer from establishing discharge limitations which may require the modification, enlargement, addition or replacement of a FOG disposal system to protect the sanitary sewer system from blockages or overflows. 
(Ord. No. U-1591, § 3, 11-2-2009)  
Sec. 94-115. - Variance of FOG disposal system requirements. 
(a)  The health officer may grant a variance from the FOG disposal system requirements of sections 94-112, 94-113, and 94-114 of this article to allow alternative technology that is, at least, equally effective in controlling the discharge of fats, oils and grease in lieu of a FOG disposal system, where an FSE demonstrates to the health officer's satisfaction that it is impossible to install, operate or maintain a FOG disposal system, or where an FSE demonstrates to the health officer's satisfaction that any discharge of fats, oils and grease from the FSE is negligible and will not have a significant impact on the sanitary sewer system. 
(b)  An FSE may submit an application for variance from the FOG disposal system requirements to the health officer. The health officer shall determine the terms and conditions for issuance of a variance. The health officer may revoke a variance at any time when any one of the terms and conditions for its issuance is not satisfied. 
(c)  Any decision of the health officer to grant or deny a variance may be appealed to the city administrator by any person within ten days after notice of the health officer's decision has been provided to the applicant. An applicant for a variance shall file an application and pay an application fee in the amount set forth by resolution of the city council. Any decision on appeal of the city administrator's decision to grant or deny a variance may be appealed to the city council by any person within ten days after notice of the city administrator's decision has been provided to the applicant. The decision of the city council upon an appeal from an action of the city administrator shall be final and conclusive.

Sec. 94-116. - Public nuisance. 
The city council finds and determines that sanitary sewer overflows may cause threat and injury to the public's health, safety and general welfare and are declared to be public nuisances and shall be punishable as such. Further, the discharge of wastewater in any manner in violation of this article or of any order issued by the health officer, as authorized by this article, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be punishable as such. 
(Ord. No. U-1591, § 3, 11-2-2009)  
Sec. 94-117. - Sanitary sewer overflowsAbatement orders and clean up costs. 
Notwithstanding any waiver or variance of FOG disposal system requirements under this article, FSEs determined by the health officer to contribute to a sanitary sewer system blockage, overflow, or interference resulting from the discharge of wastewater containing fats, oils, and grease, may be ordered by the health officer to immediately install and maintain a FOG disposal system, and may be subject to a plan determined by the health officer to abate the nuisance and prevent any future health hazards created by sanitary sewer line failures, blockages, overflows, or other interferences. Sewer lateral failures and sanitary sewer overflows caused by an FSE or multiple FSEs shall be the responsibility of the private property owner(s) or the FSE(s), and any individual as a responsible officer or owner of the FSE(s). If the city must act immediately to contain and clean up a sanitary sewer overflow caused by blockage of a private or public sewer lateral or serving an FSE, or at the request of the property owner or operator of the FSE, or because of failure of the property owner or FSE to abate the condition causing immediate threat to the public's health, safety or general welfare, the city's costs for such abatement and damages for any injuries to the city's sanitary sewer system shall be entirely borne by the operator(s) of the FSE(s), and any individual as a responsible officer or owner of the FSE(s), and shall constitute a debt to the city and become due and immediately payable upon the city's request for reimbursement of such costs. If the city is unable to recover all costs and damages from the operator(s) of the FSE(s), or any individual as a responsible officer or owner of the FSE(s), the costs shall be borne by the private property owner(s) or both the private property owner(s) and the operator(s) of the FSE(s), and any individual as a responsible officer or owner of the FSE(s). 
(Ord. No. U-1591, § 3, 11-2-2009)

(b)  After 12 payments have been made in the month in which they were due for monthly billing or after six payments have been made in the month in which they were due for bimonthly billing, the deposit will be credited to the depositor. 
(Code 1957, § 28.51)  
Sec. 94-147. - Consumer moving into location with current service. 
When a consumer moves into a place of business or residence from which water service was not previously discontinued and does not call at the office and make proper arrangements for service within a period of three days, the service will be discontinued and the administrative/reconnection service charge collected before service is again resumed. 
(Code 1957, § 28.52)  
Sec. 94-148. - Turning on water supply. 
When turning on the water supply as requested and the house and property is vacant, the city will endeavor to ascertain if water is running on the inside of the building. If such is found to be the case, the meter will be left shut off at the curb cock on the inlet side of the meter or on the outlet side at the customer hand valve between the house and the meter, and a notice will be left at the property stating why water was not turned on. Every property owner for his own convenience and safety must have a customer-owned wheel valve at some convenient place between the meter and the building. 
(Code 1957, § 28.53)  
Sec. 94-149. - Discontinuance of service. 
(a)  Upon notification by the owner or occupant of a building or premises to have the water shut off, the city shall have the water shut off on the supply side of the meter within 48 hours of receiving written notice to discontinue service. At that time the meter reading shall be recorded and a bill rendered which shall include a cost for the amount of water used according to the rates and charges provided and for the prorated monthly minimum service charge due for the fractional part of the current billing period. 
(b)  The person last accepting responsibility for the water utility account shall be responsible for all charges and fees until notification is received by the service office to close the account in the name of that person. A valid forwarding address is also required to relieve the consumer of liability for the water utility bill. 
(Code 1957, § 28.54)  
Sec. 94-150. - Temporary service. 
Any applicant for temporary water service shall be required to deposit the estimated cost of the facilities required and the water to be used. Upon discontinuance of use, payment will be adjusted to the actual cost to the city of placing and removing meter, connection, etc., and the water consumed will be billed at regular rates. 
(Code 1957, § 28.55)  
Sec. 94-151. - Responsibility for payments. 
(a)  Except for master-metered apartment buildings or unless a property owner consents by written agreement that water service be furnished to tenants on the property owner's account, the occupant of any premises shall be responsible for payment of any water and service charges applicable to premises occupied by him. It shall be the occupant's duty to inform the city immediately of all circumstances and of any change in circumstances that will in any way affect the applicability of any charge to premises occupied by him or the amount of any such charge. In particular, but not by way of limitation, an occupant of any premises shall immediately inform the city clerk of any sale or transfer of the ownership or leasehold interest to such premises by or to such occupant. 
(b)  Whenever the property is vacant or unoccupied and the owner or his authorized agent or lessee notifies the city in writing that until further notice no water will be required on the premises, there shall be no charge for water on the premises from the time of notifying the city until further notice is given by such owner or agent or lessee that the discontinued service be resumed. 
(Code 1957, § 28.56)  
Sec. 94-152. - Prior delinquent bills. 
An applicant may be refused water service if he has previous delinquent and unpaid bills for water service at another location served by the city or other delinquent or unpaid city bills, licenses, fees, permits, or other charges. 
(Code 1957, § 28.57)  
Sec. 94-153. - Supplanted service. 
If the city's public works improvements interfere with existing water service to a consumer provided by a supplier other than the city, the city may, upon agreement of all parties affected, provide such water service instead of such other supplier. The city reserves the right and power to contract separately with any such consumer for the sale and delivery of water at times, places and prices to be fixed by the city council. The council may agree to furnish water to such consumer at prices equivalent to those paid by the city consumer to the supplanted supplier if it finds the city benefits thereby. 
(Code 1957, § 28.58)  
Sec. 94-154. - Billing. 
(a)  Water meters shall be read as near monthly as possible where the billing is to be monthly and as near bimonthly as possible where bimonthly billing is to be used. The finance director shall, as soon as practical, after the first day of the month succeeding the month for which the charges were incurred for monthly billing and the first day of the month succeeding the two-month period in which the charges were incurred for bimonthly billing, mail or deliver to each consumer a statement of water service charges for the preceding month or two-month period, as the case may be. All charges shall be due and payable at the office of the city treasurer on the first day of the next succeeding month following the month in which the charges were incurred and shall become delinquent at 12:00 midnight on the last day of the month. If bimonthly billing is made by the city, such water service charges shall become due on the first day of the first month following the bimonthly period for which the charges are billed, and the charges shall become delinquent at 12:00 midnight on the last day of the month. 
(b)  Payment for such service charges made by United States mail where the envelope containing such payments is properly addressed, bears sufficient postage, and is postmarked at any time prior to 12:00 midnight of the day on which such charges would otherwise become delinquent shall be accepted as payment before delinquency. If the day on which the payment of charges would otherwise be delinquent falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next full business day thereafter shall be considered as a day on which the delinquency occurs. 
(c)  City hall is the only authorized paying station. If paid elsewhere, the city is not responsible if payment is delayed in reaching the office, and penalties for late payment will be charged. 
(Code 1957, § 28.60; Ord. No. 1545, § 30, 11-3-2003)  
Sec. 94-155. - Nonreceipt of bills. 
The city is responsible for delivering the water bills to the United States Postal Service. Failure of the consumer to receive a bill from the United States Postal Service does not relieve the consumer of the requirement for payment, nor is nonreceipt of a bill cause to remove a penalty from the account. 
(Code 1957, § 28.61)  
Sec. 94-156. - Registration failure; bill estimation. 
If a water meter fails to register during any month, a charge will be made upon the amount of water used during the same month of the previous year. If there was no meter at the premises in question during the previous year, a charge will be made upon the estimate fixed by the water superintendent or director which shall be paid by the consumer. 
(Code 1957, § 28.62)  
Sec. 94-157. - Assumption of use. 
(a)  In all cases the city will assume that water has been used where any person has had the opportunity to use water, and even though he may not have used any water during the month or billing period he will not be entitled to any rebate from the regular rate provided in such cases unless he has notified the city in writing to discontinue such service. 
(b)  The city's regular rates for water shall be charged in every instance for premises vacated until the city shall have been notified in writing by the owner or his agent and filed with the service clerk in the water division of the discontinuance of the use of water upon such premises. 
(Code 1957, § 28.63)  
Sec. 94-158. - Liability during discontinued period. 
If, after water service has been discontinued but before the service is reconnected for the new customer, the meter indicates water has been used, the owner of the property shall be responsible for charges incurred during the discontinued period. 
(Code 1957, § 28.64)  
Sec. 94-159. - Records.

(Code 1957, § 28.65)  
Sec. 94-160. - Dispute settlement. 
If a dispute arises between any water consumer and the city concerning water service or the amount of the water bill to such consumer, the dispute may be settled subject to the approval of the city council and the finance director. The provisions and procedures provided for in this section are permissive, only, and shall in no way affect any of the other sections of this article or bind the city to any set formula for settling disputes. 
(Code 1957, § 28.66; Ord. No. 1545, § 31, 11-3-2003)  
Sec. 94-161. - Delinquent penalties.

(Code 1957, § 28.70)  
Sec. 94-162. - Disconnection notice. 
A final notice of imminent disconnection of water service shall be made to the occupants of the premises before service is discontinued. A fee per unit for this notification will be charged to the account as pursuant to section 94-263. 
(Code 1957, § 28.71)  
Sec. 94-163. - Disconnection for delinquency. 
If a bill for water service charges, penalties, and disconnection notice delivery fee is not paid, the water service shall be turned off after a final notice advising the customer of such shutoff on or before the expiration of approximately 20 days following the date on which it becomes delinquent. A further administrative/reconnection fee; other delinquent or unpaid city bills, licenses, fees, permits, or other charges; and a security deposit shall be paid before the service is then reconnected, pursuant to section 94-263. No checks shall be accepted for payment of disconnected accounts. 
(Code 1957, § 28.72)  
Sec. 94-164. - Deposit increase for delinquent accounts. 
If a consumer who has made a deposit to guarantee the payment of water service charges fails to pay his delinquent bill together with all added penalties and fees before the 20th day following the day in which such bill becomes delinquent, the deposit shall be increased to the minimum set by section 94-263, or increased to the equivalent of the delinquent amount including penalties and fees. 
(Code 1957, § 28.73)  
Sec. 94-165. - Payment extensions and penalty and fee waivers. 
If the finance director determines that an extension of time or relief from any penalty for violation of this division should be granted, the director or designee may authorize in writing an extension of such time limits not to exceed 30 days or authorize the waiver of penalties. Only one such extension or waiver shall be granted in a calendar year, except in hardship situations as determined by the finance director, who shall maintain a record of reasons for granting the extension. No extension of time may be granted to waive delinquent penalties. Elected officials are not eligible for any payment extensions and penalty and fee waivers without the express consent of the city council. 
(Code 1957, § 28.74; Ord. No. 1489, § 1, 1-20-1998; Ord. No. 1545, § 32, 11-3-2003)  
Sec. 94-166. - Penalty for turning on water after turnoff. 
No person shall turn on water or suffer it to be turned on at any meter or other connection to the city's water distribution system after the water has been turned off by the city. Meter readings will be taken when the meter is shut off, and any increase in the reading will be considered proof that the meter had been turned on, even if found in the off position when checked. For each time the employees of the water division are required to again turn the water off or determine that the meter had been turned on and off, a tampering fee shall be charged pursuant to section 94-263. 
(Code 1957, § 28.75)  
Sec. 94-167. - Returned checks. 
When a water customer presents the city with a check or other negotiable instrument in payment of a water bill that is not negotiable either because of a insufficient funds, closed account, or other reason, the customer, pursuant to section 94-263, shall present the city with cash covering the amount of the check plus a penalty. If payment is not made, disconnection shall take place within 48 hours of notification of the customer with appropriate reconnection penalties.

Sec. 94-169. - Connection size. 
The city reserves the right to determine the size of the water service connection and its location with respect to the boundaries of the premises to be served. The laying of the consumer pipe to the curb shall not be done until the service connection is installed. If the consumer lays his pipe to the curb before or after the service connection is installed and its location is more than five feet from where the service connection enters the property, the consumer shall bear the extra cost of connecting the service connecting pipe to the consumer pipe. 
(Code 1957, § 28.81)  
Sec. 94-170. - One meter per lot. 
No more than one water meter shall be installed on any lot or parcel of real property without the approval and consent of the director or water superintendent. 
(Code 1957, § 28.82)  
Sec. 94-171. - Multiple meters. 
For the purpose of making charges, all water meters upon a consumer's premises will be considered separately, and the reading thereof shall not be combined. However, when the water division shall, for operating necessity, install upon the consumer's premises in place of one meter two or more in parallel, the reading of such two or more meters shall be combined for the purpose of making charges. 
(Code 1957, § 28.83)

Such valve or curbstop is intended for the exclusive use by the city in controlling the water supply through the service connection pipe. If the curbstop or shutoff valve is damaged by the consumer's use to an extent requiring repair or replacement, such repair or replacement shall be at the consumer's expense. For ordinary usage, a consumer shall provide his own valves between the meter and the first half or branch of the consumer's service line. 
(Code 1957, § 28.88)  
Sec. 94-177. - Shutoff valve installation.

Sec. 94-178. - Checkvalve required. 
If the placing of a checkvalve on the property side of the city's water facilities or to the water meter of any consumer is necessary in the opinion of the water superintendent for the water system safety and protection or appliances thereof, such consumer shall be notified in writing by the water superintendent to have an approved checkvalve installed at his expense. If, after five days' written notice, such checkvalve has not been installed and working, the service shall be discontinued and the water shut off until such a checkvalve is installed and the city notified. Service shall be restored only upon payment of required administrative/reconnection charge. After such checkvalve is installed, the consumer shall be required to provide an annual or more frequent, if required by the director, inspection of the checkvalve by a qualified inspector and provide the city with a certificate showing that the checkvalve is functioning properly.

Any such vandalism to any city meter or other water division device or equipment may result in tampering fees and/or legal action. 
(b)  After the water meter is so connected to the water service or service pipe, any damage to such meter resulting from vandalism, carelessness, or negligence of the consumer or any member of his family or anyone employed by him or any damage which may result from hot water or steam from a boiler or otherwise shall be paid for by such consumer to the city. If such bill is not paid, the water shall be shut off from the premises without further notice, and the water shall not be turned on until all charges are paid.

Such demand shall be made in writing to the water division and shall be accompanied by a deposit. Upon receipt of such demand it shall be the duty of the water division to cause the meter to be examined and tested. If on examination and test the meter shall be found to register over three percent more water than actually passes through it, another meter shall be substituted for it, and the deposit shall be repaid to the person making the application and the water bill for the current period adjusted in such a manner as the water superintendent may deem fair and just. If the meter is found to register not over three percent fast, the deposit shall be forfeited to the city and the water bill paid as rendered.

(a)  Any person requesting a water main extension by the city shall deposit with the city a sum fixed by the director equal to the estimated cost thereof plus the then-current city's overhead cost attributable to such work. 
(b)  The city upon completion of such work shall deduct from such deposit the actual cost and overhead attributable thereto and reimburse any remaining balance to the person depositing the cost. If for any reason the deposit is not sufficient to pay the actual cost thereof, together with overhead attributable thereto, the person applying for such extension shall pay the excess forthwith on demand of the city, and until paid the city may refuse to supply water for such extension. Where any such extension will thereafter provide the means of supplying water to property other than that owned by the applicant, the cost of such extension shall be spread by the city engineer on a square-footage basis to all property that can be served therefrom. Any person thereafter connecting a meter on to such extension to serve water to any property not owned by the original applicant shall pay to the city, in addition to all meter and water charges, an extension charge equal to the property area in square-foot charge as spread by the city engineer, multiplied by the square footage of his property fronting on the street served by such extension, which sum so collected shall be reimbursed to the original depositor who originally paid for the extension, provided the right to reimburse accrues within ten years from the date extension was first completed.

The city clerk shall further notify such affected property owners of the necessity that, if they or any person occupying such property desire to continue to receive electric, communication, or similar or associated service, they or such occupant shall provide all necessary facility changes on their premises so as to receive such service from the lines of the supplying utility at a new location. 
(b)  Notification by the city clerk shall be made by mailing a copy of the resolution adopted pursuant to section 94-335, together with a copy of this article, to affected property owners as such are shown on the last equalized assessment roll and to the affected utilities. 
(Code 1957, § 27A.9)  
Sec. 94-340. - Responsibility of utility companies. 
If underground construction is necessary to provide utility service within a district created by any resolution adopted pursuant to section 94-335, the supplying utility shall furnish that portion of the conduits, conductors, and associated equipment required to be furnished by it under its applicable rules, regulations, and tariffs on file with the commission. 
(Code 1957, § 27A.10)  
Sec. 94-341. - Responsibility of property owners and occupants.

If this is not accomplished by any person within the time provided for in the resolution enacted pursuant to section 94-335, the city engineer shall give notice in writing to the person in possession of such premises and a notice in writing to the owner thereof as shown on the last equalized assessment roll to provide the required underground facilities. The city engineer may also post written notice on the property being served and 30 days thereafter may authorize the disconnection and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying utility service to the property. 
(b)  The notice to provide the required underground facilities may be given either by personal service or by mail. For service by mail, the notice must be deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope with postage prepaid, addressed to the person in possession of such premises at such premises, and the notice must be addressed to the owner thereof, as such owner's name appears, and must be addressed to such owner's last known address, as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll, and when no address appears to general delivery in the city. If notice is given by mail, such notice shall be deemed to have been received by the person to whom it has been sent within 48 hours after the mailing thereof. If notice is given by mail to either the owner or occupant of such premises, the city engineer shall, within 48 hours after the mailing thereof, cause a copy thereof, printed on a card not less than eight inches by ten inches in size, to be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. 
(c)  The notice given by the city engineer to provide the required underground facilities shall particularly specify what work is required to be done and shall state that if the work is not completed within 30 days after receipt of such notice, the city engineer will provide such required underground facilities, in which case the cost and expense thereof will be assessed against the property benefited and shall become a lien upon such property. 
(d)  If, upon the expiration of the 30-day period, the required underground facilities have not been provided, the city engineer shall forthwith proceed to do the work; provided, however, if such premises are unoccupied and no electric or communications services are being furnished thereto, the city engineer shall, in lieu of providing the required underground facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying utility service to the property. Upon completion of the work by the city engineer, he shall file a written report with the city council setting forth the fact that the required underground facilities have been provided and the cost thereof, together with a legal description of the property against which such cost is to be assessed. The council shall thereupon fix a time and place for hearing protests against the assessment of the cost of such work upon such premises, which time shall not be less than ten days thereafter. 
(e)  The city engineer shall forthwith, upon the time for hearing such protests having been fixed, give a notice in writing to the person in possession of such premises and a notice in writing to the owner thereof, in the manner provided in this section for the giving of the notice to provide the required underground facilities, of the time and place that the council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against such assessment. Such notice shall also set forth the amount of the proposed assessment. 
(f)  Upon the date and hour set for hearing of protests, the council shall hear and consider the report and all protests, if any, and then proceed to affirm, modify, or reject the assessment. 
(g)  If any assessment is not paid within five days after its confirmation by the council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien upon the property against which the assessment is made by the city engineer, and the city engineer is directed to turn over to the assessor and tax collector a notice of lien on each of the properties on which the assessment has not been paid. The assessor and tax collector shall add the amount of the assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the premises upon which the assessment was not paid. The assessment shall be due and payable at the same time as the property taxes are due and payable and, if not paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per annum. 
(Code 1957, § 27A.11)  
Sec. 94-342. - Responsibility of city.

Sec. 94-343. - Extension of time for compliance. 
If any act required by this article or by a resolution adopted pursuant to section 94-335 cannot be performed within the time provided because of shortage of materials, war, restraint by public authorities, strikes, labor disturbances, civil disobedience, or any other circumstances beyond the control of the actor, the time within which such act shall be accomplished shall be extended for a period equivalent to the time of such limitation.

Care shall be exercised by all individuals, developers and contractors working near preserved trees so that no damage occurs to such trees. All construction shall preserve and protect the health of trees to remain, relocated trees, and new trees planted to replace those removed in accordance with the following measures: 
(1)  All trees to be saved shall be enclosed/delineated by an appropriate construction barrier, such as fencing or other mechanism, prior to commencement of work. Barriers are to remain in place during all phases of construction and may not be removed without the written consent of the public works director. 
(2)  Such barrier(s) must be located a distance from the trunk base of two times the trunk diameter, up to a maximum of 15 feet, unless otherwise approved in writing by the public works director. 
(3)  No fill material shall be placed within three feet from the outer trunk circumference of any tree.

When some root removal is necessary, the tree crown may require thinning to prevent wind damage. 
(Ord. No. 1539, § 3, 11-4-2002)  
Sec. 98-34. - City-owned trees removal. 
Within available resources, the city shall implement practices to prevent the removal of existing public trees whenever possible. The removal of a single tree or groups of trees may be approved pursuant to this article, after one of the following findings has been made: 
(1)  The tree is dead. 
(2)  The tree has reached an over-mature condition for its pre-existing location and will result in the deterioration of surrounding hardscaped areas potentially resulting in a health and safety hazard. 
(3)  The tree which is infected with a disease which cannot be treated successfully, or there is a strong potential that the pathogen could spread to other trees in the immediate vicinity. 
(4)  The tree has a severe void of heartwood due to wood consuming organisms which could potentially cause catastrophic failure (i.e. collapse). 
(5)  A tree has been determined to be a hazard because of its high potential for failure due to considerable dead or dying foliage, branches, roots or trunk. 
(6)  The tree requires extensive root pruning because of excessive hardscape damage resulting in the severe reduction of its capacity to support itself thereby creating a potential safety hazard. 
(7)  A healthy living tree that has caused damage to any underground utility as a result of root blockage. 
(8)  A tree that is causing an immediate threat to the health and safety or general welfare of the public. 
(9)  As part of a master plan approved by city council. 
(Ord. No. 1539, § 3, 11-4-2002)  
Sec. 98-35. - Inspection and evaluation process. 
(a)  Prior to the removal of any city-owned tree, it shall be the city's responsibility to evaluate the condition of the tree's root system, trunk, branching system, canopy and foliage. Based upon this evaluation, the public works director in consultation with the city's tree commission shall make a determination as to whether the tree must be removed. However, in the case of a heritage tree the final determination will be made by city council upon recommendation by the tree commission. Public works staff and if necessary the public works director shall initiate the review process. In cases where, following an evaluation by public works staff, a tree is posing an immediate hazard and is considered to be a threat to public safety, the public works director shall have administrative authority to allow the tree to be immediately removed in the interest of public safety. 
(b)  The city council shall have the discretion to identify special situations where a targeted replacement program may be desirable. An example is a comprehensive streetscape project in a commercial district where a primary goal is to unify the area through a newly designed streetscape. Street trees are a significant unifying feature and it may be important to replace all or a portion of the trees in order to create this unity and give a special identity to the particular street. In cases where this is appropriate as determined by the city council, the city shall make relocation of existing healthy trees that are removed a priority. 
(Ord. No. 1539, § 3, 11-4-2002)  
Sec. 98-36. - Relocation and transplanting. 
In the event a city-owned tree must be removed pursuant to one of the conditions outlined in section 98-34 of this article, all reasonable efforts should be made to conserve these trees through transplanting. The following factors should be considered when attempting to relocate a tree: 
(1)  The appraised value and species of the tree in relation to the cost of relocation. 
(2)  The available size of grow space for the root ball of the relocated tree. 
(3)  How the tree is to be transported. 
(4)  How the tree can be maneuvered into the site once it gets there. 
(5)  Existing underground and overhead utilities. 
(6)  Long-term and short-term maintenance and irrigation requirements of the tree. 
(7)  The mature size of the tree. 
(8)  Chances of surviving relocation. 
(9)  Public concerns. 
(Ord. No. 1539, § 3, 11-4-2002)  
Sec. 98-37. - Tree plans. 
(a)  The public works department in conjunction with the city's tree commission shall review all plans for new development in the city and may require as a condition of approval of a project that a particular number of street trees of the species desired in section 98-38 be planted in accordance with this article. 
(b)  Specific tree plans/tree focus areas, specifically designed to enhance/revitalize a certain area of the city, where trees are to be planted on public property, may also be adopted and amended by resolution of the city council from time-to-time. Once adopted, these plans shall also be included into this article and comply with all requirements and regulations set forth herein.

(d)  The cost for replacement of a street tree, pursuant to this article, shall include the actual cost of a replacement street tree to replace the street tree that has been removed, cut, damaged or destroyed, and shall also include the cost of transporting and planting the replacement street tree. The type, number, size and location of replacement street trees shall be determined by the public works director or his or her designee. 
(e)  The city council hereby directs that all fines imposed for violation of this article be used in reforestation efforts or for the implementation of a component of the tree master plan. 
(Ord. No. 1539, § 3, 11-4-2002)

At the time of application, a review of the location, design, configuration and impact of the proposed use shall be conducted by comparing such use to fixed and established standards. This review shall determine whether the proposed use should be permitted by weighing the public need for and the benefit to be derived from the use against the impact which it may cause.

Sec. 106-176. - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of this subdivision is to preserve a healthy environment for residents and businesses by establishing a set of consistent standards for the safe operation of business establishments that include the sale of alcoholic beverages.

The intent of this subdivision is to address and prevent alcohol-related impacts, including drunk driving, public inebriation, littering, loitering, obstruction of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, harassment of passerbys, encouragement of crime, defacement of buildings or structures, graffiti, excessive noise and other similar zoning problems and public nuisance activity.

(1)  Sections 106-696, 106-697 and 106-698 regarding minimum setback dimensions. The director may reduce front and rear setback requirements a maximum of ten percent for lots having a depth greater than 100 feet and a maximum of two feet (minimum setback three feet) for side yards for lots having a width greater than 50 feet if the director finds that the impact of the setback reduction will be in keeping with the general overall surrounding environment. 
(2)  Subsection 106-700(c) regarding exceptions to setback depths. The director may use the average setback depth of the closest conforming use when determining the building line setback depth for a vacant parcel situated between conforming and nonconforming uses abutting the same street if the director finds that the proposed development activity furthers the goals of the land use element of the general plan and does not adversely affect the air, light and fire safety of the adjoining nonconforming use. 
(3)  Subsection 106-829(1) regarding minimum parking stall dimensions for covered parking space for residential uses. The director may reduce the minimum parking stall length and width size for residential use by ten percent if the director finds that reduction in dimensional size allows adequate area for ingress and egress circulation movement to the covered space. 
(4)  Section 106-966 regarding landscaping standards for property zoned residential. The director may reduce the front yard landscaping requirement, which requires 50 percent front yard coverage with live landscaping, if the director finds that the dimensions of the site do not provide adequate space to accommodate circulation access to the covered off-street parking facility and if all unpaved surface areas will be adequately landscape maintained. 
(5)  Sections 106-968 and 106-969 regarding commercial and industrial development standards pertaining to lot coverage, landscaping, parking and loading, and signs. The director may make the following accommodations if alternative project design solutions demonstrate the need for minor adjustments and if the solution proposal will be compatible to the character of the surrounding development. Allowable accommodations are as follows: 
a.  Lot coverage: a maximum increase of five percent. 
b.  Landscaping: a maximum one-percent reduction from landscaping requirement permitting nine percent in commercial zones and 14 percent in industrial zones. 
c.  Parking and loading: a maximum five-percent reduction from parking space requirements and from dimensional area requirements for off-street loading space provided that the reduction will result in an enhanced level of vehicular circulation and safety. 
d.  Signs: a maximum increase of one linear foot in height pertaining to sign height requirements and a maximum increase of five square feet pertaining to sign area requirements. 
(6)  Section 106-252 pertaining to construction or reconstruction of nonconforming structures. The director, notwithstanding sections 106-247 and 106-252, may permit replacement of an existing structure along the same building footprint as the then-existing structure if the director finds the replacement construction or reconstruction proposal will be substantially similar to the structure being replaced, furthers the development requirements of the zone, restores the structure to a safe condition and not detrimental to the character of the surrounding properties, and is the only feasible means to achieve a workable solution.

DIVISION 6. - NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES 
 
Sec. 106-246. - Intent and purpose. 
Within the zones established by this chapter or amendments that may be adopted, there exist or will exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter derives or amendment of this chapter, but which no longer comply. The intent of this division is to permit those nonconformities to continue until they are removed or required to be terminated, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses and structures are declared to be incompatible with permitted uses, structures and standards in the zones involved, and it is intended that they shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone, except as may be expressly permitted in this division. 
(Ord. No. 1270, § 30.820, 9-30-1985; Ord. No. 1305, 6-15-1987)  
Sec. 106-247. - Adding new uses and structures. 
When a nonconforming use or structure exists on any lot or parcel of land, no new use or structure may be established or built on such land unless the required lot area, dimensions, yards and open spaces are provided for each existing and proposed use, structure and improvement. These uses shall be so located on the lot or parcel of land that, if it is divided into smaller lots or parcels, each of the parcels will contain the area, dimensions, yards and open space required and the number and location of structures on each will comply with the requirements of this chapter when considered as a separate lot or parcel. When there is the intent to divide or subdivide, additional conforming structures shall not be permitted until after the parcel has been divided or subdivided in accordance with law. Access acceptable to the city shall be provided to all lots where such division is permitted.

Sec. 106-250. - Continuation of nonconforming use of land. 
A lawful use of land made no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as adopted or amended may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following: 
(1)  Such use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives or applicable amendment. 
(2)  Such use shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied by such use on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives or applicable amendment. 
(3)  If such use ceases for any reason for a period of more than six consecutive calendar months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the requirements of this chapter for the zone in which it is located. 
(4)  If provision is made for the termination of such use, any use of such land after termination shall conform to the requirements of this chapter for the zone in which it is located.

Sec. 106-251. - Continuation of nonconforming use of structure. 
A lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination, under the terms of this chapter as adopted or amended may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following: 
(1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the zone in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zone in which it is located and except as specifically provided for in this chapter. 
(2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives or at the time of amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(3)  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the planning commission, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is no more detrimental to the zone than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards. 
(4)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(5)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive calendar months, the structure, or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the zone in which it is located. 
(6)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall thereafter compel the discontinuance of the nonconforming use of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection means damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost of the structure immediately prior to destruction. 
(7)  When a nonconforming use of a structure is replaced by a more restrictive nonconforming use, the occupancy may not thereafter revert to a less restrictive use. 
(8)  If provision is made for the termination date of such use, any use of such land after termination shall conform to the requirements of this chapter for the zone in which it is located.

(a)  Any structure made nonconforming by this chapter as adopted or amended may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following: 
(1)  Such structure may not be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, except as specifically provided for by this chapter. 
(2)  Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost immediately prior to destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with this chapter. 
(3)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone in which it is located. 
(4)  Such structure may be repaired provided: 
a.  The work consists only of the repair and replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing; 
b.  Where the aggregate costs do not exceed the current assessed value of the improvements; and 
c.  Where the cubic space within the structure as it existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter is not increased. 
(5)  If provision is made for the termination of such structure or its nonconforming characteristics, any use of such land after the termination date shall conform to the requirements of this chapter for the zone in which it is located. 
(6)  An existing nonconforming dwelling in a C-1 or C-2 zone destroyed more than 50 percent of its replacement cost immediately prior to destruction may be rebuilt on the same building footprint, provided that: 
a.  The property is 5,000 square feet or less in size, and could not feasibly be developed separately as a commercial facility. 
b.  The property fronts on a residential street, and not along a commercial thoroughfare. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section or any other subsection of this section, a nonconforming structure shall not be changed in its utilization to another use in any land use zone until the structure meets all applicable requirements for new construction for the use under the various ordinances and Code provisions of this city then in effect, including but not limited to building and fire code provisions and property development standards for the particular zone. 
(c)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any city or state official charged with protecting the public health or safety, upon order of such official.

Sec. 106-291. - Purpose. 
This division is intended to relieve the owner of property from any inability to make reasonable use of his property in the same manner that other property of like character in the same vicinity and zone can be used. A variance which may be granted only by the planning commission shall not be granted which confers a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the same vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated or which authorizes a use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the zoning regulations governing the parcel of property.

Following a public hearing on a variance application, the planning commission shall record the decision in writing and shall recite therein the findings of fact upon which such decision is based. The commission may approve and/or modify an application in whole or in part, with or without conditions, only after it makes all of the following findings of fact in a positive manner: 
(1)  There are special circumstances or exceptional characteristics applicable to the property involved, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings such that strict application of this chapter deprives such property of privileges, enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under the identical zoning classification. 
(2)  The granting of such variance will not be detrimental to the public interest, safety, health or welfare, and will not be detrimental or injurious to the property or improvements in the same vicinity and zone in which the property is located. 
(3)  The granting of such variance will not be contrary to or in conflict with the general purposes and intent of this chapter, nor to the goals and programs of the general plan. 
(4)  The variance request is consistent with the purpose and intent of the zone in which the site is located.

The following conditions and restrictions shall apply to any proposed ADU: 
(1)  Number of units allowed. The lot on which an ADU is constructed shall contain no more than one lawful and pre-existing single-family residence, and not more than one ADU.

(3)  Owner occupancy and restrictive covenant. One of the dwelling units on the site (either the primary dwelling unit or the ADU) shall be owner-occupied at all times. The ADU shall not be sold separately from the primary dwelling unit. If, at any time, the owner of the property upon which the primary dwelling unit and the ADU are located ceases to reside in either the primary dwelling unit or the ADU as his or her primary place of residence, then any tenancy or other occupancy of the ADU shall be prohibited. In the case where an ADU is occupied by a non-owner occupant, the owner shall terminate the occupancy of the ADU by or before the date upon which the owner ceases to reside in the primary dwelling unit. Any ongoing tenancy or occupancy of the ADU shall thereafter be an unlawful tenancy. The property owner shall enter into a restrictive covenant with the city that applies to the owner and all successors in interest, in a form acceptable to the city attorney that will be recorded on the subject property. The restrictive covenant shall: 
(i)  Specify that the property owner must reside in either the primary dwelling unit or the ADU; 
(ii)  Expressly prohibit the rental of both units at the same time and further provide that the owner shall prohibit any future tenancy or occupancy of the ADU once the owner ceases to reside in either the primary dwelling unit or the ADU and, in the case where the owner resides in the primary dwelling unit, also terminate any existing tenancy or occupancy of the ADU by a non-owner occupant by or before the date upon which the owner ceases to reside in the primary dwelling unit; 
(iii)  The ADU may be rented only for terms longer than 30 consecutive calendar days; 
(iv)  The ADU may not to be sold or conveyed separately from the primary residence; 
(v)  The property owner and all successors in interest shall maintain the ADU and the property in accordance with all applicable ADU requirements and standards; 
(vi)  Any violation will be subject to penalties as provided article II (general penalties) and article III (administrative penaltiesCitations) of chapter 1 (general provisions and penalties of the San Fernando City Code; and 
(vii)  An future sale of residential lots with ADUs shall require, prior to the close of escrow, an inspection by the building and safety supervisor or his or her designee to assure that all on-site residential structures have been maintained in compliance with applicable zoning and building code requirements. 
(4)  Rental restrictions. The unit may be rented but may not be rented for a period of less than 31 consecutive days. ADUs which are used as rental units will be required to obtain a rental permit from the city. 
(5)  Exterior access. To maintain the single-family residential character of the neighborhood and to the extent reasonably feasible in the reasonable judgment of the community development director, an ADU shall not have its exterior entrance visible from the street. Additionally, no exterior stairway shall be located on the front or on any street-facing side of the ADU. No passageway shall be required in conjunction with construction of an ADU. 
(6)  Separate bathroom and kitchen. The ADU shall include one full bathroom and one kitchen, and shall not include any additional bathrooms or kitchens. The ADU shall also be limited to a maximum of one bedroom.

a.  For ADUs created entirely within existing space, including the primary structure, attached or detached garage or other accessory structure, the city will not require the applicant to install a separate utility connection between the ADU and the utility, or impose a related connection fee or capacity charge. 
b.  For ADUs involving new construction (detached and attached additions), the city will not require a separate utility connection but will impose a capacity charge. Said charge will be proportionate to the burden of the proposed ADU upon the water or sewer system based upon either its size or the number of its plumbing fixtures, and will not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the water or sewer service. 
(10)  Standards for accessory dwelling unit structures created within existing space. An ADU that is developed entirely within an existing space, including the primary structure, attached or detached garage or other accessory structure, shall be permitted ministerially with a building permit subject to the following standards: 
a.  Zones: The unit shall be located in a single-family zone. 
b.  Separate entry required: The unit shall provide independent exterior access from the primary unit.

To the extent locations are available on the site which minimize the visibility of parking from the street, the director of community development, or his or her designee, can require parking to be located in these less invasive locations. In addition, the main single-family dwelling must meet the current number of off-street parking spaces required at the time the ADU is approved. 
(11)  Standards for accessory dwelling unit structures involving new construction (detached and attached additions). ADU developments that adhere to the following standards shall be permitted ministerially, except as explicitly set forth herein. 
a.  Development and design standards: All ADU developments, whether attached or detached, shall comply with all applicable zoning and development standards of the zoning district in which it will be located, including, but not limited to, standards regarding setbacks, floor area ratio standards, height, lot coverage, architectural design review, including compatibility with existing structures on the same property and in the surrounding neighborhood, except as explicitly set forth herein. 
1.  The ADU shall incorporate the same or similar architectural features, building materials and colors as the primary dwelling located on the property, and shall be designed to reasonably minimize privacy impacts. Compatibility with the existing primary structure includes coordination of colors, materials, roofing and other architectural features, and landscaping designed so that the appearance of the site remains that of a single-family residence. 
b.  Size: 
1.  The total area of habitable floor space for a detached ADU shall be no less than an efficiency unit, as defined by the California Building Code, and shall not exceed 640 square feet.

Second story attached ADUs shall be limited to the rear of existing two story single-family homes. 
d.  Manufactured housing: Manufactured housing is allowed in compliance with the provisions herein. A trailer, motor vehicle or other recreational vehicle, as defined in the section 106-6 (definitions) of chapter 106 (zoning) of the San Fernando City Code, may not be used as an ADU and stored or maintained as a habitable unit or livable area on a residential lot. 
e.  Parking: One off-street parking space shall be provided for the ADU, which may be provided as tandem parking on an existing driveway and shall be permitted in paved setback areas unless the director of community development, or his or her designee, makes specific findings that parking in setback areas or tandem parking is not feasible based upon specific site, regional topographical, or fire and life safety conditions. To the extent locations are available on the site which minimize the visibility of parking from the street, the director of community development, or his or her designee, can require parking to be located in these less invasive locations. In addition, the main single-family dwelling must meet the current number of off-street parking spaces required at the time the ADU is approved. 
Pursuant to state law, no parking shall be required for an ADU in any of the following instances: 
1.  The ADU is located within one-half mile of public transit. 
2.  The ADU is located within an architecturally and historically significant historic district.

5.  When there is a car share vehicle located within one block of the ADU. 
f.  Replacement parking: When a garage, carport, or covered parking structure is demolished in conjunction with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit, the lost parking spaces must be replaced with an equal number of spaces, which may be covered, uncovered, tandem within a garage or driveway, or provided by the use of a mechanical automotive parking lift within a garage structure. To the extent locations are available on the site which minimize the visibility of parking from the street, the director of community development, or his or her designee, can require parking to be located in these less invasive locations.

Sec. 106-459. - Procedure. 
(a)  Concept plan review. Prior to the submission of an application for a conditional use permit for an RPD residential planned development, the applicant shall submit, for preliminary review by the director, a concept plan. The concept plan should include, but is not limited to, the following: 
(1)  A schematic plan showing in general terms the uses proposed, densities, types of housing units, open spaces, streets, extent of grading, and landscaping. 
(2)  Calculations of the site area, number of dwelling units, and open space area. 
No decision will be made; however, the comments and suggestions of the director may assist the applicant in developing more precise plans. 
(b)  Conditional use permit application. An application for a conditional use permit to allow a residential planned development shall be filed by the applicant and acted upon by the commission, pursuant to division 4 of article II of this chapter. The application shall be accompanied by 15 copies of the general development proposal, including the following: 
(1)  Architectural and topographical survey map of the site and the area within 100 feet of the site, including all existing structures, improvements, trees, natural features, waterways, elevations, and contour lines (intervals not more than five feet, except where authorized by the director). An aerial photograph may, with approval of the director, be accepted in lieu of the map. 
(2)  General development plan showing the general location of all proposed structures and uses, types of housing, location and widths of streets, parking areas, pedestrian and bicycle circulation, recreation facilities, dedicated and commonly owned open space areas, extent of landscaping and grading (including two section drawings of the site, one generally north-south and one east-west, showing the existing contour and proposed graded contour of the site); geological and soil survey reports; method of drainage; an indication of the phasing of the development with each workable phase (see subsection (e) of this section) delineated; and a time schedule for the completion of each workable phase. 
(3)  Computations of gross site area, number and sizes of units in various housing types, common open space area and number of covered and uncovered parking spaces. Where the development is to be completed in phases, these computations shall also be shown for each workable phase of the development. 
(4)  Any of the requirements in subsections (b)(1) through (3) of this section may be modified or waived by the director, upon the finding that such requirement is unreasonable or unnecessary for the particular proposal, and the director shall inform the commission of any such modification or waiver prior to the hearing of the application. 
(5)  Three copies of rough drafts of proposed legal agreements and documents, including homeowners' association, deed restrictions, covenants, dedication of development rights, easements, and proposed method of maintenance and perpetuation of open space areas. 
(6)  Full disclosure of governmental programs, if any, under which the housing will be developed. 
(7)  Such other data or plans as may reasonably be required by the commission for a proper and complete consideration of the proposed development. 
(8)  Where subdivision of land is intended, tentative maps may be processed concurrently with the conditional use permit application; such tentative maps shall be drawn and submitted pursuant to chapter 78 of this Code. 
(c)  Revisions to plan. If, at the request of the applicant, revisions to the general development plans are desired, the following guidelines will be used by the director in determining the proper course of action: 
(1)  For minor revisions not involving a change in use, increase in density or extent or general location of buildings, or reduction in area of open space, the plans need not be returned to the commission; however, approval of the director is required. 
(2)  For revisions involving an increase in density, traffic flow or reduction of open space of no more than ten percent, and/or major change in location of building and open space, the revised plans must be reviewed by the commission and the conditional use permit amended as required. 
(3)  For major revisions involving a change in use or a decrease in the area of open space exceeding ten percent, a new conditional use permit application must be filed, a new filing fee paid, and public hearing scheduled. 
(d)  Bond for all common area and off-site improvements. Prior to issuance of a building or grading permit, and prior to approval of a final map where subdivision is involved, a bond or other acceptable security shall be posted to ensure the completion of all common area and off-site improvements within any phase of the development, including landscaping, recreational facilities, and other site features pursuant to approved plans. 
(e)  Phase. No occupancy permit shall be granted for any structure and no parcels, lots or portion of a residential planned development site shall be separately sold or encumbered, until approval of the director, upon the finding that all of the common area and off-site improvements in the phase of which such structure, parcel, lot or portion is a part are completed to the extent that the dwelling units are accessible and livable, and all dwelling units in the workable phase are substantially developed (all building walls covered), pursuant to the approved plans. A bond or other guarantee of substantial completion of all dwelling units in a phase may be accepted by the city in lieu of substantial completion. The commission may waive this requirement for substantial completion of all dwelling units in a phase upon the finding that, in the particular residential planned development, it is unnecessary for the protection of the city's residents' interest. A workable phase shall consist of either an entire residential planned development or a portion of a residential planned development which, in itself, is functional and meets the density and open space requirements of this chapter. The division of any residential planned development into workable phases shall be approved by the commission during the general development plan review. 
(f)  Time limit. If construction has not been completed to the point of foundation inspection for a unit within one year, or if the phase has not been completed within two years from the date of final approval of the final development proposal for the phase, the conditional use permit shall expire and be of no further effect, and any final map for the subdivision thereof shall become null and void, and the city, at its option, may cause the owner of the property to process, through the city, a subdivision to revert the property to acreage. A one-year extension may be granted by the commission for good cause and where conditions of the surrounding area have not changed to the extent that the general development proposal for the residential planned development or the final development proposal for any phase thereof no longer meets the conditional use permit or plan review criteria. 
(g)  Review criteria. Developments constructed under this division shall be of a superior design and quality and may include common recreation facilities not normally provided in a standard residential development which would occur under the applicable development standards of this chapter. During the review of the general development plans at the conditional use permit hearing, the commission shall use the following criteria in evaluating the proposed development: 
(1)  The proposed residential planned development conforms to the intent of the general plan and any specific plans adopted by the city. 
(2)  The site and grading plans indicate proper consideration for the preservation of existing trees and native plant growth, watercourses and other natural features, and natural topography. 
(3)  The plans for the proposed development show that proper and adequate consideration has been given to privacy at the individual, family and neighborhood levels, including visual and acoustical privacy, in terms of the separation and orientation of dwelling units and private outdoor living areas. 
(4)  The plans indicate that proper consideration has been given to auto and pedestrian circulation discouraging through traffic on local streets, speed control, access, convenience, safety, and the recreational aspects of pedestrian and bicycle circulation, and that the design of any proposed streets that vary from city standards indicates that they will perform the function required and that the off-site improvements will not create maintenance costs to the city which greatly exceed the costs for standard off-site improvements. 
(5)  The plans indicate that the common open space areas will be usable for recreation and/or valuable for views, conservation and/or separation of dwelling units. 
(6)  The plans indicate that proper consideration has been given to the provision of common recreation areas and facilities, in relation to the size of the private lots and reduced recreation opportunities in private yards. 
(7)  The plans indicate proper consideration for adjacent existing and future developments, and the extension of the circulation, open space, drainage and utility systems from one development to another.

(5)  San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan. The San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan (SP-5), a copy of which is on file in the office of the city clerk, has been prepared to implement development strategies for the revitalization of the city's primary commercial corridors, namely Truman Street, San Fernando Road, Maclay Avenue, and First Street. The San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan (SP-5) covers approximately 150 acres generally located along both sides of Maclay Avenue, from Pico Street to the northerly terminus of the city, along both sides of San Fernando Road and Truman Street from the city's westerly boundary line at Hubbard Street to the city's easterly boundary line along Fox Street (including properties on the south side of Celis Street from Kalisher Street to Fox Street), and along both sides of First Street and the south side of Second Street between Hubbard and Hagar Streets. The area covered by the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan shall be established as the SP-5 San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan zone, and shall be designated on the zoning map by the designation "SP-5." 
The purpose of the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan (SP-5) is to put in place regulations and strategies to transform the city's downtown and adjacent supporting districts into attractive, livable, and economically vital places, preserving and enhancing existing industrial uses along First Street, and safeguarding existing, surrounding residential neighborhoods. The plan sets forth a policy framework, development standards, design guidelines, and an implementation program that includes capital improvements. The development standards are mandatory, while the design guidelines are recommendations that provide potential applicants and the city with a basis for proposing and reviewing development applications. 
The provisions of the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan (SP-5) are applicable to all properties within the specific plan area. The regulations, development standards, and design guidelines as contained in the San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan shall apply in their entirety to the review of development proposals. All other provisions of the Municipal Code continue to apply within the specific plan area except as expressly provided to the contrary in the San Fernando Specific Plan. Where San Fernando Corridors Specific Plan development standards and design guidelines do not provide adequate direction, the City of San Fernando Municipal Code shall prevail.

Sec. 106-823. - Computation of required parking spaces. 
(a)  When required parking spaces are based upon gross floor area, the floor area devoted exclusively to parking and maneuvering of vehicles shall not be considered in the computation. 
(b)  When, as a result of computation, the total number of parking spaces results in a fractional amount, any fraction less than one-half shall be disregarded, and any fraction equal to or greater than one-half shall require one parking space. 
(Ord. No. 1270, § 30.670.04, 9-30-1985; Ord. No. 1305, 6-15-1987)  
Sec. 106-824. - Parking spaces required for mixed uses. 
(a)  When there are two or more different uses located on the same lot or within the same building, the total number of parking spaces required shall equal the sum of requirements, including fractional amounts, for each use. The resulting sum shall then be rounded off to the nearest whole number pursuant to section 106-823. No parking space required for one use shall be considered as providing the required parking for any other use. However, for the area designated as the central business district in the land use element map of the general plan, parking spaces serving uses possessing unique and widely divergent operating hours, such that one use would not in its day-to-day operation have need of the parking spaces during the operating hours of the other use, may share those parking spaces with another use providing the area where the sharing occurs is not heavily impacted by a parking shortage as determined by the city engineer's parking study prepared and updated periodically for the city parking authority and provided: 
(1)  A shared parking agreement is developed between property owners and the agreement is submitted to the planning department for review prior to recording the agreement with the county recorder; and 
(2)  A copy of the recorded shared parking agreement is transmitted to the planning director prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(b)  Office space incidental to a manufacturing, warehouse or other industrial use shall have its required parking spaces computed at the same ratio as the industrial use, provided the office space does not exceed 20 percent of the total gross floor area. Office space in excess of 20 percent of the total gross floor area shall have its required parking spaces computed at the same ratio specified for office space. 
(Ord. No. 1270, § 30.670.05, 9-30-1985; Ord. No. 1305, 6-15-1987; Ord. No. 1456, § 1, 7-17-1995)  
Sec. 106-825. - Change in intensity. 
Whenever the intensity of use changes through a change in the number or quantity of dwelling units, floor area, employees, fixed seats or other units of measurement specified in this subdivision to determine the required parking, the number of required spaces shall be adjusted either upward or downward to reflect the change in intensity. 
(Ord. No. 1270, § 30.670.06, 9-30-1985; Ord. No. 1305, 6-15-1987)  
Sec. 106-826. - Change in use. 
Whenever there is a change in use resulting in a different parking requirement, the required spaces shall be adjusted either upward or downward to reflect the change in use. This section shall not apply to the conversion of manufacturing or warehouse floor area to office space, provided the total office space does not exceed 20 percent of the total gross floor area. 
(Ord. No. 1270, § 30.670.07, 9-30-1985; Ord. No. 1305, 6-15-1987)  
Sec. 106-827. - Location of parking. 
(a)  Parking spaces required for uses shall be located on the same lot as the use for which such spaces are provided. For nonresidential development, a variance may be granted to allow some or all of the required parking spaces to be located off site if facilities and/or in-lieu fees determined by city council resolution are provided instead of the required parking spaces. Conditions for granting a variance require findings that the variance will be an incentive to, and a benefit for, the proposed nonresidential development and that public transit facility is available for providing public transit patrons access to the nonresidential development. 
(b)  A nonresidential off-street parking lot may be permitted in a residential zone if the parking lot is located immediately adjacent to or across an alley, street, or easement from a nonresidential zoning district. 
(c)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, parking for new development or change in use intensity resulting from an enlargement of an existing building footprint occurring in the central business district, as defined in the city's general plan, may take place on the same and/or a different site under the same or different ownership as the use served, provided that the available parking is located within 500 feet of the use being served, measured from the nearest corner of the parking facility to the entrance of the use served via the shortest pedestrian route. Facilities used for off-site parking, except city parking lots, shall require a written agreement between property owners specifying the term of the agreement, the number of spaces to be provided, and the location of the parking facility. The agreement shall be submitted to the planning director for approval before it is recorded in the official records of the county, on title to the property where the off-site parking is being provided. A conformed copy of the recorded agreement shall be delivered to the planning director prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 1270, § 30.670.08, 9-30-1985; Ord. No. 1305, 6-15-1987; Ord. No. 1463, § 2, 3-4-1996)  
Sec. 106-828. - Provision for using city parking lots for on-site off-street parking facilities. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter to the contrary, off-street parking required of development consisting of either new construction or change in use intensity resulting from an enlargement of an existing building footprint taking place in the central business district, as defined in the general plan, may be provided by existing city parking lots through a written contract with the city. The contract shall: 
(1)  Designate the city parking lot number within the distance designated in section 106-827 and the number of off-site parking spaces to be credited to the development. In no case shall the number of credited parking spaces designated for a city parking lot exceed the actual number of available spaces. 
(2)  Prohibit the owner from utilizing the number of credited parking spaces in a city parking lot for any other use than that provided for in the contract. 
(3)  Provide that the credited parking spaces be conferred on a specified property and shall continue to apply to the property and shall not be transferable to another property by the owner who holds the credited parking spaces under the contract. 
(4)  Specify an appropriate cost per credited parking space to be paid the city by the owner of the property that has been given an entitlement to use credited parking spaces and specify the method of payment. 
(b)  For purposes of meeting the off-street parking requirements of this chapter, a contract meeting the requirements in subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed to be the equivalent of satisfying on-site off-street parking regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1463, § 3, 3-4-1996)  
Sec. 106-829. - Parking stall size. 
The minimum parking stall dimensions for required parking spaces shall not be less than that set forth as follows:

(a)  Outdoor parking facilities with 25 or more spaces shall include interior landscaping of not less than two percent of the area devoted to outdoor parking. Border plantings abutting a building, structure, sidewalk, wall or street shall not be considered interior landscaping. The two-percent interior landscaping shall be so arranged as to emphasize visual attractiveness as viewed by the public from surrounding streets and walkways. Such landscaping shall be maintained with an automatic irrigation system permanently and completely installed, which delivers water to all landscaped areas. 
(b)  Except where determined infeasible by the director, all interior areas of required outdoor parking facilities with 25 or more spaces which are unused as a result of the parking design and which are directly visible from a public street or walkway shall be landscaped and maintained with an automatic irrigation system permanently and completely installed, which delivers water directly to all landscaped areas. Such landscaping may be included in the computation of the two-percent interior landscaping requirement. 
(c)  Where a required parking facility is located adjacent to a public street or walkway, there shall be a landscaped strip not less than five feet in width running parallel to and along the street or walkway, excluding space devoted to driveways and other access points. The landscaped strip shall be maintained with an automatic irrigation system permanently and completely installed, which delivers water directly to all landscaped areas. Such landscaped strip shall not be included in the computation of the two-percent interior landscaping requirement of this section. Within such landscaped strip, there shall be erected along its interior edge, to the satisfaction of the director, a decorative wall or fence built to a height of three to 3½ feet. Ivy or other vining plant material shall be planted adjacent to any wall or fence and trained to grow up the fence or wall to protect the fence or wall from vandalism. This requirement may be met by providing a landscaped berm three to 3½ feet in height. The plant material shall not be permitted to grow over 3½ feet in height in the front yard. An automatic drip irrigation system shall be provided to adequately water the plant material. 
(d)  Any area required to be landscaped by this section shall have a well-balanced automatic irrigation system designed by a landscape architect or person competent in landscape design and shall be operated by electrically timed controller stations set for early morning irrigation.

(b)  The procedure in subsection (a) shall not apply to public nuisances constituting an imminent hazard. In such instances, the provisions in section 106-1157 shall be followed. 
(c)  The city's election to issue a notice of abatement pursuant to this section shall not excuse responsible persons from their continuing obligation to abate a public nuisance in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and legal requirements. Furthermore, the issuance of this notice of abatement shall not obligate the city to abate a public nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1148. - Additional requirements for demolition of buildings or structures. 
(a)  The city shall, excepting in cases involving an imminent hazard, provide responsible persons with a reasonable period to elect between options of repair, rehabilitation, or demolition, as well as a reasonable period of time to complete any of these options, before city personnel abate a public nuisance by demolishing a building or structure pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  The city shall, except in cases involving an imminent hazard, serve a notice of abatement on all secured lien holders of record with the county recorder's office in the event abatement actions include demolition of a building or structure. 
(c)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, entry onto any real property to abate a public nuisance by demolition of a building or structure, excepting in cases involving an imminent hazard, shall be pursuant to a warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The provisions of this section shall not apply if demolition is required to address an imminent hazard. In such situation, the provisions of section 106-1157 shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1149. - Service of notice of abatement. 
(a)  Except as otherwise expressly required by a provision of this chapter, any notice required by this chapter may be served by personal delivery to any responsible person or by both certified mail, return receipt requested and first class mail. The date of service shall be the date it is personally delivered or placed in a U.S. Postal Service receptacle. Failure of any responsible person to receive a properly addressed notice of abatement by mail shall not invalidate any action or proceeding pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  Except as otherwise expressly required by a provision of this chapter, any notice issued to an owner of real property shall be sent to the mailing address on the last equalized assessment roll of the county assessor's office. Failure of any owner to receive a properly addressed notice by mail shall not invalidate any action or proceeding pursuant to this chapter.

Sec. 106-1150. - Right of appeal from a notice of abatement.

(4)  Specific action or decision being appealed; 
(5)  Grounds for appeal in sufficient detail to enable the hearing officer to understand the nature of the controversy; 
(6)  The signature of at least one appellant. 
(c)  Failure of the city clerk to receive a timely appeal constitutes a waiver of the right to contest a notice of abatement. In this event, the notice of abatement is final and binding. 
(d)  The provisions of this section only apply to instances where the city has elected to establish the right, but not the obligation, to abate public nuisances with city personnel. In no event does this chapter limit the right of city officials to issue alternative written or oral notices of code violations to responsible persons or to cause the abatement of public nuisances in a different manner, including without limitation, by court orders arising from the city's exercise of its criminal or civil remedies. In such instances, a responsible person shall receive a right to hearing and other due process rights through the court process. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1151. - Sample notice of abatement.

___________ [City, State and Zip Code] 
Re: Real Property at ___________ , _______ 
L.A. County A.P.N.: ___________ 
Legal description [Optional]: ________ 
Notice is hereby given that the following public nuisance conditions or activities exist on the premises described above: 
(1)  [Describe condition or activities] ___________ in violation of San Fernando City Code [as well as county and state laws, if applicable] , Section(s) ________. 
(a)  Required Corrective Action(s): ___________ (with all required permits, approvals and inspections).

     [Repeat (1 a-b) for each additional public nuisance to be included in this notice] 
Please Take Notice that the foregoing public nuisance conditions are subject to abatement by rehabilitation, demolition, repair, removal or termination. 
Please Take Further Notice that city personnel may abate these public nuisance conditions or activities in the manner contained in this document if you do not perform the required corrective or preventative actions in a timely or proper manner with all required approvals, permits and inspections of the city and other appropriate public agencies. In such instances, the city shall seek recovery of all abatement costs, fees and expenses as allowed by the San Fernando City Code, or by applicable state laws, in any manner allowed by law. 
Please Take Further Notice that, in the event of abatement by city personnel, all personal property constituting a public nuisance may be removed from the subject premises or from public property and destroyed or disposed of, without regard to its actual or salvage value. 
Please Take Further Notice that, pursuant to §106-1165 of the San Fernando City Code, the city hereby elects to seek recovery of its attorneys' fees incurred in this action, and in any proceedings arising therefrom, to abate, or cause the abatement of, the public nuisance condition described herein. 
Please Take Further Notice that the city's election to issue this Notice of Intent to Abate does not excuse you from your continuing obligation to abate a public nuisance in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and legal requirements.

Please Take Further Notice that, if the violations are not abated within the time specified and a timely appeal is not made, such public nuisance may be abated by city employees, representatives or contract agents (hereafter "city personnel"), in the manner stated in this notice. On such occasions, all costs of the abatement, including, but not limited to, those stated in the city code, shall be assessed against you and/or the subject property, as a lien, or as a special assessment. 
Please Take Further Notice that the city may record a Notice of Substandard Property with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office against the premises if the public nuisance is not fully abated or corrected (with all required approvals, permits and inspections), as determined by the city, within a 30-day period after service of the Notice of Abatement and provided that a timely appeal therefrom has not been made.

[End of Form] 
(b)  A notice of abatement shall be deemed in substantial compliance with this subsection regardless of form if all substantive information is contained in such notice of abatement. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1152. - Consequence for an untimely appeal. 
(a)  If a timely appeal is not received by the city clerk, the right to appeal is waived and the notice of abatement is final and binding. In such instances, the city may, without any administrative hearing, cause the abatement with city forces of any or all of the public nuisance conditions or activities stated in the notice of abatement. Entry on improved private real property shall, excepting instances of an imminent hazard, be with an abatement warrant from the county superior court. The city shall follow the procedures stated in this chapter for recovery of all abatement costs, fees and expenses. 
(b)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall obligate the city to undertake abatement actions pursuant to a notice of abatement, whether or not there is a timely appeal. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1153. - Abatement by responsible person prior to hearing. 
(a)  Any responsible person shall have the right to abate a nuisance in accordance with the notice of abatement at his or her own expense, provided all corrective actions are completed with all required and applicable city permits, approvals and inspections, prior to the date the matter is set for a hearing. 
(b)  A hearing shall be cancelled if all public nuisance conditions or activities are, as determined by the city, fully and lawfully abated prior thereto. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1154. - Review by hearing officer. 
(a)  Any responsible person who contests a notice of abatement shall, subject to filing a timely appeal, obtain review thereof before a hearing officer. The administrative appeal shall be scheduled no later than 60 calendar days, and no sooner than ten calendar days, after receipt of a timely filed request for appeal. The appellants listed on the written request for an appeal shall be notified in writing of the date, time, and location of the hearing at least ten calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. 
(b)  Any request by an appellant to continue a hearing must be submitted to the city clerk in writing no later than two business days before the date scheduled for the hearing. The hearing officer may continue a hearing for good cause or on his/her own motion; however, in no event may the hearing be continued for more than 30 calendar days without stipulation by all parties. 
(c)  At the place and time set forth in the notification of appeal hearing, the hearing officer shall hear and consider the testimony of the appealing person(s), the issuing officer or city personnel, and/or their witnesses, as well as any documentary evidence presented by these persons concerning the alleged public nuisance(s). 
(d)  Appeal hearings are informal, and formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. The city bears the burden of proof to establish a public nuisance exists by a preponderance of evidence. The issuance of a notice of abatement shall constitute prima facie evidence of the violation and the code enforcement officer who issued the notice of abatement is not required to participate in the appeal hearing. The appellant, and the code enforcement officer issuing the notice of abatement, as well as all other responsible persons, shall have the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. The appellant and the enforcement officer issuing the notice of abatement, or other responsible persons, may represent himself/herself/themselves or be represented by anyone of his/her/their choice. The appellant, or other interested persons, may bring an interpreter to the hearing at his/ her/their sole expense. The city may, at its discretion, record the hearing by stenographer or court reporter, audio recording, or video recording. 
(e)  If the appellant fails, or other responsible persons fail, to appear, or to otherwise submit any admissible evidence demonstrating the non-existence of the alleged nuisance(s), the hearing officer shall cancel the hearing and send a notice thereof to the responsible person(s) by first class mail to the address(es) stated on the appeal form. A cancellation of a hearing due to non-appearance of the appellant shall constitute the appellant's waiver of the right to appeal. In such instances, the notice of abatement is final and binding. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1155. - Decision and notice by hearing officer. 
(a)  Within a reasonable time, not to exceed 15 calendar days following conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall determine if any nuisance condition exists at the subject property. If the hearing officer determines that each nuisance condition described in the notice of abatement is non-existent, the notice of abatement shall be deemed cancelled. If the hearing officer determines that one or more of the nuisance conditions described in the notice of abatement exists, he/she shall issue a written order of abatement which shall contain the following: 
(1)  A finding and description of each public nuisance condition at the subject property, or the non-existence thereof. In the latter instance, the hearing officer shall cancel the notice of abatement. 
(2)  The name of each person responsible for a public nuisance condition, or conditions, at the subject property, as well as the name of any appellant who is not responsible for said public nuisance condition(s).

(4)  Any other finding, determination or requirement that is relevant or related to the subject matter of the appeal. 
(b)  The decision of the hearing officer is final and conclusive. The decision shall also contain the following statement: 
"This decision is final and binding. Judicial review of this decision is subject to the provisions and time limits set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1094.6." 
(c)  A copy of the decision shall be served by first class mail on each responsible person to whom the notice of abatement was issued. If the owner is not an appellant, a copy of the order of abatement shall also be served on the owner by first class mail to the address shown on the last equalized assessment roll. Failure of a person to receive a properly addressed decision shall not invalidate any action or proceeding by the city pursuant to this chapter. 
(d)  The failure of any responsible person to comply with an order of abatement by completing each of the requisite corrective actions in the manner and time set forth in the order of abatement constitutes a misdemeanor offense. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1156. - Abatement of nuisance by responsible persons prior to city abatement actions. 
(a)  Any responsible person shall have the right to fully abate a public nuisance in accordance with the hearing officer's decision prior to the date of entry of city personnel upon the subject real property, provided that all corrective actions are completed with all city permits, approvals and inspections, prior to said entry date. In such instances, all administrative proceedings shall be cancelled with the exception of the city's right to seek recovery of its incurred incidental expenses, code enforcement fees, and attorney's fees as provided by and pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Once the city enters a subject real property to abate a public nuisance, it shall have the right to complete this action. 
(c)  It is unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person to obstruct, impede, or interfere with city personnel in the performance of any act that is carried out to abate a public nuisance.

Sec. 106-1157. - Emergency action to abate an imminent hazard. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any provision of the city code to the contrary, the police chief, the fire chief, or the building official, or any of their designees, may cause a public nuisance to be summarily abated if it is determined that the nuisance creates an imminent hazard to a person or persons, or to other real or personal property. 
(b)  Prior to abating the public nuisance, the city administrator or their designee may attempt to notify a responsible person by telephone or in writing of the imminent hazard and request its abatement by said person. The city administrator or their designee may, at his/her discretion, dispense with an attempt of prior notification of a responsible person if the nature or severity of the hazard justifies such inaction. If, in the sole discretion of the city personnel declaring an imminent hazard, the responsible person(s) fail(s) to take immediate and meaningful steps to abate the imminent hazard, the city may abate the public nuisance with city personnel, and charge the costs and fees associated with said abatement to the responsible person(s). 
(c)  Within ten business days following emergency actions of city personnel to abate an imminent hazard, the city shall serve any responsible person with a notice of emergency abatement by city personnel of an imminent hazard by both certified mail, return receipt requested and first class mail. The city may, if a responsible person is a property owner, rely on that person's mailing address according to the last equalized assessment roll of the county assessor's office in determining a service address for this notice. Failure of any responsible person to receive a notice of emergency abatement by city personnel of an imminent hazard by mail shall not invalidate any action or proceeding pursuant to this chapter. 
(d)  A notice of emergency abatement by city personnel of an imminent hazard shall contain the following provisions: 
(1)  The name of all known responsible persons who are being served with the notice of emergency abatement by city personnel of an imminent hazard and the address of the real property on which the imminent hazard was present. 
(2)  A brief description of the condition(s) and reasons why it constitutes an imminent hazard. 
(3)  A brief description of the law prohibiting or pertaining to the imminent hazard. 
(4)  A brief description of the actions city personnel took to abate the imminent hazard. 
(e)  Omission of any of the foregoing provisions in a notice of emergency abatement by city personnel of an imminent hazard, whether in whole or in part, or the failure of a responsible person to receive this document, shall not render it defective or render any proceeding or action pursuant to this chapter invalid. 
(f)  Emergency abatement of an imminent hazard by city personnel shall not preclude the city from recording a notice of substandard property in accordance with the provisions of section 106-1163, if conditions thereafter remain at the premises that constitute a violation of law or a public nuisance. 
(g)  The city shall be entitled to recover its fees and costs (incidental or otherwise) for the abatement of an imminent hazard. In such instances, the city shall follow the procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1158. - Combination of notices. 
The notices that are authorized by this chapter may be combined in the discretion of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)

(b)  The city shall serve a statement of abatement costs on the responsible persons within 90 calendar days of the city's completion of nuisance abatement actions. Service of this statement may be made in the manner provided for in section 106-1149 of this division. 
(c)  Unless a timely contest of statement of abatement costs is filed, a responsible person shall tender the costs in U.S. currency to the city within 30 calendar days of the date of service of the statement of abatement costs. Alternatively, a responsible person may contest the statement in the manner provided for in subsection (d). 
(d)  A responsible person has the right to contest a statement of abatement costs by filing a written request for contest on a completed city form with the city clerk within ten calendar days of service of the notice of abatement. 
(1)  A written request for contest shall contain the following information: 
a.  Name, address, telephone number, and signature of each responsible person who is contesting the statement of abatement costs; 
b.  Address and description of the real property upon which the city abated a public nuisance; 
c.  Date of the statement of abatement costs being contested; 
d.  Description of the specific abatement cost being contested, and a statement of the grounds for contest in sufficient detail to enable the city council to understand the nature of the controversy. 
(2)  No fee shall be due for the filing of a request for contest. 
(e)  Failure of the city clerk to receive a timely contest constitutes a waiver of the right to contest a statement of abatement costs. In this event, the statement of abatement costs is final and binding, and the city may proceed to collect the costs as contained in a final statement of abatement costs in any manner allowed by law. 
(f)  If a timely appeal is received by the city clerk, a hearing shall be set before the city council no later than 60 calendar days, and no sooner than ten calendar days, of receipt of the request for contest. A notice of the date, time and location of the hearing shall be served on all responsible persons who contested the statement of abatement costs by first class mail to the address(es) stated on the appeal form at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. Failure of a person to receive a properly addressed notice shall not invalidate any action or proceeding by the city pursuant to this chapter. 
(g)  Any request by an appellant to continue a hearing must be submitted to the city clerk in writing no later than five business days before the date scheduled for the hearing. The city council may continue a hearing for good cause or on its own motion; however, in no event may the hearing be continued for more 60 calendar days without stipulation by all parties. 
(h)  At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the request to contest the statement of abatement costs, the city council shall hear and pass upon the evidence submitted by city personnel, together with any objections or protests raised by responsible persons liable for said costs. Testimony and evidence shall be limited to issues related to the abatement costs, and no person shall be permitted to present evidence or testimony challenging the existence of a public nuisance or manner of abatement as described in the notice of abatement. Thereupon, the city council may make such revision, correction or modification to the statement as it may deem just, after which the statement, as it is submitted, or as revised, corrected or modified, shall be confirmed. The hearing may be continued from time to time. 
(i)  The decision of the city council is final. 
(j)  The city clerk shall cause a confirmed statement of abatement costs to be served upon all responsible persons who contested the original statement by first class mail to the address(es) stated on the appeal form. The city clerk shall also cause a confirmed statement of abatement costs to be served on the owner of the property on which city personnel abated a public nuisance by first class mail to the address shown on the last equalized assessment roll (irrespective of whether the owner contested the statement of abatement costs). This document shall also contain the following statement: 
"This decision is final and binding. Judicial review of the city's council's decision is subject to the provisions and time limits set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1094.6." 
Failure of a person to receive a properly addressed confirmed statement shall not invalidate any action or proceeding by the city pursuant to this chapter. 
(k)  A responsible person shall tender the costs in U.S. currency to the city within 30 calendar days of the date of service of the confirmed statement of abatement costs. The city may thereafter proceed to collect the costs as contained in the confirmed statement of abatement costs in any manner allowed by law.

Sec. 106-1160. - Collection of costs of abatement by special assessment. 
(a)  The city may cause a special assessment to be made upon real property upon which a public nuisance was abated pursuant to California Government Code, § 38775.5, and future amendments thereto, in the event a statement of abatement costs or a confirmed statement of abatement costs is not paid in a timely manner. 
(b)  A notice of special assessment shall be sent to the owner(s) of the subject real property by certified mail at the time the assessment is the imposed that shall contain the following recitals: 
The property may be sold after three years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. The tax collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary city taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary city taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of city taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
(c)  The city attorney or city prosecutor shall establish the notice of special assessment form for use, or consideration by, the county tax collector in collecting a special assessment. 
(d)  The notice of special assessment shall be entitled to recordation with the county recorder's office.

(b)  A lien shall not be recorded prior to serving the owner of record of the parcel of land on which the public nuisance is maintained, with a notice. This document shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with § 415.10) of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. If the owner of record, after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten calendar days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the property is located pursuant to California Government Code § 6062. 
(c)  The nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded in the county recorder's office in the county in which the parcel of land is located and from the date of recording shall have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien. 
(d)  A nuisance abatement lien authorized by this section shall specify the amount of the lien for the City of San Fernando, the name of the city department(s) on whose behalf the lien is imposed, the date of the abatement actions, the street address, legal description and assessor's parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel.

(f)  A nuisance abatement lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by the city for a money judgment. 
(g)  The city may recover from the property owner any of the costs incurred regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien. 
(h)  The amount of a nuisance abatement lien shall also constitute a personal obligation of the property owners of land upon which the public nuisance was abated. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1162. - Triple the costs of abatement. 
Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two-year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a public nuisance pursuant to this chapter, the court may order that person to pay triple the costs of the abatement. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1163. - Recordation of substandard notice. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any provision of the city code to the contrary, if the city determines that any property, building or structure, or any part thereof, is in violation of any provision of the city code and said violation has not been fully abated or corrected, as determined by the city, within a 30-calendar day period after written notice to a responsible person, then the city, in its sole discretion, may record a notice of substandard property with the county recorder's office against said premises. As used herein, "fully abated or corrected" includes the procurement of all required city approvals, permits, licenses and the passage of all city required inspections. 
(b)  The city may record a notice of substandard property without the issuance of a notice of abatement pursuant to section 106-1149 of this chapter, provided that a notice of correction or a notice of violation to a responsible person previously disclosed that a substandard notice may be recorded against a property if a violation is not fully abated or corrected in a period of 30 calendar days. 
(c)  A notice of substandard property may be recorded 30 days after service of a notice of abatement provided that: 
(1)  The notice contained this disclosure; 
(2)  The public nuisance was not fully abated or corrected within that period; and 
(3)  A timely and proper appeal to the notice of abatement was not made. 
(d)  The form that constitutes a notice of substandard property shall be approved by the city attorney or the city prosecutor. 
(e)  The city shall record a notice of rescission of substandard property with the county recorder's office within ten business days of its determination that a violation or a public nuisance has been fully abated or corrected. 
(f)  The city shall cause copies of recorded notices of substandard property and notices of rescission of substandard property to be served on all persons having an ownership interest in the subject real property as shown in the last equalized assessment roll of the county assessor's office. Service thereof shall be by first class mail. Failure of any person to receive such notices shall not invalidate any action or proceeding pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1596, §§ 4, 5, 1-19-2010)  
Sec. 106-1164. - Code enforcement fees. 
(a)  Pursuant to California Health and Safety Code § 17951, and any successor statute thereto, responsible persons, who cause, allow, permit, suffer or maintain a violation in, or upon, residential properties, shall be charged code enforcement fees, by the city to defray its costs of code enforcement actions, as defined in section 106-1142 of this chapter. Such fees shall not exceed the amount reasonably required to achieve this objective and are chargeable whether the city's code enforcement actions occur in the absence of formal administrative or judicial proceedings, as well as prior to, during, or subsequent to, the initiation of such proceedings. 
(b)  The amount(s) or rate(s) of code enforcement fees for city personnel time and other resources that are used for code enforcement actions shall be established, and may thereafter be amended, by resolution by the city council.

(a)  A prevailing party in any administrative, civil or equitable judicial action to abate, or cause the abatement of a public nuisance as defined in this chapter, or in any appeal or other judicial action arising therefrom, may recover reasonable attorney's fees in accordance with the following subsections: 
(1)  Attorney's fees are not recoverable by any person as a prevailing party unless the city administrator, or a designee thereof, or an attorney for, and on behalf of, the city, elects in writing to seek recovery of the city's attorney fees at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding. Failure to make such an election precludes any entitlement to, or award of, attorney's fees in favor of any person or the city. 
(2)  The city is the prevailing party when an administrative or judicial determination is made or affirmed by which a person is found to be responsible for one or more conditions or activities that constitute a public nuisance. A person is the prevailing party only when a final administrative or judicial determination completely absolves that person of responsibility for all conditions or activities that were alleged, in that action or proceeding, to constitute a public nuisance. An administrative or judicial determination that results in findings of responsibility and non-responsibility on the part of a person for conditions or activities that were alleged in that action or proceeding to constitute a public nuisance, shall nevertheless result in the city being the prevailing party. 
(b)  Provided that the city has made an election to seek attorney's fees, an award of attorney's fees to a person shall not exceed the amount of reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the city in that action or proceeding.

(Ord. No. 1583, § 4, 11-17-2008)  
Sec. 106-1389. - Procedure for designating a structure of merit. 
Structures of merit may be designated by the commission in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  Any person may request the designation of an improvement as a structure of merit by properly filing with the director an application for such designation. Additionally, the commission may file an application for the designation of a structure of merit on its own motion. Within 30 days of filing an application, the property owner and tenants of the subject property shall be notified of the application filing. 
(2)  Upon the proper filing of an application, the removal or demolition, in whole or in part, of a proposed structure of merit is prohibited. No permit shall be issued by any city department, board or commission including, but not limited to, any entitlements authorizing any such removal or demolition, while any action on the application or any appeal related thereto, is pending. 
(3)  The director shall conduct an evaluation of the proposed designation and shall make a recommendation to the commission as to whether the structure merits such designation. The commission shall meet pursuant to section 2-72 of this Code within 60 days of filing of an application to determine whether the structure merits such designation.

Sec. 106-1390. - Criteria for rescinding or amending a historic resource, historic district, or structure of merit designation. 
The city council may consider rescinding or amending the designation of a historic resource, historic district, or structure of merit upon request by a majority of affected property owners, by a recommendation of the commission, or by motion of a majority of the city council. In rescinding the designation of a historic resource, historic district or structure of merit the city council shall determine that the historic resource, historic district, or structure of merit no longer meets the designation criteria due to any of the following findings of fact that: 
(1)  Destruction of the historic resource or structure of merit through a catastrophic event has rendered the historic resource or structure of merit a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare; 
(2)  The historic resource, historic district or structure of merit no longer conforms to any of the criteria identified in section 106-1385 of this Code; 
(3)  There is a clear and convincing evidence that the historic significance of the historic resource, historic district or structure of merit has diminished and is no longer significant; or 
(4)  The historic resource or structure of merit cannot be restored, rehabilitated, stabilized or renovated for any use permitted in the zone in which it is located without causing an economic hardship disproportionate to the historic value of the historic resource or structure of merit as substantiated by clear and convincing evidence. Proof of economic hardship shall require a showing that the cost of stabilization of the historic fabric of the property or properties exceeds the appraised value as determined by a qualified appraiser of the historic improvements on the site or in the district through a hardship waiver application. If the appraised value of the historic improvements on a historic site is less than 75 percent of the average value of similarly sized buildings within a 500-foot radius, the average appraised value of property improvements in the radius area shall be used. For properties where neighborhood standards are not comparable, standard real estate practice comparable worth studies shall be produced to justify the burden of stabilization as compared to property value. The city council shall consider the value of property tax incentives allowed by this division and other benefits as may be available for historic preservation or stabilization in determining if economic hardship exists to the extent that removal of the designation status of an historic resource is warranted. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 4, 11-17-2008)

Sec. 106-1396. - Hardship waiver. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to address circumstances in which the applicant for a proposed project to alter or demolish, in whole or in part, a historic resource, contributing structure, or structure of merit, asserts that full compliance with all of the requirements of this division would create an undue economic hardship, or is infeasible for other specific reasons. Under such circumstances, a project feasibility assessment shall be required to determine the nature and extent of the economic or other hardship, and to assess the impact of the proposed project on the community's historic resources. A hardship waiver of specified requirements of this division for the proposed project may be approved subject to the standards and procedures in this section. 
(b)  Criteria for approval of a hardship waiver. 
(1)  For an income producing property that is an historic resource, contributing structure, or structure of merit, the basis for approval of a hardship waiver exempting a project to alter or demolish the property, in whole or in part, from full compliance with the requirements of this division shall be that a reasonable rate of return cannot be obtained from the property if altered in a manner consistent with the requirements of this division, or in its present condition, and that the proposed project will not have a significant adverse impact on the community's historic resources. 
(2)  For a non-income producing property that is an historic resource, contributing structure, or structure of merit, the basis for approval of a hardship waiver exempting a project to alter or demolish the property, in whole or in part, from full compliance with the requirements of this division shall be that the property no longer provides beneficial public, private or institutional benefit to the community, and that that the proposed project will not have a significant adverse impact on the community's historic resources. Non-income producing properties shall consist of owner-occupied dwellings or properties owned by institutional, non-profit organizations, or public entities. 
(3)  The following circumstances shall not be considered as contributing to the basis for approval of a hardship waiver: 
a.  Willful or negligent acts by the property owners or managers; 
b.  Purchase of the property for substantially more than market value; 
c.  Failure to perform ordinary maintenance and repairs; 
d.  Failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants; 
e.  Failure to provide normal tenant improvements; or 
f.  Failure to accept an offer of purchase of the property at fair market value from a party willing to dedicate a conservation easement for the preservation of the property. 
(c)  Procedures for approval of a hardship waiver. 
(1)  Application: The applicant shall complete the application provided by the director, include all information required, and pay any required fee. The property owner seeking a project approval under a hardship waiver must provide information as necessary to support the application for a hardship determination. The director shall maintain a written policy statement identifying the types of submittal materials required for the consideration of a hardship waiver. Different submittal materials may be required depending upon the property's use and circumstances. Necessary studies, evaluations and the compilation of information as required by the director shall be provided at the waiver applicant's expense. 
(2)  Review process: Upon receiving an application for a hardship waiver, the director shall provide a written response describing the submittal materials required to consider the request pursuant to the following procedure: 
a.  Upon receipt of an application and required submittal materials, the director shall determine its completeness. If the director determines that the application is not complete, the applicant will be notified in writing as to the deficiencies. The director will take no further steps to process the application until the deficiencies have been remedied. 
b.  Upon receipt of a completed application, the director shall conduct an evaluation of the proposed designation and shall make a recommendation to the commission as to whether a hardship waiver is justified for the proposed project. The commission shall meet pursuant to section 2-72 of this Code to consider whether a hardship waiver is justified for the proposed project. If the proposed project is to demolish, in whole or in part, a historic resource, contributing structure, or structure of merit, all property owners within 500 feet of the project location shall be notified at least ten days prior to the meeting. 
c.  If the commission determines that a hardship waiver is not justified for the proposed project, the project applicant and all owners of the subject property shall be notified of such determination, and the process shall terminate; except that any person may appeal the commission's decision to the city council within ten days of the commission's determination, per the procedure provided in section 106-77 of this Code. 
d.  If the commission determines that a hardship waiver for the proposed project is justified, or justified with conditions, the director shall schedule the matter for consideration by the city council and submit a written report to the city council incorporating the commission's recommendation and its reasons in support of the proposed hardship waiver. If the proposed project is to demolish, in whole or in part, a historic resource, contributing structure or structure of merit, all property owners within 500 feet of the project location shall be notified at least ten days prior to the meeting. 
e.  If the city council approves, or approves with conditions, a hardship waiver for a proposed project, it shall make findings of fact and determinations in writing subject to the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act. 
f.  If a hardship waiver is approved for a project to demolish, in whole or in part, a historic resource, contributing structure, or structure of merit, the project applicant may be required to take measures including, but not limited to, the following prior to any demolition: 
1.  Document the site, structures, buildings or objects that are to be demolished, using the Historic American Buildings Survey and/or the Historic American Engineering Record standards when determined to be applicable by the director; and

(2)  State Historical Building Code. Whenever applicable, the property owner may elect to use the State Historical Building Code for alteration, restoration, new construction, removal, relocation, or demolition of a historic resource, in any case which the building official determines that such use of the code does not endanger the public health or safety, and such action is necessary for the continued preservation of an historic resource. Such use of the code is subject to construction work undertaken for historical resources pursuant to the secretary's standards, and that has already been reviewed and approved by the commission and/or city council in conjunction with a certificate of appropriateness. 
(3)  Parking reduction for historic resources. Addition of floor area to a residential building designated as an historic resource of up to 25 percent shall be exempt from the requirements of subsection 106-822(a) of this Code if such addition is determined by the director to preserve or enhance the historical features of the structure.

(a)  Designated structures. A structure designated as an historic resource, contributing structure, or structure of merit shall not be demolished or relocated unless the city council, pursuant to the procedure for approval of a hardship waiver, and subsequent to a recommendation by the commission, makes one or more of the following findings of fact at a public hearing: 
(1)  Based upon sufficient evidence, including evidence provided by the applicant, the property retains no reasonable economic use, taking into account the condition of the structure, its location, the current market value, and the costs of rehabilitation to meet the requirements of the building code or other city, state or federal law. 
(2)  That the demolition or relocation of the structure is necessary to proceed with a project consistent with and supportive of identified goals and objectives of the general plan, and the demolition of the structure will not have a significant effect on the achievement of the purposes of this division or the potential effect is outweighed by the benefits of the new project. 
(3)  In the case of an application for a permit to relocate, that the structure may be moved without destroying its historic or architectural integrity and importance. 
(4)  That the demolition or relocation of the historic resource is necessary to protect or to promote the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the city, including the need to eliminate or avoid blight or nuisance.

(1)  Based upon sufficient evidence, including evidence provided by the applicant, the property retains no reasonable economic use, taking into account the condition of the structure, its location, the current market value, and the costs of rehabilitation to meet the requirements of the building code or other city, state or federal law; 
(2)  That the demolition or relocation of the structure is necessary to proceed with a project consistent with and supportive of identified goals and objectives of the general plan, and the demolition of the structure will not have a significant effect on the achievement of the purposes of this division or the potential effect is outweighed by the benefits of the new project; 
(3)  In the case of an application for a permit to relocate, that the structure may be moved without destroying its historic or architectural integrity and importance; or, 
(4)  That the demolition or relocation of the structure is necessary to protect or to promote the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the city, including the need to eliminate or avoid blight or nuisance.

Sec. 106-1450. - Findings and declaration of intent. 
(a)  The California Legislature in section 65864 of the Government Code has found that the lack of certainty in the approval of development projects can result in a waste of resources, escalate the cost of other development to the consumer, and discourage investment in and commitment to comprehensive planning which would make maximum efficient utilization of resources at the least economic cost to the public. 
(b)  The city council finds and determines that the public safety, health, convenience, comfort, prosperity, and general welfare will be furthered by the adoption of this division in order to provide a mechanism for the enactment of development agreements in order to implement various goals and objectives of the city's general plan and to provide flexibility for the implementation of certain development project approvals for the development of particular projects and to provide a mechanism for allowing expenditures to respond selectively to development proposals, including assurances of adequate public facilities at the time of development, proper timing and sequencing of development, effective capital improvement programming to accomplish the foregoing purposes and aims and the realization of the benefits to be derived therefrom.

The development agreement shall not be binding or enforceable prior to the effective date of the ordinance approving the development agreement and execution of the development agreement by all parties thereto. 
Because a development agreement is also a contract which requires the consent of each party in order to become binding, the city council reserves the right to disapprove entering into any development agreement, regardless of the provisions hereof, and the ordinance shall be advisory only and shall not require the acceptance of any development agreement.

Sec. 106-1470. - Coordination of development agreement application with other discretionary approvals. 
It is the intent of this division and chapter that the application for a development agreement will be made and considered simultaneously with the review of other necessary applications, including, but not limited to rezoning, variance, planned commercial, or industrial development and conditional use permits. If combined with an application for rezoning, planned development or conditional use permit, the application for a development agreement shall be submitted with said application and shall be processed, to the maximum extent possible, jointly to avoid duplication of hearings and repetition of information. A development agreement is not a substitute for, nor an alternative to, any other required permit or approval, and the qualified applicant or developer must comply with all other required procedures for development approval. 
(Ord. No. 1637, § 3, 11-17-2014)  
Sec. 106-1471. - Time for and initiation of review.
