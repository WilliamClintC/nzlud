ARTICLE II
Accessory Apartments and Apartment Units
[Adopted 11-16-2000; amended 10-3-2002]
§ 9-12. Intent and purpose.
The intent of this article is to provide an opportunity to bring into
compliance many of the currently unpermitted accessory apartments
and apartment units in the Town of Barnstable, as well as to allow the
construction of new dwelling units accessory to existing single-family
homes to create additional affordable housing.
A.
This article recognizes that although unpermitted and unlawfully
occupied, these dwelling units are filling a market demand for housing
at rental costs typically below that of units which are and have been
lawfully constructed and occupied.
B.
It is in the public interest and in concert with its obligations under state
law, for the Town of Barnstable to offer a means by which so-called
unpermitted and illegal dwelling units can achieve lawful status, but
only in the manner described below.
C.
It is the position of the Town of Barnstable that the most appropriate
mechanism for allowing for the conversion of unlawful dwelling units
to lawful units is found in MGL c. 40B, §§ 20 to 23, the so-called
"Comprehensive Permit" program. This provision of state law
encourages the development of low- and moderate-income rental and
owner-occupied housing and provides a means for the Board of Appeals
to remove local barriers to the creation of affordable housing units.
These barriers include any local regulation such as zoning and general
ordinances that may be an impediment to affordable housing
development.
D.
The Local Comprehensive Plan states that the Town should commit
appropriate resources to support affordable housing initiatives. Under
this article, the Town commits the following resources to support this
affordable housing initiative:
Waiver of fees for the inspection and monitoring of the properties
identified under this article;
(1)
Designation of Town staff to assist the property owner in navigating
through the process established under this article;
(2)
To the extent allowable by law, the negative effect entailed by
the deed restriction involved will be reflected in the property tax
assessment; and
(3)
To assist property owners in locating available municipal, state
and federal funds for rehabilitating and upgrading the properties
identified under this article.

E.
§ 9-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 9-12

§ 9-13. Creation of local Chapter 40B program.
As part of the Town's efforts to create the type of affordable housing that
best meets the needs of the Town and its residents, the Town Manager and
staff designated by the Town Manager shall establish a screening process
and criteria for the preexisting and unpermitted units described herein, as
well as for the construction of new units accessory to single-family homes,
as part of a local Chapter 40B program which program will provide the state
or federal subsidy necessary to establish standing under Chapter 40B for
units being created and/or permitted.
§ 9-14. Amnesty program.
Recognizing that the success of this article depends, in part, on the
admission by real property owners that their property may be in violation
of the Zoning Ordinances of the Town,2 the Town hereby establishes the
following amnesty program:
The Local Comprehensive Plan supports, in conjunction with a variety
of other strategies, the conversion of existing structures for use as
affordable housing.
F.
Through the creation of a local Chapter 40B program, which uses state
and federal subsidies, the Town can create a mechanism to utilize
existing structures and to construct new accessory structures for the
creation of affordable housing units that is consistent with the Town's
identified housing needs.
G.
The threshold criteria for units being considered as units potentially
eligible for the amnesty program are:
Real property containing a dwelling unit or dwelling units for which
there does not exist a validly issued variance, special permit or
building permit, does not qualify as a lawful, nonconforming use or
structure, for any or all the units, and that was in existence on a lot
of record within the Town as of January 1, 2000; or
(1)
Real property containing a dwelling unit or dwelling units which
were in existence as of January 1, 2000, and which have been cited
by the Building Department as being in violation of the Zoning
Ordinance; and
(2)
The property owner has the burden of demonstrating to the
Building Commissioner that the criteria in either Subsection A(1)
and/or (2) have been satisfied.
(3)
If any dwelling unit or units identified herein are occupied during
the period of time when amnesty is in effect, said unit must be
inspected by the entity designated by the Town Manager and found

shown on a map entitled Map of Approach Zones, Barnstable Municipal
Airport, Hyannis, Massachusetts, dated February 1, 1957.
AIRPORT HAZARD — Any structure or tree which extends to any airport
approach zone.
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY — The Town Manager of the Town of

occupants of the land in its vicinity, and effects a reduction of the area
available for the landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus
tending to impair the utility of the airport and the public investment therein.
Accordingly, it is necessary in the interests of public health, safety and
general welfare that the creating, establishment or maintenance of airport
hazards be prevented by exercise of police power, without compensation to
any person, except as herein specifically provided.

hereby established as shown and indicated on the map referred to in § 13-2.
§ 13-5. Nonconforming structures and trees.
The limitation prescribed in this chapter shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or
tree not conforming to these regulations as of the effective date thereof

use. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to permit any such
nonconforming structure or tree to be substantially altered or repaired,
rebuilt, allowed to grow or replanted so as to become a greater hazard to

administrative agency charged with the duty of administering and enforcing
the regulations herein prescribed. The duties of such agency shall include

permit the growth of any tree, in a manner not conforming to the airport
approach protection regulations as herein established, or to establish the
right to do so may apply to the Town Manager for a variance from the

practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would
not be contrary to public interest. Any permit or variance granted under
this section shall be conditioned as to require the owner of the structure
or tree to permit the Barnstable Municipal Airport at its own expense to
install, operate and maintain suitable obstruction markings or obstruction
lights thereon.

ALARM SYSTEMS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Noncriminal disposition — See Ch. 1, Art. I.
§ 17-1. Purpose.
Advances in technology have engendered the creation and deployment of
sophisticated systems using a variety of protocols to monitor premises and
persons and activities on them, and to generate signals of various types to
which the Police Department is expected to respond. When these systems
work properly in a coordinated system, they can be a significant aid to
safe and efficient law enforcement. When they do not work properly, they

§ 78-1. Purposes and intent.
§ 78-2. Applicability.
§ 78-3. Statutory authority.
This chapter is adopted as implementing regulations pursuant to and as
authorized by the Fertilizer Management District of Critical Planning
Excessive nutrient enrichment of the region's groundwaters and
surface waters may have significant public health ramifications,
including direct detrimental effects on drinking water sources by
increased concentrations of nitrates that can violate safe drinking
water standards, and have negative impacts on economic,
environmental and recreational resources and values in the Town and
region.
A.
The Town has significant glacially deposited sandy soils that are subject
to rapid water infiltration, percolation, and leaching of nutrients.
B.
This chapter incorporates by reference the University of Massachusetts
Extension's Turf Management Best Management Practices. These
practices, if followed, are deemed to protect the public health, safety
and welfare and aid in achieving compliance with the total maximum
daily loads (TMDL) for the Town's water resources prescribed by the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts while allowing reasonable use of
fertilizers for the enhancement and maintenance of turf quality.
C.
This chapter provides for a reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus
entering the Town's waters and wetlands by means of an organized
system of education, certification, standardization and regulation of
practice. This chapter is not intended to eliminate the use of fertilizer.
A.
This chapter adopts the best management practices as the normal
operating procedures for turf management but not plants other than
turf.

§ 78-5. Standards of performance.
§ 78-4 BARNSTABLE CODE § 78-5
68:100
Best management practices. The best management practices (BMP), as
defined herein, shall be applied to the standards of performance.
A.
Performance standards for noncertified fertilizer applicators. Fertilizer
applicators who do not hold fertilizer certification issued in accordance
with § 78-6B of this chapter shall comply with the following standards
for fertilizer applications to turf:
Noncertified fertilizer applicators shall not apply fertilizer during
or immediately prior to heavy rainfall, such as but not limited to
thunderstorms, hurricanes, or northeastern storms, or when the
soil is saturated due to intense or extended rainfall;
(1)
Noncertified fertilizer applicators shall not apply fertilizer or
compost between November 12 and the following March 31;
(2)
Noncertified fertilizer applicators shall not apply, spill, or deposit
fertilizer on any impervious surface and fail to remove the applied,
spilled, or deposited fertilizer immediately (and in which case the
applicator shall then either contain, dispose of legally or apply the
fertilizer as allowed), and shall not apply, spill or deposit fertilizer
in a manner that allows fertilizer to enter into storm drains;
(3)
Unless the Town's existing laws and regulations, including its
Wetland Ordinance or Regulations, contain a stricter standard or
other enforcement or approval mechanism such as through the
Town's Conservation Commission, which shall control, noncertified
fertilizer applicators shall not apply fertilizer closer than 100 feet
to any water body, or within the Zone I of a public drinking water
well unless permission is obtained through the enforcement
authority set out in § 78-6D(1) herein allowing such activity;
(4)
A noncertified fertilizer applicator shall not apply fertilizer that
contains phosphorus, unless a soil test taken not more than three

§ 108-1. Findings.
Exposure to hazardous substances can cause cancer, genetic mutation,
birth defects, miscarriages, lung, liver, and kidney damage, and death.
A.
Environmental contamination can bankrupt site owners, lower or
destroy land values, drive out residents and industry, depress local
economies, and endanger public health.
B.
Most hazardous substances do not readily decompose into harmless
components. They instead remain in highly dangerous forms and
penetrate by movement through land and water into and throughout
the environment.
C.
Some hazardous substances are considered explosive and/or extremely
hazardous and toxic. These substances have caused death and serious
injuries to Fire Department personnel. A comprehensive database
containing the types and amounts of toxic or hazardous materials
stored or handled within buildings within the Town should be formed in
order to provide essential information to Fire Department personnel.
D.
Barnstable's groundwater is the sole source of its existing and future
drinking water supply. When sufficient groundwater exists to saturate
a permeable geologic formation so as to yield significant quantities of
water through wells or springs, it is known as an aquifer.
E.
On Cape Cod, some aquifers may be integral with the surface waters,
lakes, streams and coastal estuaries which constitute significant
recreational and economic resources of the Town. These resources are
used for swimming and other water-related recreation, shellfishing and
fishing.
F.
Accidental spills and discharges of petroleum products and other toxic
and hazardous materials onto the ground and surface waters have
repeatedly threatened the quality of such groundwater supplies and
related water resources on Cape Cod and other Massachusetts towns,
G.
§ 104-6 BARNSTABLE CODE § 108-1
108:126
§ 108-2. Authority.
The Town of Barnstable adopts the following measures under its home rule
powers, its police powers to protect the public health and welfare, and its
authorization under M.G.L. Chapter 40, § 21.
§ 108-3. Definitions.
posing substantial public health and safety hazards and threatening
economic losses to the affected communities.
Unless stricter preventive measures are adopted to manage the
storage, use, and generation of toxic and hazardous materials and
to prohibit the release of these materials within the Town, further
releases of such materials to the aquifer will predictably occur, and
with greater frequency and degree of hazard by reason of increasing
construction, commercial and industrial development, population, and
vehicular traffic in the Town of Barnstable and on Cape Cod.
H.
The foregoing conclusions are well known and have been confirmed by
findings set forth by the Barnstable County Health and Environmental
Department, the Cape Cod Commission, the Massachusetts Department
of Environmental Protection, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), and the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA).
I.
Recent revisions to the Massachusetts Drinking Water Regulations, 310
CMR 22.00, created the need for this chapter to be amended in order
to remove potential conflicts between this chapter and 310 CMR 22.00.

In rendering a decision on an application as described herein, the
Commission shall consider, among other factors, the historic and
architectural value and significance of the landmark, the general
design, arrangement, texture and material of the features involved, and
the relation of such features to similar features in the surrounding
area. In the case of new construction or additions to existing structures

Commission shall be in conformity with the provisions of § 11 of Chapter

of the General Laws for a violation of said chapter, except that no such fine
shall exceed $300. In addition to the foregoing, no building permit shall

H.
Except as this article may otherwise provide, no building, structure,
setting or part thereof within the district shall be constructed,
demolished, moved or altered in any way that affects any exterior

I.
Any person who desires to obtain a certificate from the Commission
shall file with the Commission an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, a certificate of nonapplicability, or a certificate of
hardship, as the case may be, in such form as the Commission may
reasonably determine. The application shall be accompanied by such
plans, elevations, specifications, photographs, paint color samples, or
other materials or information the Commission deems necessary to
make a determination on the application. In the case of a demolition or
removal, an evaluation of the property condition and appearance shall
be included. The date of the filing of an application shall be the date on
which a copy of such application is received by the Commission.
A.
The Commission, or a delegate thereof, shall determine promptly, and
in all events within 14 days after the filing of an application for a
certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of nonapplicability, or a
certificate of hardship, as the case may be, whether the application
involves any exterior architectural or site features that are subject to
review by the Commission.
B.
If the Commission, or a delegate thereof, determines that an application
for a certificate does not involve any such exterior architectural or
site features, the Commission shall forthwith issue a certificate of
nonapplicability.
C.
If the Commission determines that such application for a certificate
does involve any exterior architectural or site features subject to review
under this article, the Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
application, except as may otherwise be provided in this article, within
30 days of filing of the application. At least 14 days before said public
hearing, public notice of the time, place, and purposes thereof shall be
given by posting in a conspicuous place in Town Hall, and by mailing a
copy of said public notice, postage prepaid, to the:
(1) Applicant;
Owners of all adjoining property and other property deemed by the
Commission to be materially affected thereby as they appear on the
most recent real estate tax list of the Board of Assessors;
(2)
(3) Planning Board;
Any person filing a written request for notice of hearings, such
request to be renewed yearly in December; and
(4)
Such other persons as the Commission shall deem entitled to
notice.

§ 112-30 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS § 112-31
108:157
As soon as convenient after such public hearing, but in any event within
45 days after the filing of an application for a certificate, or within
such further time as the applicant may allow in writing, the Commission
shall make a determination on the application, and issue a certificate
or a disapproval. In the case of a disapproval of an application for
a certificate, the Commission shall set forth in its disapproval the
reasons for such determination. The Commission may include in its
disapproval specific recommendations for changes in the applicant's
proposal with respect to the appropriateness of design, arrangement,
texture, material, and similar features which if made and filed with the
Commission in a subsequent application, would make the application
acceptable to the Commission.
E.
Prior to the issuance of a disapproval of an application for a certificate
of appropriateness, the Commission may, at its sole discretion, notify
the applicant in writing of its proposed action accompanied by specific
recommendations of changes in the applicant's proposal which, if made,
would make the application acceptable to the Commission. If within
30 days of the receipt of such notice the applicant files a written
modification of the application in conformity with the recommended
changes of the Commission, the Commission shall issue a certificate of
appropriateness.
F.
Certificates shall be issued upon a concurring vote of a majority of
the members of the Commission. Each certificate of appropriateness,
nonapplicability or hardship issued by the Commission shall be dated
and signed by its Chairman, Secretary, or such other person designated
by the Commission to sign such certificates on its behalf.
G.
In issuing certificates, the Commission may, as it deems appropriate,
impose certain conditions and limitations and may require architectural
or plan modifications consistent with the intent and purpose of this
article.
H.
The Commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness based upon
the application if it determines that the construction, alteration, or
demolition for which an application has been filed will be appropriate
for or compatible with the preservation or protection of the district.
Nothing herein shall prevent the Commission from making
recommendations for changes in the applicant's proposal, which may
include changes in design, arrangement, texture, material, and similar
features, that, if made, would make the application acceptable to the
Commission, and if the applicant so assents, including such
modifications in any certificate of appropriateness it may issue.
I.
The Commission shall issue a certificate of hardship to the applicant
if the Commission determines that: (1) owing to conditions especially
affecting the building, structure, setting, or place involved, but not
affecting the district generally, failure to approve an application will
involve a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the applicant;
(2) such application may be approved without substantial derogation
J.
§ 112-31 BARNSTABLE CODE § 112-31
108:158
§ 112-32. Criteria for Commission determinations.
from the intent and purpose of this chapter; and (3) the application
may be approved without substantial detriment to the public welfare.
If the Commission determines that owing to such conditions failure to
approve an application will involve substantial hardship to the applicant
and approval thereof may be made without such substantial detriment
or derogation, the Commission shall issue a certificate of hardship.
If the Commission fails to make a determination through issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness or a disapproval within the time period
specified in Subsection E (45 days), or within such further time as the
applicant may allow in writing, the Commission shall thereupon issue a
certificate of hardship due to failure to act.
K.
The Commission shall send a copy of its certificates and determinations
of disapproval to the applicant, and shall file such copies with the
offices of the Town Clerk, and the Building Commissioner. The date
of issuance of a certificate or determination of disapproval shall be
the date of the filing of a copy of such certificate or determination of
disapproval with the office of the Town Clerk.
L.
In deliberating on applications for certificates, the Commission shall
consider, among other things, the historical and architectural value
and significance of the site, building, structure, setting, or place; the
general exterior design, scale, color, placement on the lot including
dimensions and setback, arrangement, proportions, texture, material of
the building or structure; setting, topography, landscaping, and general
appearance of the feature(s) involved and the relation of such feature(s)
to similar features of buildings and structures in the surrounding area;
and the position of such buildings or structures in relation to the streets
or ways and to other buildings or structures.
A.
In the case of new construction or additions to existing buildings or
structures the Commission shall consider the appropriateness of the
size, shape, and location of the building or structure, both in relation
to the land area upon which the building or structure is situated and to
buildings, structures, and general setting in the vicinity.
B.
In cases of demolition or removal, the Commission shall consider
whether such demolition or removal of a building, structure, setting, or
site element whose architectural or historical significance contributes
to the historic character of the district would impair the public interest
and the general welfare of the people of Barnstable; whether the
demolition or removal of the building or structure would undermine the
purpose and intent of this article, whether the building or structure has
so deteriorated that preservation or restoration is not structurally or
economically feasible, provided that the owner's self-created hardship
or failure to maintain the property in good repair shall not qualify as
a basis for the issuance of a certificate of hardship. The Commission

may seek advise from individuals or organizations in making these
determinations.
The Commission shall not make any recommendation or requirement
except for the purpose of preventing developments incongruous to
the historical aspects or the architectural and other physical
characteristics of the surroundings and of the district.
D.
Pursuant to Section 5-1 of the Town of Barnstable Home Rule Charter,
there shall be established a Historic District Appeals Committee,
hereinafter called the Committee, which shall consist of three members
independent of the Commission appointed annually by the Town
Council. The Committee shall include one member, where possible,
from the Hyannis business community, one member, where possible,
who is a resident of Hyannis, and one member, where possible, from the
field of architecture or a related profession.
A.
Any person or persons aggrieved by a determination of the Commission,
or by its failure to act as specified in this article, may, within 20
calendar days after the filing of such notice with the Town Clerk,
appeal to the Committee in writing. The Committee shall hear all
pertinent evidence and act upon such appeals within 30 calendar days
after the filing of such appeal. The decision of the Committee shall
be determined by a majority vote of the Committee members. If they
determine that the Commission action is unsupported by the evidence,
or exceeds the authority of the Commission, they may annul the
Commission decision, or remand the case for further action by the
Commission. The findings of the Committee shall be binding on the
applicant and the Commission unless a further appeal is sought in the
Superior Court.
B.
Any person or persons aggrieved by a determination of the Commission,
or by its failure to act as specified in this article, or by a finding of
the Committee, may appeal to the Superior Court sitting in equity for
Barnstable County.
C.
Costs shall not be allowed against the Commission or the Committee
unless it shall appear to the court that the such Commission or
Committee acted with gross negligence, in bad faith, or with malice in
the matter from which the appeal was taken.
D.
Costs shall not be allowed against the party appealing such decision of
the Commission or Committee unless it shall appear to the Court that
the appellant acted in bad faith or with malice in making the appeal to
the Court.

§ 112-35. Effective date.
This article shall become effective upon appointment of all members to the
Commission and Committee and adoption of design guidelines and the filing
of the map showing the boundaries of the district is filed with the Town
Clerk and is recorded in the Registry of Deeds for Barnstable County. The
foregoing shall be implemented not later than one year from adoption of
this article by the Town Council.
§ 112-36. Severability.
In case any provision, section, paragraph, or part of this article be for any
reason declared invalid or held unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, every other provision, section, paragraph or part shall continue
in full force and effect.
The Building Commissioner shall be charged with the enforcement of
this article.
A.
The Superior Court sitting in equity for Barnstable County has
jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this article and the rulings
issued thereunder. Upon petition by the Commission or the Town
Manager, said Court may restrain the applicant through injunction and
without limitation may order the removal of any building, structure
or exterior architectural feature constructed in violation thereof, or
the substantial restoration of any building, structure or exterior
architectural feature altered or demolished in violation thereof, and
may issue such other orders for relief as may be equitable. Nothing in
this chapter shall be construed to limit the Commission from pursuing
other available remedies including those provided by § 21D of Chapter
40 of the General Laws.
B.
Any person who violates any of the provisions of this article shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined
$200, which shall be forfeited to the use of the Town. Each day that a
violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense.

PROBLEM PROPERTIES, CHRONIC
GENERAL REFERENCES
Peace and good order — See Ch. 147.
§ 160-1. Purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to define a coherent method of
addressing the adverse effects on the health, safety, welfare, and quality of
life of residents arising from properties where illegal activity occurs on a
regular basis. Some persons that own or control such properties allow their
properties to be used for illegal activity, with the result that these properties
have become chronic problem properties in the neighborhood. Chronic
problem properties within the Town of Barnstable cause a financial burden
by the numerous calls for service to the properties because of the illegal
activities that repeatedly occur or exist on such properties. The current
provisions of the ordinances relating to noise and disturbing the peace do
not provide an adequate tool for abating such chronic problem properties.
The Town through its public safety, code enforcement and regulatory
agencies is in a unique position to gather data on such properties and to
establish an active plan tailored to address the particularized problems and
costs posed by specific properties.
§ 160-2. Cost of assigned police officers.
Authority for police response. Where Police Department personnel,
while on duty in service to the Department, are dispatched or caused to
respond at a particular dwelling unit, property or location on multiple
occasions, to incidents involving criminal offenses, whether a
misdemeanor or felony under federal, state or local law, the Chief of
Police is hereby authorized and empowered to assign to such dwelling
unit, property or location a member or members of the department to
staff such police response as the Chief of Police deems appropriate to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the Town of
Barnstable.
A.
Requirements for police response. Such assignment of a police
response shall only occur after the following procedure has been
satisfied:
B.
§ 150-5 BARNSTABLE CODE § 160-2
150:198
Upon being dispatched or caused to respond to an incident at a
property involving a misdemeanor or a felony, Police Department
personnel shall investigate the validity of the complaint against the
occupants at the particular property or location.
(1)
Upon finding a valid complaint, police shall make a record of the
incident and shall mail a copy of this chapter and copies of the
all-calls reports relating to said police response to the property
owner by certified mail. A "valid complaint," "incident" or "felony
or misdemeanor," as used in this chapter, shall not include a
complaint, incident or offense where an occupant of the premises
is the victim of the crime.
(2)
The Police Department shall make a record of the number of such
incidents at a particular dwelling unit, property or location and
keep such record within the Department's control.
(3)
After two valid complaint incidents in a twelve-month period
relating to the occupancy of a dwelling unit, or to a particular
property or location, the Chief of Police or his designee may
request a meeting with the property owner to coordinate a plan
to resolve the incidents at the particular property. For the purpose
of calculating the number of such incidents, where a particular
property contains more than one single dwelling unit, providing
complete independent living facilities for one or more persons,
including provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and
sanitation, a valid complaint incident shall be attributable to any
single unit where the valid complaint incident has been
documented, and not to the entire multiple-unit property.
(4)
After the four valid complaint incidents, whether misdemeanor or
felony, in a twelve-month period, relating to the property owner,
tenants or occupants of a dwelling unit or at a particular property
or location, the Chief of Police shall schedule a meeting with the
property owner and after the hearing, at his/her discretion, may
make the decision to designate the property as a chronic problem
property and assign a police response.
Factors that shall be considered by the Chief of Police include
the following:
[1] The nature, scope, and seriousness of the incident(s);
[2] Whether incident(s) resulted in an arrest;
History of criminal activity taking place at the property or
dwelling unit;
[3]
Property owners' and tenants'/occupants' willingness to
cooperate with police.
[4]
(a)
(5)
§ 160-2 PEDDLING AND HAWKING § 160-2
150:199
The Chief of Police shall notify, in writing, the property owner
of his decision to designate the property as a chronic problem
property and to assign police response as follows:
If the property owner resides within the Town of
Barnstable, such notification should be hand delivered to
the property owner's residence or usual place of business
that is on record at the Assessor's office and by mailing the
notification to such address by regular and certified mail,
return receipt requested; or
[1]
If the property owner does not reside within the Town
of Barnstable, by mailing the notification to the property
owner's residence or usual place of business that is on
record at the Assessor's office by regular and certified
mail, return receipt requested.
[2]
The Chief of Police's notification must inform the property
owner that he/she may request, in writing, a hearing,
within 14 days of the notification, from the Chief of Police
and where and to whom he/she must address his/her letter
of appeal, specified under § 160-2D.
[3]
The notification shall contain the number of valid
complaint incidents which occurred on said property in a
twelve-month period.
[4]
(b)
After the hearing under Subsection B(5) above, the property may
be officially identified as a chronic problem property, and the
property owner shall be subject to the penalties addressed in
Subsection C. The Chief of Police may commence assigning police
response seven days after hand delivery of the notification and 10
days after mailing the notification to the property owner.
(6)
The Chief of Police or his designee shall keep an accurate record
of the cost of police response to a particular property or location,
including an accurate record of the number of officers who are part
of the determined response; and the Chief of Police shall forward
such record to the Collector.
(7)
Coordination of police response is subject to the rules and
regulations of the Department.
(8)
Penalties.
The Collector is hereby authorized and empowered to notify and
bill the property owner for the costs the Town incurred for its police
response in addition to any incidental costs during the period
of police response to the dwelling unit, particular property or
location. The property owner is responsible for payment of the bill
in full within 30 days of receiving the bill, unless an appeal under
(1)
C.
§ 160-2 BARNSTABLE CODE § 160-2
150:200
§ 160-2D is timely filed. All amounts collected by the Collector shall
be deposited into the general fund of the Town.
Any unpaid bill for police response, including interest and/or
collection costs, shall be added to the real estate tax on the
property and collected as part of that tax. Failure to pay real estate
taxes will render the property owner delinquent, and the Collector
shall commence foreclosure proceedings.
(2)
Property owner's rights. The property owner may request, in writing,
a hearing before the Problem Properties Appeals Committee within 14
days of receipt of notification in order to appeal the designation of the
property as a chronic problem property under § 160-2B(6) and/or to
contest any penalties set forth in § 160-2C. A decision on the appeal
must be in writing. If the Committee finds that the property is not a
chronic problem property, the designation shall be removed and any
penalties assessed shall be rescinded. If the Committee finds that the
property is a chronic problem property, it may 1) uphold the penalty in
its entirety or 2) reduce the penalty or 3) abate any portion thereof that
has already been paid.
D.
Eviction. In the event the property owner has commenced the process
of eviction against the tenant(s) responsible for the incidents at the
property, and demonstrates that he has proceeded diligently and in
good faith, then the application of this chapter shall be stayed until the
eviction process is concluded. The Chief of Police may continue police
response at the particular property or location, at his discretion, at
all times after the eviction proceeding has been completed; provided,
however, that such costs shall not be assessed to the property owner.
E.
Charges to constitute municipal lien pursuant to MGL c. 40, § 58. All
charges to recover costs imposed in this chapter shall constitute a
municipal lien on the property so charged in accordance with MGL c.
40, § 58.
F.
Reporting requirements. The Chief of Police shall submit a written
report to the Town Manager and Town Council, no later than six months
after the effective date of this chapter, which shall include the total
cost of administration of this chapter, as well as an accounting of all
revenues collected in association with it. It shall also contain data
regarding all dwelling units within a property, particular properties
or locations which remain chronic problem properties and those that
are no longer designated as chronic problem properties. The report
shall also include the general impact, if any, that the implementation of
this chapter has had on the health, safety, and welfare of' residents of
Barnstable.

Synthetic Marijuana and Synthetic Marijuana Analogue
[Adopted 9-3-2015 by Order No. 2016-017]
§ 208-1. Purpose and intent.
It has been determined that certain businesses and/or individuals within
the Town of Barnstable are possessing and selling certain substances which
when ingested produce intoxicating effects similar to Tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) or marijuana. These substances, which are described herein, are
often used as an alternative synthetic to marijuana and are potentially
dangerous to users and society, and the long-term effects are not yet known.
The effects of these substances are a health concern to the citizens of
Barnstable. Not all of the substances are categorized as illegal controlled
substances under state or federal law. By selling these legal substances for
smoking and ingestion in the guise of incense, the manufacturers avoid the
United States Food and Drug Administration process for study and approval
of such prior to distribution for consumption. In addition, by marketing
such incense products directed at the controlled drug subculture, the
manufacturers and sellers avoid the schedule implications of the Controlled
Substances Act. The Town of Barnstable Town Council recognizes there is
no legitimate purpose for such synthetic chemicals contained therein.
§ 208-2. Prohibited activities.
§ 208-3. Exceptions.
It shall be unlawful for any person to possess, sell, barter, give, publicly
display for sale; attempt to possess, sell, barter, or give; or transport
any material, compound, mixture or preparation within the corporate
limits of the Town of Barnstable which contains any quantity of
synthetic marijuana or synthetic marijuana analogue.
A.
This article shall apply regardless of whether the synthetic marijuana or
synthetic marijuana analogue is described as tobacco, herbs, incense,
spice, bath salts, plant food or any blend thereof, and, regardless of
whether the substance is marketed for the purpose of being smoked or
ingested, and, regardless of whether the substance is marked "not for
human consumption."
B.
It is not an offense under this article if the person was acting at
the direction of the Barnstable Police Department and its officers, or
federal or state law enforcement, to enforce or ensure compliance with
this article prohibiting the sale of the aforementioned substances.
A.
If the Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacts criminal penalties for
the possession, sale, transportation, or delivery of any chemical
substance listed in this article, then upon the effective date of such
enactment, this article shall no longer be deemed effective for that
substance. However, a violation of this article occurring prior to the

ARTICLE I
Preamble; Purpose; Definitions
§ 221-1. Preamble.
§ 221-2. Purpose.
It is the expressed policy of the Town of Barnstable to enhance the
appearance of the Town by beautifying roadways and public property with
shade trees and, in so doing, improve property values and the economy. The
Town has invested substantial resources to plant and maintain trees, and
these trees belong to the citizens of the Town. The Town also recognizes the
need for a highly reliable network of public utilities to supply businesses,
homes, hospitals, and other services, in an area subject to frequent storms
and high winds.
§ 221-3. Definitions.
Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the meaning of terms
used in this chapter shall be as follows:
In order to maintain and enhance the architectural character,
streetscapes and scenic views along the Town's roadways of which
trees are an integral part, the Town hereby reiterates its established
policy with regard to wires and cables along roadways: Since 1926
the Town has established policies for the placement of utility wires
and cables underground. Underground utilities were first articulated in
"The Preliminary Survey for a Town Plan for the Town of Barnstable,"
dated October 1926, and more recently in the "Local Comprehensive
Plan" adopted by the Town Council October 1997 and approved by the
Cape Cod Commission 1998. Policy 7.3.3 states that all new utilities
shall be placed underground, and that all existing overhead utilities
shall be phased underground.
A.
All utilities should submit a program to the Town for phasing of utilities
underground in order to prevent continued damage to the Town's trees
by trimming, pruning and removals, and to prevent the constant
occurrence of power outages.
B.
Until such time as utilities are placed underground, bare wires should
be replaced with aerial spacer cable systems or covered wires, in order
to limit the amount of tree trimming and clearance, and maintain the
viability of the Town's trees. Such systems will also provide the highest
reliability of electrical service of any aboveground system available.
C.
The utilities should submit a program to the Town for replacement of
bare wires with covered conductors, and/or aerial spacer systems. The
utilities and the Town should establish priorities for this program. In
priority order, the Old Kings Highway (Rt. 6A), scenic roads, the Town
center and village commercial centers are the Town's first priorities for
such installation.
D.
§ 221-1 TREES § 221-3
221:277
TOWN TREES — Trees, shrubs and bushes within the Town's jurisdiction.
TREE TOPPING — The severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than
three inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to
remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree.
VISION CLEARANCE — That area included within the street lines at points
which are 20 feet distant from their point of intersection measured along
said street lines which will materially obstruct the view of a driver of a
vehicle approaching a street intersection.

Tree Removal and Replanting
§ 221-18. Tree removal permits required.
A valid work permit shall be obtained from the Tree Warden for removal
of any Town tree, except that approval of the Conservation Commission

Ch. 40, § 15C, and Chapter 180, Scenic Roads, of the Code of the Town of
Barnstable, and the Old Kings Highway along Route 6A pursuant to MGL
Ch 61. In addition, tree removal may be subject to the Old Kings Highway
Regional District pursuant to MGL Ch. 470 of the Acts of 1973, as amended,
or any local Historic District, pursuant to MGL Ch. 40C, as amended. The
forgoing list is intended to be for convenience only and does not purport to
be exhaustive; this section shall not be construed as an exemption from or
a relaxation of any applicable requirements of law.
§ 221-19. Replacement of Town trees.
Town trees to be removed shall be replaced, subject to approval of a

in dispute, the following methods for assessing replacement shall apply:
The value of a public tree being removed shall be assessed by
the Tree Warden based upon standards in the industry, and the
costs assessed to the applicant. Such costs shall be placed in
an account dedicated to the replacement planting of trees along
the Town's roadways. In evaluating tree value, the applicant for
tree removal may submit information based upon the Council of
Tree and Landscape Appraisers, trunk formula method, or other
nationally recognized methodology. Alternatively, the approving
entities listed in § 221-18 above may require the replanting of
street trees of equivalent value to the tree being removed.
(1)
Where a Town tree is being removed for safety reasons and the
value of the tree being removed has been reduced by previous
damage or trimming, the tree shall be replaced with a minimum
of two street trees, or the value thereof placed into an account
dedicated to tree replacement.
(2)
Any planned program of tree removal shall be subject to a tree
replacement program, specifying the numbers, location, type and
size of trees to be installed, and a maintenance program. Where

groundwater. The Town's entire drinking water supply is derived from
groundwater, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has
designated all of Cape Cod as a "sole source aquifer" requiring special
care and protection. The groundwater system is internally connected with
surface waters, lakes, streams and coastal estuaries, which constitute
important recreational and economic resources of the Town. Contamination
of the aquifer and related surface water resources pose a serious threat to
the health, safety and financial well-being of the Town.
§ 232-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare by maintaining quality groundwater through the regulation of the
volume of certain wastewater discharges.

sewage disposal system" shall not include the maintenance, repair and
alteration of an existing individual on-site sewage disposal system. However
in no case shall the discharge of wastewater increase beyond that present
prior to such maintenance, repair and alteration.
§ 232-9. Determining compliance of new systems with standards.
Any new system not in violation of the standards contained within §§ 232-5
through 232-8 shall be deemed to be in compliance with §§ 232-5 through
232-8.
§ 232-10. Administration; certificate of compliance.
This chapter shall be administered by the Board of Health or its designee
by verifying compliance with the provisions established herein. Within 10
Zones of contribution to public supply wells are shown on a map
entitled "Revised Groundwater Protection Map," Planning Division,
dated February 2002, which is on file in the office of the Town Clerk.

surface water, tidal action or coastal storm flowage. In the event that
the Commission determines that an activity occurring beyond the limit
of jurisdiction noted above is having or has had a significant effect on
the wetlands values of a resource area, the Commission may require a
notice of intent or determination of applicability for that activity.
A.
In determining whether a resource area is subject to the provisions of
this chapter, the origin of the wetland, whether natural or man made, is
not a relevant factor.
B.
The permit and application required by this chapter shall not be
required for maintaining, repairing, or replacing (but not substantially
changing or enlarging), any existing and lawfully located structure or
facility used in the service of the public to provide electric, gas, water,
telephone, telegraph or other telecommunications services, sewage
collection and traffic control, provided written notice has been given
to the Commission prior to the commencement of work, and provided
that the work conforms to performance standards, design specification,
policy guidelines and other regulations adopted by the Commission.
A.
The permit and application required by this chapter shall not be
required for normal maintenance or improvement of land or waters
in an existing agricultural or aquacultural use. Expansion of existing
uses in these areas or new uses in areas within the jurisdiction of this
chapter will require a permit.
B.
The permit and application required by this chapter shall not apply to
emergency projects necessary for the protection of wetlands values or
the health and safety of the public, provided that the work is to be
performed by or has been ordered to be performed by an agency of the
commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof. For this work, advance
notice, oral or written, must be given to the Commission prior to or
within 24 hours after the commencement of work. The Commission
or its agent must certify the work to be an emergency project prior
to the commencement of work. The work must be performed only
for the time and place certified by the Commission for the limited
purposes necessary to abate the emergency, but in no instance shall the
emergency period exceed 30 days. All emergency work must conform
to the performance standards, design specifications, policy guidelines

and other regulations adopted by the Commission. Within 21 days of the
commencement of an emergency project, a permit application shall be
filed with the Commission for review as provided in this chapter. Upon
failure to meet these and other requirements of the Commission, the
Commission may, after notice and a public hearing, revoke or modify
an emergency project approval and order restoration and mitigation
measures.
Written applications shall be filed with the Commission to perform
activities regulated by this chapter affecting resource areas protected
by this chapter. The application shall include such information and
plans as are deemed necessary by the Commission to describe proposed
activities and their effects on wetlands, resource areas, and their
values. No activities shall commence without receiving a permit issued
pursuant to this chapter (except as provided in § 237-3).
A.
The Commission may, at its discretion, accept as the application and
plans under this chapter the notice of intent and plans filed under the
Wetlands Protection Act.
B.
Any person desiring to know whether or not a proposed activity of an
area is subject to this chapter may, in writing, request a determination
from the Commission. Such a request for determination shall contain
data and plans specified by the regulations of the Commission.
C.
At the time of an application or request the applicant shall pay a
filing fee specified in the regulations of the Commission. This fee is
in addition to that required by the Wetlands Protection Act. The
Commission may waive the filing fee and costs and expenses for an
application or request filed by a government agency, or if the applicant
can prove financial hardship, or other extenuating circumstances.
D.
Any person filing an application or a request for determination with
the Commission shall give written notice thereof, within 14 days of the
public hearing, by certified mail or hand delivery, to all abutters in
accordance with the regulations of the Commission.
A.
The Commission shall conduct a public hearing on any application
or request for determination. At the expense of the applicant, the
Commission shall cause written notice of the hearing to be published at
least five working days prior to the public hearing in a paper of general
circulation in the Town of Barnstable.
B.
The Commission shall commence the public hearing within 21 days
from the receipt of a completed notice of intent or request for
determination. The Commission or its agents shall determine, for
scheduling purposes only and in accordance with the submission

regulations of the Commission, that the application or request is
complete. The twenty-one-day deadline for a hearing may be extended
by the Commission or its agents only with the assent of the applicant.
The Commission shall issue its decision on the notice of intent in
writing within 21 days of the close of the public hearing thereon. The
Commission shall issue its decision on the request for determination in
writing within 21 days of receipt of the request.
D.
The Commission in an appropriate case may combine its hearing under
this chapter with the hearing conducted under the Wetlands Protection
Act.
E.
The Commission may accept the applicant's request to continue the
public hearing to a date and time certain announced at the hearing,
for reasons stated at the hearing, which may include the receipt of
additional information offered by the applicant deemed necessary by
the Commission.
F.
If the Commission, after a public hearing, determines that the proposed
activities which are the subject of a notice of intent are not likely
to have a significant or cumulative effect upon the wetlands values
protected by this chapter, the Commission, within 21 days of the close
of the public hearing, shall issue a permit for the activities requested.
If it issues a permit, the Commission shall impose conditions which the
Commission deems necessary or desirable to protect those wetlands
values, and all activities shall be done in accordance with those
conditions.
A.
The Commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet
the requirements of this chapter; for failure to submit necessary
information and plans required or requested by the Commission; for
failure to meet the design specifications, performance standards, policy
guidelines or other requirements in regulations of the Commission;
for failure to avoid or prevent unacceptable significant or cumulative
effects upon the wetlands values protected by this chapter; where it
is deemed that the denial is necessary to preserve the environmental
quality of resource areas; and where no conditions are adequate to
protect those values. Due consideration shall be given to any
demonstrated hardship on the applicant by reason of denial, as
presented at the public hearing.
B.
In order to protect the values inherent in wetland areas, it is the intent
of this chapter to preserve wetlands, surface water bodies and other
resource areas as functioning natural ecosystems. Filling of wetlands
is therefor prohibited except when mitigated by wetlands replication
as permitted in this section. At its discretion, the Conservation
A.
§ 237-5 BARNSTABLE CODE § 237-7
232:304
§ 237-8. Promulgation of standards, specifications and rules.
Commission may permit activities involving wetlands replication that
do not harm the wetlands values protected under this chapter.
Wetlands replication in order to make lands buildable, as by fulfilling
septic system setbacks, flood elevation requirements or other
construction setbacks, or to achieve lot area requirements, is
prohibited. Replication is prohibited in areas providing habitat for
existing rare or endangered species as listed by the Massachusetts
Natural Heritage Program.
B.
Replication may be permitted to provide access to otherwise buildable
uplands. Replication may also be permitted when an overriding public
purpose can be demonstrated. The creation of new wetlands may be
permitted, without any concomitant wetlands filling, when the
applicant can demonstrate that such creation will not harm existing
wetlands or their values. Purposes for creating new wetlands include,
but are not limited to, the absorption of stormwater runoff,
improvement of wildlife habitat, stabilization of unvegetated intertidal
areas, or aesthetic, experimental, or scientific purposes.
C.
No more than 2,500 square feet of wetland may be filled in accordance
with this section. The replicated wetland must be at least equal in size
to the wetland that is filled and properly vegetated. Where physically
possible, replicated wetlands shall be made contiguous with existing
natural wetlands. When a person owns abutting properties, any
applications on the properties for wetlands replication submitted within
the same calendar year shall be treated as one proposal for the purpose
of evaluating wetlands replication, and the combined area to be filled
shall not exceed 2,500 square feet.
D.
Due to the fact that replication is an experimental process and is
subject to failure, the Commission may require any applicant
requesting permission for wetlands replication to conduct a scientific
monitoring program to last for a time period as determined by the
Commission, but not to exceed five years. If said monitoring period is
less than five years, the Commission shall review the results at the end
of the monitoring period to determine if additional monitoring is needed
within the maximum five-year period. The applicant shall provide an
escrow bond for the duration of the monitoring period plus one year
to cover correction of any deficiencies revealed by the monitoring
program. Said bond shall, at a minimum, be equal to the initial cost of
the replication.
E.
After public notice and public hearing the Commission may, from time
to time, promulgate performance standards, design specifications,
policy guidelines and other rules and regulations to accomplish the
purposes of this chapter. Failure of the Commission to promulgate such
rules and regulations or a legal declaration of their invalidity by a court
of law shall not act to suspend or invalidate the effect of this chapter.
A.
§ 237-7 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE § 237-8
232:305
§ 237-9. Escrow and security.
§ 237-10. Enforcement.
Any performance standards, design specifications, policy guidelines
or other rules and regulations promulgated under a lawfully adopted
Wetlands Protection Ordinance of the Town of Barnstable which may be
superseded by this chapter shall be considered a part of this chapter at
the time of its adoption.
B.
The Commission may require the establishment of an escrow account
or other security running to the municipality, and sufficient as to form
and surety in the opinion of the Commission's counsel, to secure faithful
and satisfactory performance of work required by any permit, in such
sum and upon such conditions as the Commission may require.
A.
Notwithstanding the above, the amount of such escrow account of
security shall not exceed the estimated cost of the work required or
the restoration of affected lands and properties if the work is not
performed as required, whichever is greater. Forfeiture of any such
escrow account or security shall be recoverable at the suit of the
municipality in Superior Court. The Commission may, at its discretion,
accept as security a conservation restriction, easement or other
covenant enforceable in a court of law, executed and duly recorded by
the owner of record, running with the land to the benefit of the Town
of Barnstable whereby the permit conditions shall be performed and
observed before any lot may be conveyed other than by mortgage deed.
B.
The Commission, its agents, officers, and employees shall have the
authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of
performing their duties under this chapter. With the authority of the
property owner or his designee, the Commission may make or cause
to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the Commission
deems necessary.
A.
The Commission shall have the authority to enforce this chapter, its
regulations, and permits issued thereunder by violation notices,
administrative orders, and civil and criminal court actions.
B.
Upon request of the Commission, the Town Manager and Town Attorney
may take legal action for enforcement under civil law. Upon request
of the Commission, the Chief of Police may take legal action for
enforcement under criminal law.
C.
Upon request of the Commission, municipal boards and officers,
including any police officer, natural resource officer, or other officer
having police powers, shall have the authority to assist the Commission
in enforcement.
D.
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter, regulations
thereunder, or permits issued thereunder, shall be punished by a fine
E.
§ 237-8 BARNSTABLE CODE § 237-10
232:306
§ 237-11. Burden of proof.
The applicant shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of
credible evidence that the work proposed in the application will not have
an unacceptable significant and cumulative effect upon the wetland values
protected by this chapter. Failure to provide adequate evidence to the
Commission supporting this burden shall be sufficient cause for the
Commission to deny a permit or grant a permit with conditions.
§ 237-12. Relation to the Wetlands Protection Act.
This chapter is adopted under the Home Rule Amendment of the
Massachusetts Constitution and the home rule statutes, independent of the
Wetlands Protection Act (MGL c. 131, § 40), and regulations thereunder,
except where specifically included herein.
§ 237-13. Definitions.
The following definitions apply to the interpretation of this chapter. Unless
otherwise defined here, definitions found in 310 CMR also apply to this
chapter.
AESTHETICS — Retention or improvement of natural conditions, including
natural lighting, sound, odors and significant trees, as at the time are
experienced by the general public from public ways, including waterways.
Activities in or within 100 feet of any resource area shall not have
significant effects on aesthetic values.
AGRICULTURE — Any work which produces food or other products for
commerce or subsistence which occurs in, on, or within 100 feet of a
resource area or which is directly or indirectly dependent upon wetlands
values for proper agricultural functions, such as prevention of pollution or
maintenance of adequate water flow for irrigation. Agriculture includes, but
is not limited to the growing of crops, including cranberries, and the raising
of livestock. Nonagricultural activities in or within 100 feet of resource
areas shall not have a significant effect on existing agriculture.
Notwithstanding this definition, new or expanded agricultural activities
shall not have a significant effect on other wetlands values identified in
§ 237-1 of this chapter.
ALTER — To change the condition of areas within jurisdiction of the
Conservation Commission. Activities presumed to alter these areas, include,
but are not limited to, the following:
of not more than $300. Each day or portion thereof during which
a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense, and each
provision of the chapter, regulations or permit violated shall constitute
a separate offense.
In the alternative to criminal prosecution, the Commission may elect
to utilize the noncriminal disposition procedure set forth in MGL c. 40,
§ 21D.
F.
§ 237-10 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE § 237-13
232:307
AQUACULTURE — The growing, raising, breeding, storing, or producing of
specified aquatic or marine organisms at specified locations for commercial,
municipal, or scientific purposes as approved by appropriate agencies.
Organisms in aquacultural use include, but are not limited to: shellfish, such
as oysters, quahogs, clams, lobsters, mussels, scallops and crabs; finfish,
such as trout, eel, herring, salmon, smelt and bass; amphibians, such as
frogs; reptiles, such as turtles; seaweeds, such as Irish moss and dulse;
edible freshwater plants, such as watercress; and plankton grown as a food
source for other organisms. Activities in or within 100 feet of a resource
area shall not have a significant effect on existing permitted aquaculture.
Notwithstanding this definition, new or expanded aquacultural activities
shall not have a significant effect on other wetlands values set forth in
§ 237-1 of this chapter.
COASTAL BANK — The first significant break in slope beyond the onehundred-
year storm elevation on a seaward face or elevated landform, other
than a coastal dune, which lies at the landward edge of a coastal beach,
land subject to tidal action, or other coastal wetland. The slope of the bank
must be greater than an 18% and serve to contain storm flowage, rather
than being inundated by it, or function as a sediment source. A coastal bank
may serve one of two functions:
Removal, excavation or dredging if soil, sand, gravel or aggregate
materials of any kind;
A.
Changing of preexisting drainage characteristics, flushing
characteristics, salinity distribution, sedimentation patterns, flow
patterns, or flood retention characteristics;
B.
C. Drainage or other disturbance of water level or water table;
D. Dumping, discharging, or filling with any material;
E. Placing of fill or brush or removal of material;
Erection of buildings, or structures of any kind; installation of piles
except in accordance with pier maintenance regulations of the
Commission;
F.
Destruction of plant life including the cutting of trees; application
of pesticides or herbicides except in accordance with agricultural
exemptions set forth in § 237-3;

physical or chemical characteristics of water;
H.
Any activities, changes or work which pollute in any way any body of
water or groundwater;
I.
Any activities that change the aesthetics of a resource area in a
significant manner and for more than a temporary period.
J.
It may serve as a vertical buffer because of its height and stability
which protects upland areas from storm damage and flooding. Activities
A.
§ 237-13 BARNSTABLE CODE § 237-13
232:308
CUMULATIVE EFFECTS — Activities regulated under this chapter which
may be individually minor, but when considered in relation to other past,
present or future activities in a given area may be significant in the
aggregate.
EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL —
FLOOD CONTROL — The ability of wetlands to absorb, store and slowly
release floodwaters to minimize peak flood levels. Flooding can be caused
by precipitation or a rising water table. Activities within 100 feet of
resource areas shall not alter the flood control value of wetlands
significantly.
GROUNDWATER — All subsurface water contained in natural geologic
formations or artificial fill, including soil water in the zone of aeration.
Activities in or within 100 feet of resource areas shall not significantly alter
the existing quality or elevation of naturally occurring groundwater.
HISTORICAL VALUES — The importance of wetlands and adjoining land
areas as sites often used for prehistoric and historic occupation,
subsistence, industry, trade, agriculture, burial and other cultural purposes.
Resource areas which are known to contain sites of historic or
archaeological resources (as by being listed of the State Register of Historic
shall not increase erosion of a coastal blank, either from above (by
stormwater runoff, brushcutting or other means) or from below (by tidal
action, wind and waves). Any project on such a coastal bank shall have
no adverse impact on the stability of the coastal bank.
Coastal banks composed of unconsolidated sediment and exposed to
vigorous wave action serve as a source of sediment for dunes, beaches,
barrier beaches and other coastal landforms. Naturally occurring wave
action removes sediment from these banks to replenish coastal
landforms. These landforms protect coastal wetlands and real property
by reducing storm damage and flooding by dissipating storm wave
energy. Any project on or within a coastal bank serving this function
shall not have a significant effect on that bank's ability to serve as a
sediment source.
B.
EROSION CONTROL — The ability of the wetland to buffer forces
or processes which would threaten or cause to be threatened the
stability of landforms and the soil and/or vegetation associated with
wetlands and adjoining land areas, in particular, coastal and inland
banks. Erosion can be caused by a wearing away of the surface soil
or by undermining the interior portion of the landform. Activities in or
within 100 feet of resource areas shall not have a significant effect on
natural erosion processes.
A.
SEDIMENTATION CONTROL — The ability of wetlands to settle out
sediments and other waterborne material by reducing water flow by
passing it through vegetation or by diffusing flow and reducing velocity.
Activities in or within 100 feet of resource areas shall not accelerate or
impede the rate of natural sedimentation significantly.
B.
§ 237-13 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE § 237-13
232:309
Places, the Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the
Commonwealth, and/or the Barnstable Historical Commission's Historic
Properties Inventory) are deemed to have historic value. Activities in or
within 100 feet of resource areas shall not have a significant effect on
historical values.
PERSON — Any individual, group of individuals, associations, partnership,
corporation, company, business organization, trust, estate, the
commonwealth or political subdivision thereof to the extent subject to
Town ordinances, administrative agency, public or quasi-public corporation
or body, the Town of Barnstable, and any other legal entity, its legal
representatives, agents, or assigns.
PRIVATE WATER SUPPLY — Any source or volume of surface or ground
water demonstrated to be in private use or shown to have potential for
private use, including ground or surface water in the zone of contribution
around a private well. Activities in or within 100 feet of a resource area shall
not have a significant effect on the quality of a private water supply.30
PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY — Any source or volume of surface or ground
water demonstrated to be in public use or approved for water supply
pursuant to MGL c. 111, § 160 by the Department of Environmental Quality
Engineering Division of Water Supply, or demonstrated to have a potential
for public use, in addition to all surface and ground water in zones of
contribution. Activities within 100 feet of resource areas shall not have a
significant effect on the quality of a public water supply.
RECREATION — Any leisure activity or sport taking place in, on, or within
100 feet of a resource area which is dependent on the resource area and
its values directly or indirectly for its conduct and enjoyment. Recreational
activities include, but are not limited to, the following: noncommercial
fishing and shellfishing, hunting, boating, swimming, walking, painting,
birdwatching and aesthetic enjoyment. Structures and activities in or within
100 feet of a resource area shall not have a significant effect on public
recreational values. Notwithstanding this definition, new or expanded
recreational activities shall not have a significant effect on other wetlands
values identified in § 237-1 of this chapter.
STORM DAMAGE PREVENTION — The ability of wetland soils, vegetation
and physiography to prevent damage caused by water from storms,
including but not limited to: erosion and sedimentation; damage to
vegetation, property or buildings; or damage caused by flooding,
waterborne debris or waterborne ice. Activities in or within 100 feet of
a resource area shall not have a significant effect on storm damage
protection.
SURFACE WATER BODY — Any area where water or ice stands or flows
over the surface of the ground for at least five months of any calendar
year except in times of severe, extended drought as defined in appropriate
section of 310 CMR. Drainage ditches, exclusive of fish runs and
30.Editor's Note: The former definition of "public trust rights," which immediately followed
this definition, was repealed 2-3-2011 by Order No. 2011-045.
§ 237-13 BARNSTABLE CODE § 237-13
232:310
intermittent streams, and impoundment areas which hold or pass water
only during or for short periods following storms and which, owing to
their relationship to groundwater, do not support wetland vegetation, are
excluded from this definition.
TRUSTLANDS — Lands impressed with public trust rights protected by the
commonwealth, including great ponds; and tidelands, being present and
former submerged lands and tidal flats lying between the natural highwater
mark and the state limit of seaward jurisdiction. Tidelands including
both flowed and filled tidelands, and privately owned and publicly owned
tidelands.
UNVEGETATED WETLAND RESOURCE AREAS — Coastal areas, such as
flats and unvegetated intertidal areas; coastal and freshwater beaches,
dunes and banks; and land subject to flooding. Also, inland areas subject to
flooding which do not support wetland vegetation, but which store at least
1/4 acre feet of water to an average depth of six inches at least once a
year, and land areas two feet or less vertically above the high-water mark
of any lake or pond defined by 310 CMR. Does not include swimming pools,
artificially lined ponds or pools, wastewater lagoons or stormwater runoff
basins, the construction of which may be regulated, but do not themselves
constitute regulated areas.
VEGETATED WETLANDS — Any area of at least 500 square feet where
surface or ground water, or ice, at or near the surface of the ground support
a plant community dominated (at least 50%) by wetland species.
WETLANDS REPLICATION — The creation of wetland, surface water body
or other resource area to compensate for the filling or other loss or
displacement of all or part of an existing wetland, surface water body or
other resource area.
WILDLIFE HABITAT — Resource areas that provide breeding and nesting
habitats, shelter, food and water to all plant and animal species dependent
on wetlands for any portion of their life cycles. Includes resource areas
identified as containing rare, threatened or endangered species as listed by
the Massachusetts Natural Heritage Program. Structures and activities in
or within 100 feet of any resource area shall not have a significant effect on
wildlife habitat.
ZONE OF CONTRIBUTION — The segment of an aquifer that contributes
significant quantities of ground or surface water to a water supply well.

maintained.

affidavit with the Building Commissioner on an annual
basis in the month of January stating that the property is
the principal residence of the owner and that the owner
is resident all times that the bed-and-breakfast is being
operated. If the affidavit is not filed, the operation shall
cease forthwith and any special permit issued shall be
considered null and void. The requirement for filing of an
affidavit shall not apply to bed-and-breakfast operations

provision shall only apply to bed-and-breakfast conditional
use operations established in residential districts.

as defined under § 9.2 of the Code, and priced to conform with the
standards of the Massachusetts Department of Housing and
Community Development (DHCD) for ownership units set forth in the
Local Initiative Program Guidelines, in order that such affordable units
shall be included in the DHCD Subsidized Housing Inventory.
APPLICANT — The person or persons, including a corporation or other
legal entity, who applies for issuance of a special permit for
construction of a private-initiated affordable housing development
(MAHD) hereunder. The applicant must own or be the beneficial owner
of all the land included in the proposed MAHD, or have authority from
the owner(s) to act for the owner(s) or hold an option or contract duly
executed by the owner(s) and the applicant giving the latter the right
to acquire the land to be included in the site.
MULTIFAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT (MAHD) — A
development of multifamily residential dwelling(s), including required
affordable units and permissible accessory structures, authorized by
special permit from the Planning Board as set forth herein.39
USE RESTRICTION — A restriction ensuring the continued affordability
of a dwelling unit. A use restriction is a deed restriction or other legally
binding instrument in a form consistent with Department of Housing
and Community Development (DHCD) Local Initiative Program (LIP)
guidelines which runs with the land and is recorded with the relevant
registry of deeds or land court registry district, and which effectively
restricts the occupancy of a low- or moderate-income housing unit
to income eligible households during the term of affordability. A use
restriction shall contain terms and conditions for the resale of a
homeownership unit, including definition of the maximum permissible
resale price, and for the subsequent rental of a rental unit, including
definition of the maximum permissible rent. A use restriction shall
require that tenants of rental units and owners of homeownership units
shall occupy the units as their principal residences.
Purpose. This section has been established to permit a variation in
development styles with efficient provision of roads and utilities; and
to provide for the public interest by the preservation of open space in
perpetuity, for protection of both natural resources and visual character
of the land.
A.
Application. An open space residential development is permitted in all
residential districts by special permit from the Planning Board.
B.
39.Editor’s Note: The definition of “nursing or convalescent home,” which immediately
followed, was repealed 11-2-2017 by Order No. 2018-027.

232:336
Minimum area. A minimum area shall be required sufficient to
accommodate no less than four dwelling units based on all the
requirements of the zoning district in which the development is located.
C.
Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted in an open space
residential development:
Detached single-family dwellings and permitted accessory uses,
including a cluster unit wastewater treatment facility.
(1)
(2) Common open space, preserved as such in perpetuity.
Recreational facilities and activities exclusively for use by residents
of an open space residential development, as approved by the
Planning Board.
(3)
D.
Density requirements. The total number of residential units allowable
within an open space residential development shall not exceed the
number of units that would be allowed in the zoning district in which
the site is located. The total number of units allowed shall be
determined by submission of a preliminary grid sketch plan in
accordance with Subsection M(1) herein, showing the total number of
developable lots which could be obtained by utilizing a conventional
grid subdivision, in conformance with all the zoning district area
requirements, and with legal access over the road providing frontage.
Lots on the preliminary plan which are not practically buildable
because of impediments to development, such as slope in excess of
15%, utility easements, impervious soils, high groundwater or the
location of wetlands, shall not be countable towards the number of
developable lots, except that this provision may be waived for a
development which is 100% affordable. For the purposes of this section,
"affordable" shall mean dwellings sold or leased by a nonprofit
corporation and/or government agency whose principal purpose is to
provide housing to eligible tenants and/or buyers. Such housing shall
remain affordable in perpetuity.
E.
Bulk regulations. The Planning Board may grant a reduction of the
bulk regulations, provided that in no instance shall any lot contain less
15,000 square feet or have less than 20 feet of frontage, a front yard
setback of not less than 20 feet, and side and rear setbacks of not less
than 12 feet. The minimum lot size may be further decreased by the
Planning Board for a development which is 100% affordable, as defined
in Subsection C above. No lot shall be panhandled more than two lots
from a roadway, and panhandled lots shall only be permitted where the
Planning Board finds that safe and adequate access is provided to the
rear lot. As a condition of approval of the special permit, the developer
shall submit evidence to the Planning Board of recorded easements,
to assure access to joint driveways, where shown on the definitive
subdivision plan.
F.
Soils. The nature of the soils and subsoils shall be suitable for the
construction of roads and buildings. The Planning Board may require
G.
§ 240-17 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE § 240-17
232:337
that soil borings or test pits be made on each lot as shown on the
preliminary sketch plan, when borings required pursuant to the
Subdivision Rules and Regulations,40 or the USDA, Soil Conservation
Service maps indicate soils which may not be suitable for development.
Soil borings if required, shall indicate soil texture, percolation rates and
depth to the ground water table at its maximum elevation, in order to
determine the buildability of each lot. Maximum groundwater elevation
shall be determined using data available from the US Geological Survey
publication "Probable High Ground Water Levels on Cape Cod."
Wastewater.
The development shall be connected to Town sewer, or shall comply
with the provisions of 310 CMR 15.00, of the State Environmental
Code (Title 5) and the on-site wastewater disposal regulations of
the Board of Health.41 No on-site sewage disposal leaching field
systems shall be located within 150 feet from any wetland or
surface water body, and where possible, located outside a
riverfront area as defined according to 310 CMR 10.58, Riverfront
Area. In no instance shall an open space residential development
be approved which requires a variance to be granted from Title
5 of the State Environmental Code, or on-site sewage disposal
regulations of the Board of Health with regard to depth to
groundwater, distance to wetlands, buildings or public or private
water supply wells. Such Board of Health variance shall render the
special permit void as it pertains to the lot or lots affected.
(1)
Based only upon recommendation by the Board of Health pursuant
to MGL Ch. 41, § 81U, that lots in the development be connected
to a clustered unit wastewater system, with or without nutrient
removal, the Planning Board shall incorporate such requirement
into a decision of approval, as a condition of that approval.
(2)
The clustered unit wastewater system shall be located as far as
possible from any sensitive environmental receptor, such as public
or private wells, wetlands or water bodies, vernal pools, and rare
and endangered species habitats.
(3)
A clustered unit wastewater system location, design, maintenance,
repair and operation is specifically subject to approval by the Board
of Health as a condition of approval of the open space residential
development.
(4)
Where the common open space is to be owned by the homeowners,
a clustered unit wastewater system shall be located on a common
open space lot, shown on the definitive plan and labeled as such.
Where the common open space is to be deeded to the Town or to
a nonprofit corporation pursuant to Subsection M(2)(b) below, a

§ 240-17 BARNSTABLE CODE § 240-17
232:338
clustered unit wastewater system shall be located upon a separate
lot and owned by a corporation or trust, owned or to be owned,
by the owners of lots or residential units within the development.
Undivided interest in the wastewater treatment facility and the
lot on which it is located shall pass with the conveyance of each
building lot, or unit. The trust or corporation documents ensuring
common ownership and management of the facility by the
homeowners shall be submitted to the Planning Board with the
definitive subdivision plan; and submitted to the Board of Health at
the time of application of the definitive plan to the Planning Board.
The homeowners corporation or trust shall be responsible for the
operation, maintenance, repair and eventual replacement of the
wastewater treatment facility, in accordance with all federal, state,
Cape Cod Commission and Board of Health requirements, as a
condition of approval of the open space residential development
special permit.
(6)
Water supply.
Public water supply shall ordinarily be required in open space
residential developments, unless the applicant demonstrates that it
cannot reasonably be made available to the site.
(1)
In areas dependent upon private wells, a special permit for an
open space residential development shall only be granted upon
recommendation from the Board of Health, pursuant to MGL Ch.
41, § 81U, with the finding that contamination of private wells both
on site and off site, will not occur, either because the development
has been designed with sufficient distance between private wells,
septic systems and drainage facilities, or because the applicant
is providing an appropriately located clustered unit wastewater
system.
(2)
No variance shall be granted from Board of Health, well and onsite
sewage disposal regulations, to waive the minimum separation
distance between a public or private well and septic system, either
on site or off site.
(3)
I.
Floodplains.
No developable lots or roads shall be located on barrier beaches
and coastal dunes as defined by the Wetlands Policy Act, or within
the FEMA V Zones.
(1)
Filling, dredging and placement of utilities or structures within
the one-hundred-year floodplain, as shown on the current National
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, shall be avoided and development
concentrated outside the A and B Flood Zones to the maximum
extent feasible. If site conditions are such that compliance with this
subsection would be impracticable, such activities may be allowed
in conformity with § 240-34 herein.
(2)
J.
§ 240-17 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE § 240-17
232:339
Preservation of site topographic features. The subdivision design shall
preserve and enhance the natural topography of the land by locating
roads and building sites in relationship to the existing topography so as
to minimize the amount of land clearance, grading, and cuts and fills.
K.
Open space use, design and maintenance standards. Within an open
space residential development, the balance of the area requirement for
lot size shall be provided in common open space, designated as an open
space lot or lots on the subdivision plan. The common open space shall
be used, designed, and maintained in accordance with the following
standards:
As a condition of approval of the special permit, open space shall
be retained as such, in perpetuity, and not built upon or developed,
except as permitted by the Planning Board pursuant to Subsection
L(5) below.
(1)
A minimum of 50% of the total upland area of the development
shall be devoted to common open space, except that 60% shall be
required where the minimum lot size of the zoning district exceeds
one acre. Land set aside for roads, appurtenant drainage systems,
and/or parking uses shall not be included in the percentage
calculation of open space. The lot, or portion of an open space lot
containing a clustered unit wastewater system, may be included in
the open space minimum percentage requirement.
(2)
Open space land shall be designed as a large contiguous lot or lots.
Strips or narrow parcels of common open space shall be permitted
only when necessary for access or for walking trails, including
linkages to adjacent trails. Open space shall be located so as to
provide maximum protection to the environmental resources of the
site and of adjacent lands. Priority natural resources areas are as
follows and shall include but not be limited to the following areas:

(g)
Open space may also be used to provide a buffer from roadways, to
protect steep slopes from development activities, and to preserve a
scenic corridor along roadways. The Planning Board in approving
an open space residential development shall take into
consideration any report from the Planning Department,
Conservation Department or Conservation Commission relative to
the location and design of the open space lot or lots.
(4)
Common open space shall be maintained in an open and natural
condition, without clearing, predominantly in its present condition,
for the protection of natural habitats, except as permitted by the
Planning Board as follows:
Where the open space is to be owned by corporation or trust
of homeowners, a maximum of 10% of the common open space
may be developed for common recreational facilities. The
location and type of recreational facilities shall be shown on
the definitive open space subdivision plan. A minimum setback
of 50 feet shall be provided between any common open space
structure and adjacent lots.
(a)
Naturally existing woods, fields, meadows and wetlands should
be maintained and improved in accordance with good
conservation practices. The Planning Board shall require
submission of a maintenance plan where improvements to, or
on-going maintenance, would enhance the open space lot or
lots.
(b)
Subject to approval of a management plan by the Planning
Board, the following may be permitted: farming, agriculture,
horticulture, silviculture, and the harvesting of crops, flowers
and hay.

§ 240-17 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE § 240-17
232:341
In cases where the open space has been environmentally damaged
prior to the completion of the development as a result of land
clearance, grading, soil removal, excavation, harvesting of trees,
refuse disposal, structures, or any other activity deemed
inappropriate with the proposed uses of the common open space,
the Planning Board may require the developer to restore or
improve the condition and appearance of the common open space,
and may require the posting of security, in a form and amount to
be determined by the Planning Board, to ensure such restoration
or improvement.
(6)

2 Maximum lot coverage pertains to building footprint only.
3 Applies to mixed use development only.
4 See also setbacks in Subsection (1) below.
Setbacks.
Maximum building setback.
The maximum building setback from the street line shall
be zero feet for the front and street side facade so that the
building visually reinforces the building facade line of the
street. (See Diagram No. 2 below.).
[1]
Existing buildings within the HVB District not currently
located at the zero maximum building setback may be
altered, expanded, replaced or redeveloped so long as the
maximum building setback is equal to the setback of the
buildings(s) in existence upon the adoption of this section
or 20 feet, whichever is less, and provided that the area
between the building setback and the street line shall
provide permanent public plazas, sidewalk cafes, public
spaces or amenities and/or landscaping.
[2]
The SPGA may vary the maximum building setback for
the building facade, or any portion thereof, and may allow
buildings to be set back from the front and/or street side
property line where it would result in better alignment
of buildings, improved design of the building facade, or
where necessary to accommodate shop entrances,
arcades, plazas, sidewalk cafes, permanent public spaces,
pocket parks, or landscaping required pursuant to the
provisions of this section or as allowed by permit, and so
[3]
(a)
(1)
§ 240-24.1.3 BARNSTABLE CODE § 240-24.1.3
232:372
long as such increase in building setback will not create
significant interruption of the alignment of any sidewalk
constructed on public or private property or will not
otherwise interfere with pedestrian access.
Awnings, marquees and balconies. The SPGA may provide
relief from the zero front yard setback for awnings, marquees
and balconies. These building structures are allowed to
protrude up to five feet past the property line into the public
right-of-way. All awnings, marquees and open air balconies
shall require a license from the Town Manager consistent with
Barnstable General Ordinances, Part 1, Chapter 121, § 121-6J.
Awnings and Marquees
Open Air Balconies
(b)
Height.
Maximum building height.
The maximum height of buildings or structures, other than
accessory rooftop equipment discussed below or special
architectural features, is 42 feet or three stories not to
exceed 46 feet.
[1]
Maximum height may be increased to 46 feet or three
stories when the roof pitch is in the range of six in 12.
[2]
In order to reduce shadows on Hyannis Main Street, for
lots located on the southerly edge of the layout of Hyannis
Main Street between Barnstable Road/Ocean Street and
Sea Street, the maximum building height within 25 feet of
the layout of Hyannis Main Street shall not exceed 35 feet
unless a special permit is obtained from the SPGA. (See
Diagram No. 3 below.)

Height of rooftop equipment. Accessory rooftop equipment
may extend to 46 feet {or to 50 feet when the building height is
allowed at 46 feet under Subsection [(2)(a)[2] above}, provided
that it is set back from the exterior wall(s) by at least 10 feet,
and is enclosed or screened with materials compatible with the
building, and the headhouse and screening are not visible from
the ground. Accessory equipment shall not exceed 20% of the
roof area. Eight-foot tall roof headhouse structures shall be set
back from the exterior wall(s) by at least 10 feet, and shall not
exceed 20% of the roof area.
(b)
Facade length. Buildings or portions of a building with a mass
over 50 feet wide must divide their elevations into smaller parts. A
pronounced change in massing, pronounced changes in wall planes
and introducing significant variations in the cornice/roofline are all
possible methods to accomplish the desired divisions of elevations
into smaller parts.
(3)
Roof pitch. Flat roofs shall not extend for more than 50 linear feet,
unless otherwise permitted by special permit.
(4)

to allow for passageways to parking at the rear of the lots and
adjoining streets.
(b)
Ground floor windows.
All new nonresidential development shall provide ground floor
windows along street facades, including windows that allow
views into working areas or lobbies, pedestrian entrances, or
display windows. Required windows shall have a sill no more
than four feet above grade. Where interior floor levels prohibit
such placement, the sill may be raised to no more than two feet
above the finished floor level, up to a maximum sill height of
six feet above grade.

Windows that block two-way visibility, such as darkly tinted
and mirrored windows, are prohibited as ground floor windows
along street facades.
(b)
Any wall which is within 30 feet of the street shall contain at
least 20% of the ground floor wall area facing the street in
display areas, windows, or doorways. Blank walls, including
walls that do not include display areas, windows, architectural
features, and/or doorways, are prohibited.

(6)
Through lots.
Through lots defined. A "through lot" shall be a lot with a
lot line of at least 10 feet on Hyannis Main Street that also
abuts on another public street or way (the "alternative street
or way"), but shall not include a corner lot. A through lot with
at least 10 feet of property line abutting Hyannis Main Street
is presumed to have frontage on Hyannis Main Street.

required as follows:
Off-site parking. Parking requirements may be satisfied if an
off-street municipal parking lot of 20 spaces or more exists
within 500 feet of the proposed use and provided that a fee
is paid which would be set aside for the creation of future
municipal parking facilities to service the district, consistent
with a schedule of fees, if any, to be adopted in the Design and
Infrastructure Plan. Off-site parking may also be provided on
a private parking lot with sufficient parking spaces within 300
feet of the proposed use, provided that a lease agreement is
presented as part of the site plan approval or special permit
process and provided that a fee is paid which would be set

Reduce congestion on lot access streets which also serve
residential areas; and
(6)
Contribute to traffic safety by ensuring orderly access to and
egress from such lots.

such services, and the time schedule for providing those services.
Without limitation, the DIP may establish standards related to the
following:
The Design and Infrastructure Plan shall establish a process for
permit applicants to challenge ITE assumptions regarding trip
generation (vehicle trips per day). Based upon generally accepted
engineering, legal and planning standards, the Design and
Infrastructure Plan may modify the definition of peak hour roadway

E(1)(a)[1].
Expansions or modifications. A project shall be considered
an expansion or modification where any alterations to an

Development as described in Subsection E(1)(b) below:
An expansion of the footprint of a building by more
than 20%.
[a]
More than 50% of the exterior walls or 50% of the roof

Advisory site plan review and provisions.
Findings. Owing to their physical characteristic and the nature
of their operations, a regional shopping center may affect
neighboring properties and adjacent sidewalks and streets. It is in
the interest of the community to promote functional and aesthetic
design, construction and maintenance of a regional shopping
center and to minimize any harmful affects on surrounding areas.
(1)
Purposes. The provisions of this section are designed to assure
that all development activities associated with a regional shopping
center will be carried out in furtherance of the purposes articulated
in § 240-39A, taking into account the existing condition of the
redevelopment area, the large-scale character of developments
such as the regional shopping center, the customary site layout of
regional shopping centers, and the necessity to permit natural light
to illuminate the common areas of the regional shopping center
(hereinafter referred to as the "design constraints").
(2)
Advisory site plan review/when required. The provisions of this
§ 240-39L shall apply to development within the Shopping Center
Redevelopment Overlay District in lieu of the site plan review

§ 240-39 BARNSTABLE CODE § 240-39
232:472
provisions of Article IX of this chapter. At least 60 days prior to
filing any DRI application with the Cape Cod Commission, the
proponent of a regional shopping center shall make an informal
filing with the Building Commissioner, in draft form, of such plans
and materials relating to the DRI application as the proponent
intends to file with the Commission with its DRI application and
such relevant plans and materials relating to the MEPA process
as are then available. Within 30 days following such informal
submission, the Building Commissioner and other members of the
Site Plan Review Committee established under Article IX of this
chapter and such other Town staff as may be designated by the
Building Commissioner shall review, comment upon and make
recommendations with respect to the plans and materials so
submitted, provided that the Building Commissioner shall have the
right to extend such thirty-day period by an additional 30 days
at the request of the Site Plan Review Committee. In conducting
its review the Site Plan Review Committee shall consider the
consistency of such plans and materials with the site development
standards set forth in Subsection L(4) hereof. The informal filing
and review described in this Subsection L(3) requires no approval
and therefore does not constitute a development permit within the
meaning of the Cape Cod Commission Act (Chapter 716 of the
Acts of 1989) or the Regional Policy Plan promulgated pursuant
thereto; however, the Cape Cod Commission shall be invited to
have representatives participate in the advisory site plan review
process.
Site development standards.
A reasonable effort shall be made to improve, conserve and
protect natural features that are of some lasting benefit to the
site, its environs and the community at large.
(a)
Slopes which exceed 10% shall be protected by appropriate
measures against erosion, runoff, and unstable soil, trees and
rocks. Measures shall be taken to stabilize the land surface
from unnecessary disruption. Such stabilization measures shall
be the responsibility of the property owner.
(b)
The placement of buildings, structures, fences, lighting and
fixtures on each site shall not interfere with traffic circulation,
safety, appropriate use and enjoyment of adjacent properties.
(c)
At any driveway, a visibility triangle shall be provided in which
nothing shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow
so as to materially impede vision from within motor vehicles
between a height of three feet and eight feet above the average
center-line grades of the intersecting street and driveway, said
triangle being bounded by the intersection of the street line
and the edges of a driveway an a line joining points along said
lines 20 feet distant from their projected intersection.
(d)
(4)
§ 240-39 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE § 240-39
232:473
Adequate illumination shall be provided to parking lots and
other areas for vehicular and pedestrian circulation. All
illumination shall be directed and/or shielded so as not to
interfere with traffic beyond the perimeter of the site.
(e)
All areas designed for vehicular use shall be paved with a
minimum of either a 2 1/2 inches bituminous asphalt concrete,
a six-inch portland cement concrete pavement, or other
surface, such as brick or cobblestone, as approved by the Town
Engineer.
(f)
All parking spaces shall be arranged and clearly marked in
accordance with the parking lot design standards contained in
§ 240-39J herein. Signs and pavement markings shall be used
as appropriate to control approved traffic patterns.
(g)
The provisions of § 240-52 of this chapter shall not apply to
land within the Shopping Center Redevelopment Overlay
District. Instead, exterior landscaping of a regional shopping
center shall be subject to review in connection with the
advisory site plan review process described herein.
(h)
All utility service transmission systems, including but not
limited to water, sewer, natural gas, electrical and telephone
lines, shall, whenever practicable, be placed underground.
Electric, telephone, cable TV, and other such utilities shall
be underground, except for transformers, electric switching
boxes or similar equipment and gas meters, which may be
above ground.
(i)
All surface water runoff from structures and impervious
surfaces shall be disposed of on site, but in no case shall
surface water drainage be across sidewalks or public or private
ways. In no case shall surface water runoff be drained directly
into wetlands or water bodies (except for drainage structures
in place as of the effective date of this § 240-39). All drainage
systems shall be designed to minimize the discharge of
pollutants by maximizing appropriately designed vegetated
drainage channels and sedimentation basins that allow for
adequate settling of suspended solids and maximum
infiltration (with due regard to the design constraints). Dry
wells, leaching pits and other similar drainage structures may
be used only where other methods are not practicable. Subject
to ambient surcharge conditions, roof runoff shall be
recharged to the ground via a system of dry wells and/or
infiltration systems. Nontoxic roof materials shall be used to
minimize the leaching of toxic materials to the groundwater.
To minimize water utilization, all new plumbing fixtures shall
be designed to meet water conservation measures as required
under the State Building and Plumbing Codes. All such
drainage structures shall be preceded by oil, grease and
(j)
§ 240-39 BARNSTABLE CODE § 240-39
232:474
sediment traps to facilitate removal of contaminants. All
calculations shall be for a twenty-fiver-year storm and shall be
reviewed by the Town Engineer. The materials submitted shall
include provision for an appropriate maintenance program for
such drainage structures to be implemented and maintained by
the proponent. The materials submitted shall show adequate
measures to mitigate pollution of surface or groundwater to
minimize erosion and sedimentation. All drainage shall be
designed so that all runoff shall be disposed of on site,
groundwater recharge is maximized, and neighboring
properties will not be adversely affected.
The materials submitted shall describe estimated average daily
and peak hour vehicle trips to be generated by the site and
traffic flow showing adequate access to and from the site
and adequate circulation within the site taking into account
the Barnstable/Yarmouth Transportation Study. The proponent
of a regional shopping center will include in such materials
reasonable measures to lower traffic demand to the regional
shopping center such as, by way of example only, working
with other major retailers along the 132 corridor to promote
bus and shuttle bus activity, encouraging carpooling among
employees, and/or similar measures, which materials shall be
referred to as the "Traffic Demand Management Plan."
Reasonable efforts shall be made to provide vehicular and
pedestrian connections within the redevelopment area to
adjoining properties devoted to retail use.
(k)
Special permit provisions.
Special permit for regional shopping center.
No building permit or occupancy permit shall be issued for
any expansion of a regional shopping center which increases
the gross floor area of the regional shopping center above that
existing on the effective date of this § 240-39 by more than
50,000 square feet of gross floor area unless the Zoning Board
of Appeals has issued a special permit approving such use in
accordance with the provisions of this § 240-39M. In addition,
no building permit or occupancy permit shall be issued for
a drive-through bank or drive-through restaurant unless the
Zoning Board of Appeals has issued a special permit or a
modification of a special permit issued under this section,
approving such use, subject to the provisions of this
§ 240-39M. [Amended 9-18-2008 by Order No. 2009-08;
5-7-2015 by Order No. 2015-071]
(a)
A special permit for a regional shopping center may provide for
phased development (and, if applicable, a projected phasing
plan shall be provided to the Board of Appeals as part of the
special permit process under § 240-39M). A special permit for
(b)
(1)
M.
§ 240-39 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE § 240-39
232:475
a regional shopping center shall become void two years from
the date of issue unless any construction work contemplated
thereby (or first phase thereof, if applicable) shall commence
and proceed in good faith continuously to completion, or, if no
construction work is contemplated by the special permit, the
use authorized thereby is commenced.
Any work done in deviation from a special permit granted
pursuant to this § 240-39M shall be a violation of this chapter,
unless such deviation is approved in writing by the Zoning
Board of Appeals. However, a special permit may be granted
based upon plans showing one or more permissible building
areas and/or permissible parking structure areas, in which
buildings and other structures are to be located, rather than
with the locations of the buildings and other structures finally
established. Provided the boundaries of such permissible
building areas and/or permissible parking structure areas are
approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals in connection with
the special permit, once the special permit is granted, no
separate approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals will be
required for the actual location of the buildings or
improvements within such permissible building areas and/or
permissible parking structure areas [provided that no material
change to the design or materials described in § 240-39M(2)(a)
shall be made without the approval of the Zoning Board of
Appeals.] The Zoning Board of Appeals may amend or modify
a special permit upon the application of the developer of a
regional shopping center and, if the Zoning Board of Appeals
determines that such amendment or modification is minor in
nature, such amendment or modification may be approved
without a hearing upon the submission of plans and
information that may, in the discretion of the Zoning Board
of Appeals, be less extensive than the plans and information
required in this § 240-39M. Amendments or modifications
determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals not to be minor in
nature shall require a public hearing.
(c)
The purpose of the special permit for a regional shopping
center is to assure that the development of a regional shopping
center is carried out in a manner which is (1) consistent with
the purposes set forth in § 240-39A hereof and the site
development standards set forth in § 240-39L(4) hereof, (2)
consistent with the terms and conditions of any DRI permit
issued by the Cape Cod Commission and the certificate of the
Secretary of Environmental Affairs on the final environmental
impact report, (3) with due regard given to the Design
Guidelines for Cape Cod prepared by the Cape Cod
Commission in light of the design constraints, and (4)
consistent with such additional reasonable conditions as may
be imposed by the Zoning Board of Appeals as are not
(d)
§ 240-39 BARNSTABLE CODE § 240-39
232:476
inconsistent with the foregoing. The Zoning Board of Appeals
shall grant a special permit for a regional shopping center
upon its determination that the standards for the issuance
of such special permit set forth in this Subsection M(1)(d)
have been complied with, giving due regard to the design
constraints.
Required contents of special permit application. The application for
a special permit under this § 240-39M shall include:

of its special permit the performance of any written
commitments made by the developer of a regional shopping
center to the Zoning Board of Appeals, the Planning Board
or the Town Council intended to reduce or limit the impacts,
financial or otherwise, of the regional shopping center on the
Town. Such conditions shall be based on the written
information furnished to the Zoning Board of Appeals by the
Planning Board and Town Council. Such conditions shall be
binding on the applicant for such special permit provided they
are consistent with the provisions of Section 15 of Chapter 716
of the Acts of 1989 (the Cape Cod Commission Act).
(d)
The Zoning Board of Appeals may include as a condition of
its special permit that, prior to the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy for the regional shopping center, the Building
Commissioner shall be provided with evidence that the

contemplated in the definition of "regional shopping center"
are in place.
(e)
If the proposed improvements which are the subject of an
application for a special permit under this § 240-39M have
not been subject to the review of the Cape Cod Commission
because at the time of such application the Cape Cod
Commission or the DRI process has been abolished, then the
proposed improvements shall be subject to site plan review
under Article IX of this chapter.

(4)
B.
Conditions and procedural requirements. Prior to the creation of a
family apartment, the owner of the property shall make application
for a building permit with the Building Commissioner providing any

ARTICLE XI
Growth Management
[Added 7-19-2001 by Order No. 2001-11873]
§ 240-110. Authority.
This article is adopted under the authority of the Home Rule Amendment,
Article 89 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, the Cape Cod
Commission Act, Chapter 716 of the Acts of 1989, as amended, MGL Ch.
40A, Ch. 41 §§ 81L through 81GG, and Ch. 111.
§ 240-111. Purposes.
The purpose of this article is to ensure that a harmonious pattern and
predictable rate of development occurs in Barnstable, which protects
the health, safety and welfare of current and future Barnstable
residents. The consequences of the historical and current patterns and
rates of development in Barnstable such as our historic inability to fund
our capital needs and the further degradation of our environmental
assets are described in the Local Comprehensive Plan. The rate of
residential development in Barnstable is determined by and should not
exceed the ability of the Town to provide adequate infrastructure and to
protect the natural environment. In addition, this development rate is
intended to further the legitimate commonwealth and local interests in
the provision of a fair share of housing that is affordable to persons with
both low and moderate incomes. This development rate will also guard
against potential increases in the growth rate, which could adversely
affect the Town's environmental resources, economy and land values.
A.
This article establishes a development rate adequate to ensure that the
Town, with prudent reliance on local and other financial sources and in
compliance with the revenue generating guidelines of Proposition 2 1/
2, can and will provide infrastructure and operate in a manner which
provides current and future Barnstable residents with an adequate and
responsible level of Town services, as defined by relevant, commonly
accepted professional standards. This article also establishes a
development rate adequate to ensure that the Town has the ability to
implement its affordable housing goals, as set forth in the Barnstable
Local Comprehensive Plan as updated by the Barnstable Affordable
Housing Plan dated January 31, 2001.74
B.
It is anticipated by this article that during the time until buildout
occurs, the Town will strive to upgrade its infrastructure to keep pace
C.
73.Note: The following Growth Management Ordinance is a DCPC (District of Critical
Planning Concern) implementing regulation. The DCPC was approved by the Barnstable
Assembly of Delegates on September 5, 2001; and the Cape Cod Commission gave its final
approval on September 20, 2001. The Commission also approved this ordinance (originally
approved by the Barnstable Town Council on July 19, 2001) as the implementing
regulation on September 20, 2001. This implementing ordinance became a part of the
Zoning Ordinance on September 21, 2001.

entire structure; however, only three dwelling units shall receive a
certificate of occupancy per building permit issued.
CERTIFICATE OF AFFORDABILITY — A certificate issued by the Barnstable
Office of Community Development authorizing an applicant to apply for a

with its total population, as outlined in the Capital Improvements Plan
and consistent with the growth rate established by this article. This
includes the preparation of a long-term capital plan and a commitment
to make contributions, as practical, to infrastructure and to the
established Capital Trust Fund as appropriate to fund infrastructure,
promote affordable housing and protect the environment.
Subject to a valid Chapter 40B comprehensive permit and meeting
the requirements of the Commonwealth's Department of Housing and
Community Development (the "DHCD") to be counted as affordable in
the state count toward the 10% goal, as that goal may be amended by

Otherwise meeting the affordability requirements of the DHCD as
evidenced by receipt of a certificate of affordability, as defined below.
B.
§ 240-111 BARNSTABLE CODE § 240-112
232:560
provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation. The term
"residential dwelling unit" shall not include family apartments, group homes
and congregate facilities, hotels, motels, and other uses that are not
considered residential for purposes of zoning, as determined by the Town
Attorney.[Amended 2-28-2008 by Order No. 2008-089]
SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL INTEREST — A one-percent or greater legal

TOWN MANAGER — The Town Manager or his designee(s).
§ 240-113. Effective date and applicability.
§ 240-114. Rate of residential development.
Effective date. The provisions of this article shall take effect upon the
termination of the limited moratorium establishing a lottery system for
the issuance of building permits, as established through the District of
Critical Planning Concern nomination under the provisions of Sections
10 and 11 of the Cape Cod Commission Act.
A.
Applicability. This article applies to all new residential construction,
including new structures and expansions, changes or alterations of
existing structures that result in an increase in residential dwelling
units, as that term is defined in § 240-112 above. It is intended that
the cap established by this article shall apply to both market-rate
units and affordable units. The development of additional dwelling units
protected by MGL, Ch. 40A, § 6 shall be subject to the delays imposed
by this growth management article; provided, however, this article is
not intended to diminish the ability ultimately to construct a dwelling
unit.
B.
Affordable growth rate. Subject to adjustments provided in this Article
XI, the Building Commissioner shall issue building permits for
construction of additional affordable dwelling units only if the
aggregate of permits issued therefor will not result in authorizing
construction, within each consecutive calendar year, of greater than
36 additional affordable dwelling units (the "annual affordable
distribution"). In the event the Building Commissioner is required
pursuant to a Chapter 40B comprehensive permit to issue affordable
permit(s) in excess of the annual affordable distribution, or the Town
Manager authorizes issuance of affordable permit(s) pursuant to a
certificate of affordability in excess of the annual affordable
distribution, future annual affordable distribution(s) shall be decreased
by the same number, as necessary. In the event the Building
Commissioner does not issue all of the affordable permits made
available through an annual affordable distribution, as adjusted, the

232:561
next calendar year annual affordable distribution shall be increased by
the amount of remaining affordable permits.
Market growth rate.
Subject to adjustments provided in this Article XI, the Building
Commissioner shall issue building permits for construction of
additional market rate residential dwelling units only if the
aggregate of permits issued therefor will not result in authorizing
construction, within each consecutive calendar year, of greater
than 96 market permits (the "annual market distribution"). In the
event the Building Commissioner is required to issue market
permit(s) in excess of the annual market distribution pursuant
to Subsection D, Adjustments, below, future annual market
distribution(s) shall be decreased by the same number, as
necessary.

In order to lessen the impact of this article at the time of its
adoption, this article:
Contains the following graduated scale for implementation of
the target growth rate:
Graduated Annual Market Distribution Schedule
Year Market Permits
2002 132
2003 126
2004 108

No person shall submit a building permit application within 10
days from the date of their last building permit application in
which they have a substantial financial interest, and no person

given month, no person or entity shall receive more than three
building permits in which the person or entity has a substantial
financial interest.

§ 240-114 BARNSTABLE CODE § 240-114
232:562
§ 240-115. Issuance of residential building permits.
During calendar year 2001 no person shall receive more than
30 building permits in which they have a substantial financial
interest. Any person issued 30 or more building permits in
calendar year 2001 permits in which they have a substantial
financial interest shall, upon receipt of the 30th building
permit, immediately withdraw all pending building permit
application(s); said withdrawn application(s) may be
resubmitted consistent with the terms of the preceding
subsection.
(c)
Chapter 40B permits. It is the intention of the Town to phase the
development of all residential dwelling units constructed under the
provisions of Chapter 40B. Within Chapter 40B comprehensive permit
developments, those units that are included in the DHCD tally of
affordable units counted toward the affordable goal, as determined by
the Town, shall apply for affordable permits. Those units that are not
included in the DHCD count toward the affordable goal, as determined
by the Town, shall apply for market permits.
C.
Adjustments. The following activities shall result in the adjustment of
annual affordable and market distributions, as the case may be:

provisions of the State Building Code shall be added to the next
annual distribution. Building permits issued pursuant to this article
shall be exercised in a continuous and expeditious manner.
Construction shall commence within six months of issuance of
a building permit; provided, however, that the Building
Commissioner shall grant one six-month extension upon request.
(1)
Single lot protection. A building permit to construct a market-rate
single-family dwelling unit on a lot in single ownership, to be owned
and occupied by the owner of that parcel of land, applied for but
not issued within 24 months from the date of filing shall be issued,
and future annual market distributions shall be decreased by the
same amount, if necessary.
(2)
Other required permits. Permits required to be issued under
Chapter 40B or by a final court or administrative order shall be
issued as required, and future annual affordable and/or market
distributions, as the case may be, shall be decreased by the same
amount, if necessary.
(3)
Borrowing against future distributions. In the event that no market
permits are available to be issued in a given month, the Building
Commissioner shall issue six market permits in that month and
shall decrease subsequent annual market distribution(s) by the
same number.

market permits within each month, the Building Commissioner
shall determine the number of market permits remaining available
within the annual market distribution and shall increase or
decrease the number of available market permits consistent with
any adjustments required by § 240-114D above. The Building
Commissioner shall then divide the number of available market
permits by the number of months remaining in the calendar year,
which shall be the number of market permits issued within that
month. Fractions shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
number and added to subsequent monthly calculations.

Commissioner shall determine the number of affordable permits
remaining available within the annual affordable distribution and

permits consistent with any adjustments required by § 240-114A
and D above. The Building Commissioner shall then divide the
number of available affordable permits by the number of months
remaining in the calendar year, which shall be the number of
affordable permits issued within that month. Fractions shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number and added to
subsequent monthly calculations.
(2)
In the event that no affordable or market permits are available to
be issued in a given month, only those permits requiring issuance
or authorized for issuance pursuant to § 240-114A and D above
shall be issued until any adjustments result in additional available
permits or the next annual distribution becomes available.
(3)
A.
Limitations and transferability of building permits. The following
restrictions shall apply to the submission of building permit
applications and the issuance of building permits:

In order to be deemed complete, applications for affordable
permits shall include a valid certificate of affordability or shall
include a copy of a valid Chapter 40B comprehensive permit

§ 240-131.2. District boundaries. [Adopted 1-19-2011 by Ord. No.
11-01 of the Barnstable County Assembly of Delegates pursuant to
Ch. 716 of the Acts of 1989 (Cape Cod Commission Act)]
The purpose and intent of §§ 240-131 through 240-131.8 are to guide
development in the Craigville Beach District pursuant to the Guidelines
of Barnstable County Ordinance 09-10 to ensure that development and
redevelopment:
Contributes to and respects the character and historic
development patterns of the area and minimizes inconsistent
development and redevelopment impacts to the historic and
community character resources in this area;
(1)
Protects and preserves scenic views and vistas and ways to the
water;
(2)
Protects and improves natural resources, including but not limited
to the barrier beach and groundwater and coastal water quality
and minimizes development and redevelopment impacts to the
natural resources and ecosystems in this district;
(3)
Protects human life and property from the hazards of periodic
flooding;
(4)
Preserves the natural flood control characteristics and the flood
control function of the floodplain;
(5)
Preserves and maintains the groundwater table and water
recharge areas within the floodplain. As the entire complex of
coastal wetland resources moves landward due to relative sea level
rise, the Craigville Beach area's coastal floodplains immediately
landward of salt marshes, coastal beaches, barrier beaches, coastal
dunes, and coastal banks require special protection.

said regulations if compliance with the regulation substantially
diminishes or detracts from the usefulness of a proposed
development or impairs the character of the development so as to
affect its intended use; provided, however, that the relief granted
will not create a public safety hazard along adjacent roadways and
will not adversely impact natural resources or create a nuisance
or adverse impacts to other surrounding properties. A modification
permit shall be subject to the same procedural requirements as a
special permit, except that approval of a modification permit shall
require a simple majority of the members of the Board.

The reestablishment of a lawfully established conforming or
nonconforming use and/or building or structure which has been
destroyed or damaged by fire, acts of nature or other catastrophe
shall be permitted as of right, provided that the Building
Commissioner has determined that all the following conditions are
met:
The reconstruction or repair will not materially increase the
gross floor area or height of the building or structure beyond
that which previously existed, nor materially increase the
footprint of the structure; or materially change the grade other
than grades required for installation or upgrade of on-site
septic systems; except that buildings in the floodplain that
existed prior to November 6, 2009, may be elevated two feet
above BFE or as required by the applicable law regardless
of the resulting building height, provided that the building
complied with building height regulations at the time of its

dimensional requirements and design guidelines to preserve the
distinctive character; allow continued use and enjoyment of properties
and structures; make provisions for changes and expansions; protect
and preserve scenic views and vistas; protect and improve natural
resources; and limit damage from periodic flood events for each
neighborhood within the Craigville Beach District.
A.
Historic and community character. These regulations will ensure that
development and redevelopment in the CBD contribute to and do not
detract from the historic character of the Craigville Beach area; that
any proposed additions to historic structures shall be consistent with
the historic structure and shall be consistent with the character of the
surrounding neighborhood, including elements such as building height,
B.
§ 240-131.6 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE § 240-131.7
232:615
mass and orientation; and preserve views and ways to the water from
public spaces, streets and ways.
Applicability. Development and redevelopment shall be subject to the
following additional requirements and regulations based upon the
applicable Neighborhood Overlay.
C.
General performance standards.
The development complies with the setbacks and lot coverage
requirements set forth herein, and is in character with surrounding
structures, particularly structures that predate it unless relief has
been granted by the SPGA in accordance with § 240-131.4D and E.
(1)
The development complies with the height limitations set forth
herein.
(2)
Exposed foundation walls for raised septic systems and/or elevated
structures are prohibited; foundation walls shall be screened
through the use of foundation plantings and/or the use of other
natural materials.
(3)
Stormwater management and erosion control for nonresidential
uses comply with best management practices through low-impact
development or other adaptive management practice.
(4)
Up to 50 square feet of roof deck may be allowed atop the first
or second floor of a structure if the railing and support structure
for the roof deck are constructed fully below the tallest part of the
roofline they are contained within.
(5)
All new non-water-dependent development shall be set back at
least 50 feet from the top of the coastal bank resource area.
Change, alteration, or expansion of existing structures shall not be
sited closer to the top of the coastal bank resource area than the
existing development to the maximum extent feasible.
(6)
Existing natural vegetation within the fifty-foot buffer area to salt
marsh and undisturbed buffer areas 50 feet landward of the mean
high-water mark of coastal water bodies shall be preserved to the
maximum extent feasible.
(7)
No direct untreated stormwater discharges shall be permitted into
any coastal waters or wetlands, including discharges above or
below the mean high water level. Stormwater discharge shall be

New septic systems shall be prohibited in V Zones except to
upgrade existing failed systems where such systems pose a
demonstrated threat to public health, water quality, or natural
resources.
(b)
Any activity or development in a V Zone that creates an
adverse effect by increasing elevation or velocity of
floodwaters due to a change in drainage or flowage
characteristics on the subject site, adjacent properties or any
public or private way is prohibited. Any proposed activity shall
not result in flood damage due to filling which causes lateral
displacement of floodwaters that, in the judgment of the SPGA,
would otherwise be confined to said area. The burden of proof
for this standard rests with the applicant and shall require
certification by a professional engineer.
(c)
Open foundations shall be designed to accommodate only the
height required to elevate the lowest structural member two
feet above the BFE in V Zones and one foot above BFE in A
Zones. For all new construction and substantial improvements
within the V Zones, the space below the lowest floor must
either be free of obstruction or constructed with
nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or

Beach club design guidelines.
Purpose: to maintain public views to the water and to maintain
the neighborhood's existing character with small-scale
building masses and natural or traditional building materials.
(a)
Building height and massing. New construction on beach club
properties shall have modest massings to relate to the small
scale of most structures in the beachfront neighborhood. Any
structure with a footprint of 3,000 square feet or more shall
incorporate significant changes in massing to break up the
facade and should integrate one-story massings into the design
to relate the building to the surrounding smaller structures.
(b)
Building orientation. Buildings shall be oriented with the
narrow end facing the street and the water to maximize public
views of the water across the site. New buildings or complexes
should not extend over more than 150 feet of the lot frontage,
and efforts should be made to limit the expansion of existing
buildings.
(c)
Maintaining views to water. Multiple buildings on one lot
should be clustered close together to limit obstructed views of
the water, or shall be separated from each other by 100 feet
or more of road frontage to allow broad unobstructed views
across the lot to the water.
(d)
Fences. Fences shall be of open construction and low profile
(such as split rail and low picket fencing) to maintain public
views to the water. Fences over three feet in height should
be limited to screening loading and delivery areas adjacent to
buildings, or modest trash collection areas. Screening fences
should not extend farther than necessary beyond the building
footprint to maintain public views.
(e)
Building materials. Exterior building materials shall be those
traditionally used in the region or other naturally weathering
materials, such as wood shingle, wood clapboard, or board and
batten siding.

altered, provided that there is no increase in gross floor area,
footprint, or intensity of use (including but not limited to
increases in wastewater flow and impervious area) within the
V Zone.
(b)
Any activity or development in a V Zone that creates an
adverse effect by increasing elevation or velocity of
floodwaters due to a change in drainage or flowage
characteristics on the subject site, adjacent properties or any

Permitted accessory uses. Customary and incidental uses and
structures are permitted in the Craigville Village Neighborhood
Overlay area subject to the use limitations and performance
standards listed in § 240-131.7D.
(2)
Neighborhood performance standards. All development and
redevelopment shall meet the following design guidelines:
Purpose. Most buildings in the Craigville Village Neighborhood
date from the late 1800s and early 1900s when the
neighborhood developed as a Christian Camp Meeting
Association. The neighborhood is still defined by its historic
structures and their configuration around a central green,
small street grid, and communal paths.
(a)
Objectives.
To preserve the character-defining features of the original
camp meeting neighborhood, including its small lots,
modest-scale structures, and orientation of buildings to
public areas.
[1]
To ensure that additions and alterations to structures are
compatible with the existing scale and character of the
building and preserve the original massing and unique
architectural features of its historic buildings.
[2]
(b)
Application. The design guidelines set forth herein do not apply
to structures in existence as of the date of the adoption of
§§ 240-131 through 240-131.8, but shall apply to all new
development, to any additions to existing structures, and to
all reconstruction projects except as provided for in
§ 240-131.4F(1)(e).
(c)
Building design. The guidelines shall apply to construction
of new structures and expansions and alterations of existing
structures.
Preserve the original massing of historic structures
(pre-1945).
[1]
Additions should be attached to secondary or less
prominent facades of the building (the side or rear
facades), and should be stepped back from the front and
rear corners of the building so as to preserve the original
massing of the structure, including its roof form.
[2]
Work with modest massings. Additions should be scaled to
be consistent with or smaller than the size of the original
historic structure, following the neighborhood tradition
of expanding small cottages incrementally with modest
additions. Additions should generally have a lower roofline
[3]

11-01 of the Barnstable County Assembly of Delegates pursuant to
Ch. 716 of the Acts of 1989 (Cape Cod Commission Act)]
than the original structure to maintain the prominence
of the original building, though some additions may be
slightly taller than the original structure if attached to the
original structure with a smaller connecting mass.
Roof forms. The roof pitch on new construction and
additions should complement the roof pitch of the original
historic structure and should maintain a pitch of at least
six over 12.
[4]
Retain original architectural details and unique forms.
Additions should be placed so as to limit the removal of

The purpose of this chapter is to establish a program for awarding
certificates of merit to food-handling establishments in the Town of
Barnstable.
§ 322-12. Eligibility; criteria for award.
The certificate of merit is an award given only to restaurant businesses
classified as food service establishments as defined in Article X, Minimum
Standards for Food Establishments, State Sanitary Code, with seating
provided for patrons. The award will not be awarded to churches, public
schools, and retail food stores that may have, or subsequently obtained,
a food-service permit. The award, when given to an establishment, will
inform the public that the establishment has attained and maintained high
sanitation standards over a period of time thereby serving as a stimulus
for other members of the food industry to accomplish the same thing. The
certificate is intended to be displayed prominently and publicly. The award
is based upon sanitary criteria alone and does not reflect aesthetic qualities,
standards of service, menu, price, or any other nonsanitary criteria.
§ 322-13. Qualifications for award.
The certificate is given only to food establishments as defined in § 322-2
above, which have maintained a high degree of sanitation (a score of
90 or above with no critical violations) for three or more regularly
scheduled consecutive inspections performed on a biannual basis and
covering a period of 18 months. "Regularly scheduled inspections"
means routine inspections scheduled by the Department and not those
performed by special request of the licensee.)
A.
Nominees for the award shall have received a minimum sanitation
rating of 90 with no critical violation as determined on the Food
Establishment Inspection Report Form, in accordance with Subsection
A above.
B.
No establishment shall be eligible for an award that has within the past
24 months received:
(1) A rating of less than 75;
Has been recommended for summary suspension due to overt
imminent danger; or
(2)
Had a verified case of food-borne illness affecting two or more
people.
(3)

§ 322-14. Withdrawal of certificate.
§ 322-15. Control of certificates.
The Board of Health will consider nominations for the certificate of
merit award that have been prepared by the Health Inspector at its
regular bimonthly meeting.
D.
The certificate, although awarded to a food-service establishment for
maintaining a high level of sanitation, remains the property of the Town
of Barnstable Health Department and may be withdrawn at any time
by the Board of Health. Withdrawal shall be but is not limited to the
following:
(1) Change of location of establishment.
(2) Verified cases of food-borne illness.
(3) Subsequent score below 90.
(4) Subsequent observation of any critical violations.
A.
Misuse of the certificate that tends to reflect adversely upon the Board
of Health of the Town of Barnstable.
B.
A registry shall be established for the purpose of keeping a record of
certificates awarded. The registry shall contain the address of the food
establishment awarded the certificate, the name of the person licensed
to operate the food-service establishment, the date the certificate was
awarded, and the number of the certificate.
A.
Certificates shall be numbered consecutively beginning with the
number one preceded by the last two numbers of the calendar year,
e.g., the number for the first certificate issued in 1994 will appear as
94-1.
B.
Certificates may not be transferred from one owner to the other without
approval of the Board of Health. In determining whether a certificate
may be transferred, the Board of Health shall consider as binding any
contrary recommendation introduced by the Health Inspector.
C.
An up-to-date list of all restaurants scoring 90 or above on their last
inspection will be posted on the Health Department bulletin board.

necessary. All grease interceptors must be pumped at an interval not to
exceed three months. Maintenance records must be available to the Health
Inspector at all times.
§ 322-20. Violation of state law; enforcement.
Problems with grease at individual establishments constitute a violation
of 105 CMR 595.000, State Sanitary Code Article X: Minimum

A.
The Board of Health intends to vigorously enforce any grease violations

Groundwater Protection
[Adopted 9-6-1983; revised 12-17-2002, effective 3-7-2003 (Section
6.00 of Part VIII of the 1991 Codification as updated through
6-1-1996)]
§ 360-12. Purpose and findings.
§ 360-13. Connection of certain structures to public sewers when
available.
The purpose of this article is the protection of groundwater in the Town
of Barnstable.
A.
The ground resources of the Town of Barnstable are its sole source
of water supply. It is now known and demonstrable that public supply
wells draw water from a substantial land area. It is known from
experience that high-density housing can, over time, cause serious
deterioration of ambient groundwater by nitrate contamination. It has
been proven that nitrate contamination in drinking water can be a
serious public health problem.
B.
Calculations performed by Cape Cod Planning and Economic
Development Commission indicate that individual residential housing
units placed on one -acre parcels will produce the maximum
recommended planning limit of five parts per million (ppm) nitratenitrogen
in groundwater.
C.
The owner of any commercial structure located within an area of
concern as defined in the Town of Barnstable Area of Concern Map,
dated January 16, 2003 (FILE: sewer_aocs2.dgn D.S.T.P.), will be
subject to connecting said structures to public sewer when available.
A.
The owner of any multifamily structure located within an area of
concern as defined in the Town of Barnstable Area of Concern Map,
dated January 16, 2003 (FILE: sewer_aocs2.dgn D.S.T.P.), will be
subject to connecting said structures to public sewer when available.
B.
The owner of any subdivision located within an area of concern as
defined in the Town of Barnstable Area of Concern Map, dated January
16, 2003 (FILE: sewer_aocs2.dgn D.S.T.P.), will be subject to connecting
all dwellings/buildings within the subdivision to public sewer when
available.
C.
The owner or occupant of any building upon land abutting on a public or
private way, in which there is a common sewer, shall connect the same
therewith by a sufficient drain.
D.

§ 360-14. Variances.
Variances to the regulation may be granted by the Board of Health after
a hearing during which the applicant proves that the installation of onsite
sewage disposal system will not have a significant adverse effect on
surface or subsurface public or private water resources. The Board in
granting variances will consider if strict interpretation of this regulation
would do manifest injustice to the applicant; however, the applicant must
demonstrate that the same degree of environmental protection required by
this regulation can be achieved by other means.

Installation of On-Site Sewage Disposal Systems on Marginal Lots
[Adopted 12-17-1985, effective 12-22-1985 (Section 9.00 of Part
VIII of the 1991 Codification as updated through 6-1-1996)]
§ 360-17. Findings.
The filling of marginal lands in close proximity to groundwater in order
to provide for sufficient area to make it suitable for the installation of
a sewage disposal system is not considered an acceptable practice and
such lands are considered as not suitable from a sanitary point of view for
human habitation and for the protection of groundwater and watercourses.
Watercourses are defined in Regulation 15.01, of 310 CMR 15.00, the State
Environmental Code, Title 5, Minimum Requirements for the Subsurface
Disposal of Sanitary Sewage.
§ 360-18. Restrictions.
Subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be located in an area where
there is at least a four-foot depth of naturally occurring pervious soil
below the entire area of the leaching facility and the designated
leaching reserve area. This four-foot depth of naturally occurring
pervious soil must be above maximum groundwater elevation.
A.
The maximum groundwater elevation shall be determined by utilizing
the formula contained in the United States Department of Interior
Geological Survey publication, "Estimating Highest Groundwater
Levels for Construction and Land Use Planning - a Cape Cod,
Massachusetts, Example," dated September 1983, or by observing the
height of the groundwater table when it is at its maximum level or
elevation. Maximum groundwater determinations shall be made during
the wettest season of the year, normally March or April. Allowances
shall be made for high water level if the Board of Health permits the
determination to be made outside the wettest season.

ARTICLE XV
Protection of Saltwater Estuaries
[Adopted 6-30-2008]
§ 360-45. Interim regulations. [Amended 2-10-2009]
Purpose.
The findings of a state-wide estuary investigation indicate that
a substantial portion of the Town's saltwater estuaries are in
jeopardy from the long-term buildup of nitrate-nitrogen, primarily
from the subsurface discharge of sewage effluent. These findings
have caused the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection to establish total maximum daily loads (TMDL) for
nitrogen for the watershed areas of these estuaries. "Watershed" is
defined as the area of land from which water flows downhill into a
particular body of water. In these nitrogen-impaired estuaries the
TMDL will require an actual reduction in the amount of nitratenitrogen
discharged into these embayments. Since most of the
nitrate-nitrogen in these watersheds is from subsurface discharge
of sewerage effluent into the groundwater that flows to these
embayments, and since it is likely that a plan for corrective action
will take years to formulate and implement, the Board is adopting
the following interim regulations to mitigate the adverse impact
to these estuaries from such discharges. The Town has long
recognized the need to protect its water resources and has imposed
discharge limits on subsurface disposal of sewage in other
nitrogen-sensitive areas. The restrictions proposed herein are
similar to those imposed by Town ordinance and/or Board of Health
regulation in other nitrogen sensitive areas in the Town. These
regulations are temporary and will be in effect only until the Town
adopts and implements a Comprehensive Plan to address the
nitrogen reduction required in these estuary systems by the
proposed TMDL.
(1)
To date, final reports have been produced for Popponesset Bay,
Three Bays and the Centerville River watersheds. All three of these
estuary systems will require a reduction in total nitrogen discharge
in order to meet the state-mandated TMDL. Further reports are
expected on Lewis Bay and Barnstable Harbor.
(2)
A.
Restrictions. No permit for the construction of an individual sewage
disposal system on any building lot shall be granted within the
watersheds for the estuaries that have been identified as requiring a
reduction in the current TMDL of nitrate-nitrogen as identified by the
map entitled "Massachusetts Estuary Project, Zones of Contribution to
Saltwater Estuaries, Town of Barnstable, March 10, 2008," unless the
following standards are met:
The maximum allowable discharge of sanitary sewage, based on
the sewage design flow criteria listed in 310 CMR 15.203, Title 5,
(1)
B.
§ 360-45 MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS § 360-45
346:829
of the State Environmental Code, shall not exceed 440 gallons per
40,000 square feet of lot area, with the following exceptions:
For approved building lots on which no building currently
exists and that are less than 30,000 square feet in area, the
maximum allowable sewage discharge shall be 330 gallons.
(a)
For parcels with existing buildings, the maximum allowable
flow shall be either 440 gallons per 40,000 square feet, except
as described in Subsection B(1)(a) above or whatever is
currently permitted, whichever is greater.
(b)
Nothing in this regulation shall prohibit the approval by the Board
of Health of any application involving the maintenance, repair
or alteration of an existing individual sewage disposal system,
provided that said application does not involve an increase in
design flow as defined by existing Board of Health regulations.
Where an increase in design flow is involved, the applicant must
demonstrate compliance with this regulation.
(2)
Variances. A variance from this regulation may be granted by the Board
of Health only if the applicant can demonstrate that:
(1) Connection to Town sewer is not available; and
(2) That enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice; and
The alternative proposal will provide the same degree of
environmental protection as a design in full conformance with
this regulation. This standard shall be met by a site/septic design
which results in equilibrium concentrations of nitrate/nitrogen at
the down-gradient property line not exceeding five ppm, utilizing
the Cape Cod Commission formulas found in its Technical Bulletin
91-001 (final). In undertaking this calculation, the applicant may
utilize off-site lands located elsewhere in the Estuaries
Contribution Area as defined by the map entitled "Massachusetts
Estuary Project, Zones of Contribution to Saltwater Estuaries,
Town of Barnstable, March 10, 2008," provided that:
The existing nitrogen loading for the off-site property is
included in the calculations; and
(a)
A deed restriction limiting the off-site property to the current
nitrogen loading as stated in the calculations and running to
the Barnstable Board of Health or other entity suitable to that
Board is recorded at the Barnstable Registry of Deeds in the
titles to both the subject property and the off-site property. The
restriction shall be in a form suitable to the Barnstable Town
Attorney. Proof of recording shall be provided to the Board of
Health, the Town Assessing Department and the Town Building
Department prior to the issuance of a DWIP for the subject
property.

Findings; Legislative Authority
§ 371-2. Findings.
The 1986 Surgeon General's Report on "The Health Consequences of
Involuntary Smoking" clearly documents that nonsmokers are placed
at risk for developing disease as a result of exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke or secondhand smoke. In 1993, the Environmental
Protection Agency classified environmental tobacco smoke as a known
human carcinogen. Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke
is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing
secondhand smoke is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in
nonsmokers.
A.
Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke presents a serious and
substantial public health risk. Of particular concern is the workplace
environment of nonsmokers, where they may be subjected to sustained,
involuntary exposure. At special risk are children, the elderly,
individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired
respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive
airway disease.
B.
The United States Department of Health and Human Services has
concluded that nicotine is as addictive as cocaine or heroin, and the
Surgeon General found that nicotine exposure during adolescence,
a critical window for brain development, may have lasting adverse
consequences for brain development. In addition, the Institute of
Medicine (IOM) concluded that raising the minimum age of legal access
to tobacco products to 21 will likely reduce tobacco initiation,
particularly among adolescents 15 to 17, which would improve health
across the lifespan and save lives. Research on raising the minimum
legal drinking age to 21 has reduced alcohol consumption among youth
and protected drinkers from long-term negative outcomes in adulthood,
including alcohol and other drug dependence.
C.
Studies have shown that vending machines afford an opportunity for
unauthorized sale of cigarettes to minors. Evidence further
demonstrates that tobacco is extremely addictive. Approximately 80%
of all smokers begin smoking before age 18 and more than 3,000 young
people begin smoking every day in this nation.
D.
The Cape Cod Regional Tobacco Control Program Advisory Panel
(comprised of representatives of the Boards of Health from the Towns
of Barnstable, Bourne, Brewster, Chatham, Dennis, Eastham, Falmouth,
Harwich, Mashpee, Nantucket, Orleans, Provincetown, Sandwich,
Truro, Wareham, Wellfleet and Yarmouth) urges all public places and
workplaces to become voluntarily smoke-free before November 1,
1996.
E.
§ 371-2 MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS § 371-2
346:845
§ 371-3. Authority.
This regulation is promulgated under the authority granted to the
Barnstable Board of Health pursuant to MGL c. 111, § 31, that "[b]oards
of health may make reasonable health regulations." It is also promulgated
pursuant to MGL c. 270, § 22(j), which states in part that "[n]othing in
this section shall permit smoking in an area in which smoking is or may
hereafter be prohibited by law including, without limitation: any other
law or...health...regulation. Nothing in this section shall preempt further
limitation of smoking by the commonwealth or...political subdivision of the
commonwealth."
Environmental tobacco smoke is a leading public health problem in the
Town of Barnstable and throughout the United States; and
F.
There exists conclusive evidence that environmental tobacco smoke
causes cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, negative
birth outcomes, allergies and irritations to the eyes, ears, nose and
throat of both smokers and nonsmokers; and
G.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated
environmental tobacco smoke to be a Class A carcinogen, similar to
radon and asbestos, with no known safe level of exposure; and
H.
Children, the elderly, individuals with cardiovascular disease,
individuals with impaired respiratory function, and asthmatics are
among those people who are particularly susceptible to the harmful
effects of inhaling environmental tobacco smoke.

applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of the Town of Barnstable.106
§ 376-3. Agricultural license. [Amended 11-14-2006]
For purposes of these regulations, "agriculture" includes the raising or
keeping of horses, whether as a commercial enterprise or incident to
farming as defined in MGL c. 111, § 1, in a manner consistent with
normal, generally accepted farming practices and not injurious to the
public health. If a person (the "owner") provides satisfactory evidence

Will enjoy a rebuttable presumption that the owner is so engaged
in a manner that is not injurious to the public health;
(1)
Will be conditionally exempt from having to demonstrate
compliance with §§ 376-5 through 376-16 of the Board of Health
regulations; and
(2)
(3) Will be issued a stable license.
A.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board is presented with sufficient
evidence that the owner has failed to act in a manner consistent with
normal, generally accepted farming practices and finds that such
failures may possibly be injurious to the public health, then the
presumption set forth in Subsection A(1) and (2) above and the
conditional exemption set forth in Subsection A(3) above will be
suspended, whereupon the Board will forthwith convene a hearing.
B.
If, after the hearing, the Board finds that the owner is engaged in
practices that are injurious to the public health, then the conditional
presumptions in Subsection A(1) above shall be deemed rebutted, the
conditional exemption in Subsection A(2) above will be lost, and the
practices shall cease until the owner is in full compliance.
C.
The Board or its agents and employees may from time to time request
and receive information and material from the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts Department of Agriculture describing normal, generally
accepted framing practices for handling equine waste.

anticipated or new information requires additional consultant services.
Failure by the applicant to pay the consultant fee specified by the
Board within 10 business days of the request for payment shall be
cause for the Board to determine the application is administratively
incomplete. The Board shall state such in a letter to the applicant. No
additional review or action shall be taken on the permit request until
the applicant has paid the requested fee. Failure by the applicant to pay
the consultant fee specified by the Board within 10 business days of the
request for payment shall be cause for the Board to deny the permit
application.
The applicant may appeal the selection of the outside consultant to the
Barnstable Town Council, which may disqualify the outside consultant
selected only on the grounds that the consultant has a conflict of
interest or does not possess the minimum required qualifications. The
minimum qualifications shall consist of either an educational degree or
three or more years of practice in the field at issue or related field.
Such an appeal must be in writing and received by the Town Council
and a copy received by the Board of Health, so as to be received within
10 days of the date consultant fees were requested by the Board of
Health. The required time limits for action upon the application shall be
extended by the duration of the administrative appeal.

E.
F. Water quality.
§ 397-8 BARNSTABLE CODE § 397-8
397:898
Prior to approval of the well and approval of a disposal works
construction permit application, the owner or his agent shall take
a water sample(s) from the well and submit it to a state certified
testing laboratory for analysis, with the cost to be borne by the
owner. The results of all analyses shall be submitted to the Board
of Health. At a minimum, water must be tested for the following
chemical and bacteriological standards: total coliform, nitratenitrogen,
pH, conductivity, sodium, iron, and EPA methods 502.1/
503 or 502,2 or 524.1 or 524.2. These tests include analyses for
purgeable halocarbons and purgeable aromatics, as well as
analyses for petroleum hydrocarbons or pesticides.
(1)
The Board of Health will determine potability of the well water
using as guidelines the National Interim Primary and Secondary
Drinking Water Standards and the U.S. EPA Maximum Contaminant
Levels (MCLs). The water quality standards for common
parameters are as follows:
Primary Standards
Total coliform 0 colonies/100 ml MF
Nitrate 10 ppm
Secondary Standards
pH Recommend pH above 5.0
Sodium 20 ppm
Iron 0.3 ppm
(2)
When the Board of Health deems it necessary, the Health Agent or
other agent of the Board of Health may be present to witness the
taking of a water sample and/or may take the water sample and
deliver it to the testing laboratory him/herself.
(3)
The Board of Health further recommends that all well owners have
their wells tested at a minimum of every two years, and at more
frequent intervals when water quality problems are known to exist.
(4)
Well yield and water system design.
Before approval, every well shall be pump tested to determine
yield. The pump test shall include a drawdown test at a minimum
pumping rate of five gallons per minute for one hour.
(1)
The design of the water system, including well, pump, storage
tank, and other accessories must be adequate to provide a water
capacity in gallons per minute which equals the number of water
fixtures installed; in addition, capacity (in gpm) must not be less
than the peak demand for the largest fixture installed. For the
purposes of this regulation a fixture is defined as a water outlet,
and includes faucets, sinks, toilets, bathtubs, washing machines,
dishwashers, and the like.
(2)
G.
§ 397-8 WELLS § 397-8
397:899
In areas where salt water or other pollutant intrusion exists or
is believed likely, and where the Board of Health (in conjunction
with a designing engineer, as outlined under well construction) has
determined a well pumping rate which must be used to prevent
further contamination, the Board of Health may specify design
criteria for the building and water system served by the well, so
that the water storage tank, number of fixtures and habitable space
are compatible with the pumping capacity of the well.
(3)
Submission of well water test results.
Prior to issuance of a certificate of approval for a well intended
for human consumption, the results of all water quality and yield
tests shall be submitted to the Board of Health. The owner of the
property which the well will serve, or the well driller acting as
agent for the owner, shall certify, on a form provided by the Board
of Health, the following:
The location, and date the sample was taken, and the
laboratory at which it was analyzed;
(a)
That the water sample whose analysis results were submitted
to the Board of Health was taken from the well for which
approval is being sought; and
(b)
(c) The results of the yield test performed by the well driller.
(1)
H.
Well approval.
New wells shall not be placed into use for human consumption until
the Board of Health has approved the potability and quantity of the
water provided and issued a certificate of approval for the well to
the owner of the property which the well serves.
(1)
A certificate of approval for a well will not be issued until:
The well water has been shown to meet the water quality
criteria outlined in the regulations; and
(a)
The capacity of the water system, in gallons per minute, has
been demonstrated to equal the number of fixtures installed.
(b)
(2)
In addition, for wells installed at newly constructed buildings, the
Board of Health shall require that a certified plot plan, drawn by a
registered land surveyor or registered professional civil engineer,
be submitted to the Board of Health. Such plot plan must show the
actual location of the well on the lot as cross tie distances from
lot corners, and must show the location of the septic system, as
installed, in relation to the well. The plot plan must also identify, by
Assessor's map, parcel and lot number, the property on which the
well is located. This information may be included in the certified
plot plan required by the Building Commissioner which shows the
location of the foundation on the lot. 107

§ 401-15. Media and public relations procedures.
Productive and effective media relations are developed through fair, ethical,
truthful and systematically implemented media management systems.
Certain basic elements of a media management system include conduct
with media, goal setting, marketing, staff training, evaluation of
relationship, review of story, assignment of staff responsibility.
Conduct.
Be yourself: The most important element is to be yourself. Cameras
and reporters are like truth serums, they can tell when you are not
truthful. Avoid technical jargon or fancy, pretentious language, it
does not impress anyone and may confuse them.
(1)
Be comfortable and confident: Relax; remember that your
knowledge of the story is why you are being interviewed. Take
control; say what you want to say, not what someone wants you to
say. Do not jump or react to a story or a question.
(2)
Be honest: If you do not know the answer to a question, admit it.
Do not lie to a reporter. Your credibility is crucial, never jeopardize
it.
(3)
Be brief: Short, clear answers are most effective in communicating
an idea on television or radio. Get right to the point. Simple talk is
less prone to being quoted out of context.
(4)
A.
§ 401-11 WELLS § 401-15
397:911
Use of humor: Used properly, it can promote a friendly and
confident image.
(5)
Be personal: Personal stories and anecdotes can help get across an
idea or concept, and are better remembered.
(6)
Be positive and consistent: Keep your goals in mind and stick to
them. Approach each question in a positive way.
(7)
Concentrate: Put your full attention on the interviewer. Look
directly at the person asking the question. Do not become
distracted by outside interference. Listen carefully to questions
asked; if unclear, ask that it be restated.
(8)
Show energy: Be animated; use gestures, facial expressions, body
language to add vitality to your response. Keep a conversational
voice, but remember that it has a "face" which can show different
emotions and expressions. Lean forward and be alert. An effective
interview is hard, physical work.
(9)
Show sincerity and concern: In any interview it is important. Be
careful; consider your message; don't be afraid to pause. Avoid
stating "no comment." It can be detrimental to your image or the
public's understanding of your situation. Every time you speak,
look and sound as if you mean it. Speak convincingly, saying what
you mean and meaning what you say.
(10)
Goal setting.
Mass media communications mailing list: available in office of Town
Manager; also available on Information Systems FAX machine; to
be utilized in notifying media of information.
(1)
Media is important: The Town represents the public through the
media. Public issues discussed shall include the media, in order
that the public can be informed of administrative and legislative
discussions and decisions.
(2)
B.
Marketing.
Standard press release: Utilize format enclosed. It should be
disseminated one week prior to event, or publication need, at
earliest convenience.

on fiscal policy and other related concerns such as debt and
investment management.
Power to adopt operational procedures. Consistent with the
provisions of this policy, the Finance Director may adopt
operational procedures governing the internal functions of the
Finance Department.
(2)
Service area. The Finance Director shall oversee a consolidated
financial operation that includes the Barnstable Public Schools as
approved by the School Committee and Town Council
(3)
Delegation of authority. The Director of Finance may delegate authority
to designees as he or she sees fit.
C.
Short-term forecasts. The Finance Department shall use short-range
forecasts (up to one year) to principally prepare the annual budget and
to project cash flow.
A.
Long-term forecasts. Consistent with the Town Charter, the Finance
Department shall annually prepare and recommend to the Town
Manager a ten-year financial forecast of Town revenue, expenditures,
and general financial condition of the Town. The long-term forecast
shall also include:
(1) Identification of factors which impact financial condition;
(2) Revenue and expenditure trends;
(3) Potential sources of new or expanded revenue; and
(4) Actions necessary to enhance the financial condition of the Town.
B.
Operating budget. The operating budget serves the role of harnessing
financial and organizational resources of the Town in order to attain its
goals and objectives. The operating budget may consist of the following
funds (Their definitions are included in the accounting section below.):
(1) The general fund.
(2) Special revenue funds.
(3) Special assessment funds.
(4) Capital project funds.
(5) Enterprise funds.
(6) Fiduciary funds.
C.
Budget cycle. The budget cycle for a fiscal year shall have four phases
and operate as follows:
D.
§ 401-26 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-27
397:920
(1) Preparation of estimated expenditures and projected revenues;
(2) Adoption;
(3) Implementation or execution throughout the fiscal year; and
Evaluation and assessment of attainment of goals and objectives
and performance which includes monthly reports to the Town
Manager and quarterly reports to the Town Council.
(4)
Budget approaches. Several approaches may be used in the operating
budget. Their usefulness varies dependent on the goals to be achieved.
These approaches consist of line-item, programmatic, performance,
total quality management, and zero-based budgeting (ZBB). It is the
current policy of the Town Manager to use the programmatic budget
format.
E.
Capital budgeting. A "capital expenditure" is defined as an outlay for
the construction or purchase of a facility that is expected to provide
services over a considerable period of time. Capital expenditures
usually are large compared with expenditures for items in the operating
budget. The Capital Improvements Plan (CIP) and the Capital
Improvements Budget should be developed through the following steps:
selection of projects, forecasting of resources, and determining the
financing method.
Determining worthwhile projects. A public investment is desirable
when the present value of its estimated flow of benefits, discounted
at the community's cost of capital, exceeds or equals its cost. A
public investment is also desirable when the project rates highly
with community values. The latter criteria may include, but not
limited to:
(a) Preservation of capital;
(b) Legal conformance;
(c) Town goals and objectives;
(d) Health, safety, general welfare;
(e) Cost effectiveness;
(f) Environmental quality;
(g) Quality of life;
(h) Economic development;
(i) Financial leverage; and
(j) Special needs of the community.
(1)
Forecasting fiscal resources. These resources should be projected
in terms of normally anticipated sources of revenues, normal
(2)
F.
§ 401-27 WELLS § 401-27
397:921
§ 401-28. Accounting, reporting and auditing.
These policies and procedures are based on the premise that good
accounting provides timely information as to when expenses will exceed
budget plans, when capital funds are diverted to operations, when
expenditures are outpacing revenues, and when the local government is
incurring financial obligations beyond its fiscal capacity.
expenditures, and existing debt service obligations. Future
revenues may be projected by studying past data on existing
revenue sources. Projections should be based on existing tax rates
and applied to a forecast of the growth of the existing tax base.
As with expenditure trends, questions should be posed about
significant deviations from past trends to learn whether special
factors are likely to affect expenditure patterns in the future. Then,
the capital improvements budget should be formulated by detailing
the costs of the selected projects for the next five years, and should
be summarized in a table including the following:
(a) A complete list of major capital improvements;
(b) Estimates of the total cost of each improvement;
Outside sources of financing, such as state or federal grants
and private gifts; and
(c)
(d) The scheduling of construction starts and annual expenditures.
Determine financing method. The next step in capital budget
preparation is to develop a financial plan and its effects on the
tax structure. The plan should outline financing needs and
recommended sources (e.g., bonding, fees, grants, etc.)
(3)
Accounting standards. Standards for accounting are guided by GAAP
and are described by a subcommittee of the FASB as follows: Generally
accepted accounting principles are primarily conventional in nature.
They are the result of decisions; they represent the consensus at any
time as to how the financial accounting process should operate and
how financial statements should be prepared from the information
made available through the financial accounting process. Inasmuch as
generally accepted accounting principles embody a consensus, they
depend heavily on notions such as "general acceptance" and
"substantial authoritative support," which have not been and probably
cannot be precisely defined. There is concurrence, however, that the
notions of "general acceptance" and "substantial authoritative support"
relate to the propriety of practices, as viewed by informed, intelligent,
and experienced accountants in the light of the purposes and
limitations of financial accounting process.
A.
Fund basis of accounting. The various types of funds for accounting are
as follows:
B.
§ 401-27 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-28
397:922
General fund: for resources not devoted to specific activities and
finances many of the basic municipal functions;
(1)
Special revenue funds: account for the receipts from revenue
sources that have been earmarked for specific activities;
(2)
Special assessment fund: financing and construction of public
improvements that benefit a specific group of properties;
(3)
(4) Enterprise fund: business-type activities supported by user fees;
Internal service funds: similar to enterprise funds, but the services
are rendered to other departments within the Town; and
(5)
Trust and agency funds: assets held for others or nontax resources
under trust instructions.
(6)
Encumbrance accounting. This accounting technique shall be used with
the purpose of ensuring conformance with budget specifications.
The steps for encumbrance accounting as part of the Town's
purchase order system are:
Submission of a purchase order by the requesting department;
all information must be completed by the requesting
department.
(a)
Purchase order signed by the appropriate department
manager.
(b)
Verification of funds availability by the Town Accountant's
office.
(c)
Entry of data into the accounting system by the Town
Accountant's office staff; funds are encumbered at this point.
(d)
(1)
These first four steps open an account for future purchases; actual
purchases are made through requisitions from the requesting
department or invoices from vendors, which will draw down on the
account opened by the purchase order.
(2)
C.
Financial reporting. This activity shall consist of three types:
General purpose financial statements that provide an overview
of the financial position and the results of operations of all fund
types (Reporting format should be similar to that of budget and
conducted on a monthly basis.);
(1)
Comprehensive annual financial reports that contain the general
purpose financial statements, an introductory section,
management's discussion and analysis, supporting statements, and
a statistical section; and
(2)
D.
§ 401-28 WELLS § 401-28
397:923
§ 401-29. Property tax administration.
Annual audit report as described in Subsection D(2) above.
It shall also contain the significant accounting policies of the
Town summarized as "notes to financial statements," statistical
information; current liabilities; and the arbitrage rebate
amount due to the federal government.
(a)
Annual long-term debt report (ALTDR), which shall contain
specific details of all long-term debt of the Town, including
refunding. The ALTDR shall include, but not be limited to, a
schedule of changes in bonds, notes and loans payable; annual
principal and interest payments due until maturity; total debt
outstanding by purpose; annual charter bond limitations and
issues; debt issue call provisions; and the legal debt margin.
(b)
Annual fiscal indicators and financial forecast (See § 401-27B.),
which should summarize the Town's financial condition by
describing the necessary economic indicators, financial trends
and credit ratios for the past 12 months. The information for
this section should include, but not be limited to, assessed
value of real property; ratio of net bonded debt to assessed
value; net bonded debt per capita; bond coverage ratios
current fund balance; ratio of annual debt service expenditures
to general government expenditures; per capita income;
population; revenue and expenditures trends; rapidity of
principal repayment; and other financial and economic graphs
and narrative.
(c)
The Capital Improvements Plan (CIP) as described in
§ 401-27F. The current version of the CIP should be included
in the AFIR.
(d)
Objectives. Administration of the property tax shall have the following
objectives:
Fairness. A tax should reflect the ability to pay of those who bear
its burden, or the tax burden should be matched by the benefits
taxpayers receive.
(1)
Certainty. The rules of taxation should be clearly stated and evenly
applied (i.e., reflect market value without bias).
(2)
(3) Convenience. The tax should be convenient to pay.
Efficiency. Administration and collection costs should not be out of
proportion to the revenues, and the tax should be neither easy to
avoid nor too costly to enforce.
(4)
(5) Productivity. A tax should produce sufficient, stable revenue.
A.
§ 401-28 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-29
397:924
§ 401-30. User fees and special districts.
User fees and special assessment districts shall be designed to relieve
burdens on the general revenue system by extracting greater contributions
from service beneficiaries by resembling an enterprise pricing system. User
fees and special districts shall be based on several principles which include:
Neutrality. A tax should not distort the way a community would
ordinarily use its resources unless it is overtly desired.
(6)
Administration. Fundamental to the task of property tax administration
is the establishment of a highly qualified staff and organization and
efficient systems. The property tax administration process should
consist of the following steps:
(1) Discovery;
(2) Inventory;
(3) Appraisal and assessment;
(4) Periodic assessment;
(5) Evaluating the assessment; and
(6) Applying exemptions where allowable.
B.
Determining the levy. This step is conducted by subtracting the
forecasted amounts of local revenues (sources other than the property
tax) from the total estimated expenditures. The property tax rate is then
obtained by dividing the required levy by the total value of property
assessments and adjusting for anticipated delinquencies and estimated
tax collections from past delinquencies. The resulting tax rate is
expressed in mills per dollar (tax dollars per thousand dollars) of
assessed value.
C.
Collection. Tax collections may be performed through quarterly
installments. The Tax Collection Office shall also levy penalties and
interest charges for late payments.
D.
Total costs. These costs include direct costs (personnel and benefits,
expenses) and indirect costs (general administration and facility costs).
A.
Comparability. Prices for services should be competitive and/or
consistent with the market for the particular service.
B.
Consistency with community priorities. Prices for services should
reflect the priorities of the Town of Barnstable.
C.
Conscientious subsidy policy. Subsidies should be established in an
overt manner and directed only to the targeted services or users.
D.
Periodic review. A periodic review shall be conducted in order to assess
whether user fees are in line with adopted policy.

Debt management. The Town faces continuing capital infrastructure
requirements to meet the increasing needs of its citizens and visitors.
The purpose of this policy is to provide a functional tool for debt
management and capital planning, as well as to enhance the Town's
reputation for managing its debt in a conservative fashion. In the
following section, the Town shall pursue the following goals:
The Town shall endeavor to attain the highest possible credit rating
for each debt issue.
(1)
The Town shall take all practical precautions to avoid any financial
decision which will negatively impact current credit ratings on
existing or future debt issues.
(2)

112. Editor's Note: The Hyannis water rates are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 401-30.1 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-31
397:926
Effectively utilize debt capacity in relation to Town growth and tax
burden to meet long-term capital requirements.
(3)
When planning for issuance of new debt, the Town shall consider
the impact of such new debt on overlapping debt and the financing
plans of taxing entities which overlap, or underlie, the Town.
(4)
When issuing debt, the Town shall assess financial alternatives
to include new and innovative financing approaches, including
whenever feasible, categorical grants, revolving loans or other
state/federal aid.
(5)
(6) Minimize debt interest costs.
The Town's financial management policies shall seek to improve the
overall well-being of the citizens, maintain and improve essential
municipal services, and enhance the financial capability of the
Town.
(7)
Debt issuance in general. The laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts authorize the issuance of debt by the Town Treasurer.
The law (MGL c. 44, §§ 1 through 28C) confers upon municipalities
the power and authority to contract debt, borrow money, and issue
bonds for public improvement projects as defined therein. Under these
provisions, the Town may contract debt to pay for the cost of acquiring,
constructing, reconstructing, improving, extending, enlarging, and
equipping such projects or to refund bonds. The Town Charter
authorizes the Town Council to establish by ordinance reasonable
standards relating to the management of financial systems and
practices.
B.
Financing strategy. A financing strategy shall be adopted and
periodically reviewed for appropriateness given the economic and fiscal
environments. These strategies may consist of:
Pay-as-you-go. This includes expenditures, typically out of
operating expenditures, made over a short period of time, even for
benefits that may accrue over a longer period.
(1)
Pay-as-you-use. This strategy allows payment over a period of time
that is approximately the same as the benefits. This strategy may
include bonding which should proceed with the following steps:
Obtain legal opinion in order to see if statutory permission
exists to borrow for the intended purpose.
(a)
(b) Determine the cost of the intended project.
(2)
Bond issuance.
Determine the type and amount of bonds to be issued, period of
time for maturity, and intention to sell or float the bonds. This
analysis should include:
(a)
(3)
C.
§ 401-31 WELLS § 401-31
397:927
[1] Economic factors;
[2] Financial factors;
[3] Debt factors;
[4] Project risk;
[5] Management risk; and
[6] Structuring risk.
Insurance should be obtained in order that in the event of
a default by the issuer, the insurance company pays the
investors.
(b)
About one month before the scheduled sale of the bonds, the
issuer should publish a prospectus describing the provisions
of the bond issue and providing information that will permit
investors to price the bonds properly.
(c)
Determine the role of an underwriter, either through a
competitive sale or negotiated sale. Awards made with a
competitive sale should be consistent with the process outlined
in the Town's Procurement Policy.113
(d)
Types of debt issued.
Short-term. The Town may issue short-term debt which would
include grant anticipation notes, tax anticipation notes, special
assessment anticipation notes and bond anticipation notes. Such
instruments will allow the Town to meet its cash flow requirements
or provide increased flexibility in its financing programs.
(1)
Long-term. The Town may only issue long-term debt general
obligation bonds. The Town may also enter into long-term leases for
public facilities, property, and equipment with a useful life greater
than five years.
(2)
Variable rate. The Town may issue debt that has variable interest
rates in order to achieve interest savings. Periodically, the Director
of Finance and Treasurer shall analyze each outstanding variable
rate issue to determine if the issue should be converted to fixed
rate debt.
(3)
D.
Capital Improvements Plan. The Capital Improvements Plan (CIP),
prepared by the Town Manager and reviewed by the Comprehensive
Finance Advisory Committee (CFAC), shall determine the Town's capital
needs. The program shall be a five-year plan for acquisition,
development and/or improvement of the Town's facilities. Projects
included in the CIP shall be prioritized, and the means for financing

debt.
each shall be identified. The first year of the program shall be the
Capital Budget, which shall become the basis for debt issuance. The
CIP shall be revised and supplemented each year keeping with the
Town's stated policies on debt management. The planning aspects of
CIP development are found in § 401-27F, Capital budgeting.
Useful life. The CIP shall specify the period of usefulness for each
project or capital asset to be acquired, built, and/or improved, and
financed with bonds or other debt securities. The useful or reasonable
life shall be computed from the anticipated date of the bonds, and
this period shall not exceed the guidelines specified by state law. The
Town shall not authorize the issuance of bonds or other long-term debt
obligations for any improvements or capital purpose with a useful life
of less than five years.
F.
Structure of debt issues. The duration of a debt issue shall not exceed
the economic or useful life of the improvement or asset that the issue is
financing. The Town shall design the financing schedule and repayment
of debt so as to take best advantage of market conditions and, as
practical, to recapture or maximize its credit capacity for future use.
In keeping with the stated goals of this debt management policy, the
Town shall structure each general obligation issue (except refunding
and minibond issues) to comply with the rapidity of debt repayment
provisions in § 401-32F following.
G.
Sale of securities. All debt issues shall be sold through a competitive
bidding process based upon the lowest offered net interest cost (NIC),
unless the Treasurer deems a negotiated sale the most advantageous to
the Town.
H.
Markets. The Town shall make use of both domestic and international
capital markets as the products and conditions of each best fits the
Town's financing needs. When practical in its financing program, the
Town shall consider local or regional markets.
I.
Credit enhancements. The Town may enter into agreements with
commercial banks or other financial entities for the purpose of
acquiring letters of credit, municipal bond insurance, or other credit
enhancements that will provide the Town with access to credit under
terms and conditions as specified in such agreements when their use is
judged cost effective or otherwise advantageous.
J.
State law: General Laws of Massachusetts, Chapter 44, Sections 1
through 28C et seq. The short title is "Municipal Finance."
A.
Authority for debt. The Town may incur indebtedness or borrow money,
and authorize the issuance of negotiable obligations, including
B.
§ 401-31 WELLS § 401-32
397:929
refunding bonds, for any capital improvement or property, or any other
lawful purpose except current expenses and permanent obligation.
Debt limitation. No bond issue shall be authorized that will cause
the percentage of indebtedness to exceed 2 1/2% of the equalized
valuation. The Town may authorize indebtedness in excess of 2 1/2%,
but not in excess of 5% of the equalized valuation, provided that the
Town gains approval from the Municipal Finance Oversight Board,
which approval may be given either before or after such authorization.
All authorized debts, except those expressly authorized by law to be
incurred outside the debt limit, shall be considered in determining the
limit of indebtedness under this section.
C.
Certification. An annual debt statement shall be filed with the Director
of Accounts in the Department of Revenue. The annual debt statement
certifies the amount of gross debt, deductions from gross debt, net
debt, equalized valuation and net debt expressed as a percentage of the
equalized valuation as of the end of the previous fiscal year.
D.
Debt issued to finance operating costs. The Town shall not finance
general operating costs as a portion of a debt issue having maturities
greater than one year. General operating costs include, but may not be
limited to, those items normally funded in the Town's annual operating
budget and having a useful life of less than one year.
E.
Credit implications. Each annual version of the CIP shall be included
in an annual fiscal indicators report (AFIR) that computes the absolute
amounts of key economic indicators and the year-to-year trends for
important financial ratios, including Moody's Selected Indicators of
Municipal Performance ("medians") or other recognized industry
standards. When issuing new debt, the Town should endeavor to neither
cause a major deterioration in these key financial trends nor exceed
credit industry benchmarks where applicable. Therefore, the following
factors should be considered in developing debt issuance plans:
Ratio of net bonded debt to estimated full value. The formula for
this computation is net bonded debt, which is the total outstanding
debt divided by the current estimated full value as determined by
the Director of Accounts in the State Department of Revenue.
(1)
Net bonded debt per capita. The formula for this computation is
net bonded debt divided by the current population as determined
by the Director of Planning.
(2)
Ratio of net bonded debt to equalized value. The formula for this
computation is net bonded debt, which is the total outstanding
debt divided by the current assessed value as determined by the
Directing of Assessing.
(3)
Ratio of annual debt service to general government expenditures.
The formula for this computation is annual debt service

expenditures divided by general government (i.e., general and
special revenue funds) expenditures.
Rapidity of debt service repayment. Exclusive of refunding and
minibond issues, the Town's general obligation general
improvement bond issues shall be structured whereby at least 25%
of the principal and interest for each issue is repaid in five years
and 50% in 10 years.
(5)
General fund balance. The Town shall maintain a minimum general
fund budgetary fund balance (free cash) equal to 4% of total annual
appropriations, exclusive of inter-fund transfers.
(6)
Coverage ratios. The Town shall maintain legal and adequate debt
service coverage ratios for any double-barreled bonds in each
applicable fiscal year. The maintenance of the coverage ratios shall
be consistent with preserving the credit rating for each particular
issue while conducting ongoing cost of service studies to determine
adequate user rate charges.
(7)
Financial disclosures. The Town shall prepare appropriate disclosures
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal government,
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, rating agencies, underwriters,
investors, agencies, taxpayers, and other appropriate entities and
persons to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and
Table III herein (Credit implications).114 These disclosures shall be
reported in appropriate financial documents as enumerated in
Appendices B and C.115
A.
Review of financing proposals. All capital financing proposals involving
a pledge of the Town's credit through the sale of securities, execution
of loans or lease agreements or otherwise involving directly the lending
or pledging of the Town's credit shall be referred to the Director of
Finance who shall determine the financial feasibility of such proposal
and make recommendations accordingly to the Town Manager.
B.
Establishing financing priorities. The Directors of Finance and Treasury
shall administer and coordinate the Town's debt issuance program and
activities, including timing of issuance, method of sale, structuring the
issue, and marketing strategies. The Directors of Finance and Treasury
along with the Town's financial advisor shall meet, as appropriate, with
the Town Manager regarding the status of the current year's program
and to make specific recommendations.
C.
Rating agency relations. The Town shall endeavor to maintain effective
relations with the rating agencies. The Director of Finance and

appropriate financial information.
Investment community relations. The Town shall endeavor to maintain
a positive relationship with the investment community. The Director
of Finance and Treasurer, and the Town's financial advisor shall, as
necessary, prepare reports and other forms of communications
regarding the Town's indebtedness, as well as its future financing plans.
This includes information presented to the press and other media.
E.
Refunding policy. The Town shall consider refunding outstanding debt
when legally permissible and financially advantageous. A net present
value debt service savings of at least 3% or greater must be achieved.
As required by law, the refunding plan will be submitted to the Director
of Accounts in the Department of Revenue for its positive findings.
F.
Investment of borrowed proceeds. The Town acknowledges its ongoing
fiduciary responsibilities to actively manage the proceeds of debt issued
for public purposes in a manner that is consistent with Massachusetts
statutes governing the investment of public funds and with the
permitted securities covenants of related bond documents executed by
the Town. The management of public funds shall enable the Town to
respond to changes in markets or changes in payment or construction
schedules so as to optimize returns, insure liquidity, and minimize risk.
G.
Federal arbitrage rebate requirement. The Town shall maintain or
cause to be maintained an appropriate system of accounting to
calculate bond investment arbitrage earnings in accordance with the
Tax Reform Act of 1986, as amended or supplemented, and applicable
United States Treasury regulations related thereto. Such amounts shall
be computed annually and transferred from the general fund (interest
earnings revenue account) to a federal arbitrage rebate agency fund, or
other appropriate account, for eventual payment to the United States
Treasury.

A self-insurance reserve fund will be established and maintained to
cover workers' compensation as authorized by Chapter 40, § 13A, of
the Massachusetts General Laws and property losses as authorized by
Chapter 40, § 13, of the Massachusetts General Laws.
A.
In order to cover losses arising out this fund, an amount will be
appropriated to cover the stop-loss premium and a sum to establish the
fund for future losses.

A.
In addition, accordingly, § 401-27F, Capital budgeting, of this document
states that the Capital Improvements Plan (CIP) and the Capital
Improvements Budget are developed through the following steps:
selection of projects, forecasting of resources, and determining the
financing method.
B.
Irrespective of the perceived potential for funding, it is most important
that all known capital requirements over the five-year plan period be
included in any submittals. Unless all needs are identified, the value of
the plan will be seriously diminished. Furthermore, it is essential that
the Town Manager, Town Council and the public be kept informed of all
of the Town's capital needs.
A.
Existing capital projects review. Department heads shall review all
previously authorized capital projects for which there is an existing
available balance for the purpose of validating their continued need.
To assist in this review, a schedule of capital appropriations requiring
reauthorization will be prepared by the Finance Division.
Unencumbered balances for all capital projects authorized more than
two years prior shall be terminated effective at the end of this fiscal
year. Where a justifiable need for these projects continues, they should
be included in the current submission for reauthorization by the Town
Council.
B.
New projects. All projects must be documented using the Capital
Project Data Sheet. This documentation must include a detailed Project
Description, a well-thought-out project justification, defined impact of
denial/postponement, time and cost estimates, including current year
and subsequent years if multiyear, identification of the source of

funding, definition of operating budget impact (costs and expected
savings must be explained), and any supplemental information for
clarification. Each project must be assigned a department/division
priority and must be signed by the department or division manager.
Prioritization of projects must be consistent with the Town Council's
current strategic plan. A summary listing of all capital projects
submitted will be prepared by the Finance Division in a spread sheet
format for distribution/viewing by the appropriate reviewers.
Definitions for capital project eligibility.
Major capital project: a capital project that has a total cost of
$250,000 or more and an expected service life of five years or
longer will normally be funded from the Capital Trust Fund as
a borrowing authorization. The only exception to the foregoing
threshold are projects dealing with roads that, subject to funding
availability, will normally be funded from cash reserves. In some
instances, where the cost is beyond the capacity of the Capital
Trust Fund (e.g., new building, etc), the project will be considered
for bonding by debt exclusion or financed by another identified
source of funds.
(1)
Capital/maintenance project: Repair or replacement of existing
buildings or equipment, construction of new buildings, land
acquisitions, any nonrecurring capital expenditure, or other capital
purchase that costs $50,000 or more and has a life expectancy
greater than three years. Except in special cases (e.g.
reauthorization of a previously approved project, increase to a
previously authorized project, etc.), projects or items estimated
to cost less than the $50,000 will only be considered within the
operating budget under operating capital. These project will be
funded from cash reserves within the Capital Trust Fund.
(2)
D.
Review teams. A Town CIP Task Force consisting of 10 members will
evaluate each of the projects. The task force shall be comprised of the
department managers of the Airport, Community Services, Planning
and Development, Police, Public Works, Regulatory Services, Finance,
and Information Systems Departments, the Assistant Director of the
Department of Public Works and a senior manager of the School
Department. In addition, a CFAC subcommittee consisting of no fewer
than three members of CFAC will also evaluate each submitted project.
Standard forms for evaluation and scoring shall be forwarded to the
evaluators at the time the capital project data sheets for all of the
projects are distributed. All projects must be scored regardless of
the year they are to be funded. [Amended 5-4-2017 by Order No.
2017-142]

Evaluation criteria. The evaluation criteria shall be consistent with
identified strategic plan areas and shall, at a minimum, include impact

infrastructure and protection of capital assets, environment and natural
resources, quality of life, financing, operating cost, planning and
relationship to existing plans, and usage and service demand.
Evaluation approach. The impact of each project on the criteria
elements shall be ranked on a scale of 0 (no impact) to 4 (highest
impact) independently by each evaluator. The results will be
consolidated for each team (Town Task Force and CFAC) by developing
an average score for each criteria element for each project and an
overall total score for each project. The results of the ranking will be
provided to the Town Manager for his consideration in preparing the
Capital Improvements Plan. The CFAC rankings will also be included in
the final CFAC CIP report prepared for the Town Manager and the Town
Council.

Insurance Policies and Procedures
[Amended 12-7-2010]
§ 401-45. Authority.
§ 401-46. Delegation of authority.
The Town Manager has assigned the Finance Director as the person
responsible for coordination of the Town's insurance. The Finance Director
shall be responsible for ensuring that the Town Attorney is apprised of
legal issues pertaining to litigation representation and control, pursuant
to applicable Town ordinances. The Town Manager reserves the right to
modify and amend the procedure and policy outlined, as necessitated by
coverage changes. It is intended to promulgate annual updates to this
policy.
§ 401-47. Procedure for processing self-insurance payments.
Any transaction involving the purchase, sale or transfer of any Townowned
real or personal property, whether vehicles, buildings, land,
equipment, etc., must be forwarded to the Finance Director in order to
determine the requirements of insurance.
A.
When a contract contains an insurance requirement, that portion of
the contract must be submitted to the Finance Director and the Town
Attorney for review and approval of coverages.
B.
When a department engages a vendor and requires insurance coverage,
the limits should meet those minimally set forth in the Town's
coverages. No direct transactions are to be conducted by department
personnel with the insurance broker or the insurance company. All
transactions shall be directed through the Finance Director or his or
her designee.
C.
D. If there are questions, they should be directed to the Finance Director.
Purpose: to establish the criteria for the payment of losses under the
Town self-insurance program, effective June 30, 1993.
A.
Applicability. This program applies to property, physical damage,
automobile and general liability claims for damages within the Town of
Barnstable. The claims for damages under the Town's property policy
will be made from the Municipal Building Insurance Fund in
accordance with Town ordinance and MGL c. 40, § 13. The claims for
damages under the Town's automobile and general liability policies will
be made in accordance with the procedure specified below.
B.
Rationale. The Town cannot continue to rely upon the insurance
industry to stabilize the increase in insurance premiums. The coverage
obtained will vary from areas previously covered. Policy deductibles
C.
§ 401-45 WELLS § 401-47
397:939
are introduced where previously the Town enjoyed no deductible or
a small deductible. It is therefore adopted as policy by the Town of
Barnstable, to instruct departments subject to these policies in the
following manner.
Procedure. In general, the following procedures apply. Specific
exceptions may be found under the description of each major insurance
policy.
To apply for reimbursement under this program, the department
manager or claimant must submit the claim for alleged damages
to the Finance Director as soon as possible from its known
occurrence, in writing. Failure to make such notification may result
in its denial.
(1)
Initial report of a potential claim should be made by telephone and
followed up by a written report to the Finance Director.
(2)
The claim notice, if the standard ACORD form is not used, should
provide information relative to: nature of claim; date of accident/
loss, time of same; location (specific) of claim; name, address,
phone number of person making claim; full description of accident
or loss; estimate of dollar loss on claim; names, addresses, phone
numbers of witnesses; relationship to Town of Barnstable (insured
party).
(3)
Estimates of damages alleged should be developed by the
department manager/claimant, and submitted to the Finance
Director as soon as possible.
(4)
Deductibles for policies will vary; consult with the Finance Director
for current deductibles in the following policies:
(a) Automobile.
(b) Property.
(c) Building and contents.
(d) Fine arts.
(e) Portable radios.
(f) Contractor equipment.
(g) Flood and earthquake.
(h) General liability.
(i) Boiler and machinery.
(5)
It is the policy of the Town that losses for various coverages apply
as follows:
(6)
D.
§ 401-47 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-47
397:940
§ 401-48. Workers' compensation.
Automobile: Losses up to $499 payable by department
incurring loss; balance through the Auto Insurance Account, if
funds are available.
(a)
Property: Losses up to $999 payable by department; losses
from $1,000 to policy deductible processed through the
Municipal Building Insurance Fund.
(b)

department; losses from $1,000 to policy deductible processed
through the Municipal Building Insurance Fund.
(c)
Fine arts: Losses up to $250 payable by department; losses
above deductible processed through the Municipal Building
Insurance Fund.

balance through boiler and machinery policy.
(h)
In regard to notices of loss for property: in excess of $1,000 up
to deductible, general liability under $1,000; the Town may elect
to use the services of an insurance appraisal firm. These will be
utilized on a per-occurrence basis. Since a fee is charged for these
services, the Town will be selective in using same.
(7)
Upon approval of claim, the department manager/claimant will be
notified and payment processed.
(8)
The use of a release for claims made paid for amounts under
appropriate deductible will establish relinquishment of Town to
make any additional payments after receiving any additional claims
for damages. This will establish a payment without prejudice
provision and be enforced by the Town Attorney.
(9)
A. The claimant reports the accident to his/her supervisor.
The supervisor completes the first report of the accident, supervisor's
report of injury, and medical authorization form, within 48 hours of
notification. The supervisor submits the completed form to the workers'
compensation agent in the Personnel Department. If the claimant is to

ARTICLE VII
Investment Procedures
[Amended 12-7-2010]
§ 401-53. General policy and objectives.
§ 401-54. Investment instruments.
It is the policy of the Town of Barnstable that, giving due regard to
the safety and risk of investment, all available funds shall be invested
in conformance with legal and administrative guidelines and maximize
yields with the minimum of risk and utilization of collateralization when
requested.
A.
Effective cash management is recognized as essential to good fiscal
management. An aggressive cash management and investment policy
will be pursued to take advantage of investment interest as a viable
revenue source. The Town's portfolio shall be designed and managed in
a manner responsive to the public trust and consistent with state and
local law. Investments shall be made with the primary objectives of:
(1) Preservation of capital;
(2) Maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet operating needs;
(3) Security of Town funds and investments;
Diversification of investments to avoid unreasonable or avoidable
risks; and
(4)
(5) Maximization of return on the portfolio.
B.
Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 44, Section 55B, requires the
municipal treasurer to invest all public funds except those required
to be kept uninvested for purposes of immediate distribution. The
state law further requires that invested funds are to be placed at
the highest possible rate of interest reasonably available, taking into
account the acceptable levels of safety, liquidity and yield. Therefore,
these guidelines are intended to further the objective of securing the
highest reasonable return available that is consistent with safety of
principal while meeting the daily cash requirements for the operation
of the entity's business.
C.
Many public investments in Massachusetts are not protected by federal
or state law and many investments are uncollateralized. It is the policy
of the Town to retain the option to require full collateralization of
all Town investments other than obligations of the United States
government and its agencies. Certificates of deposit plus accrued
interest up to the amount covered by FDIC insurance do not need to be
collateralized pursuant to this policy. Collateralization should be held
by a third party where possible.
A.
§ 401-53 WELLS § 401-54
397:945
The Treasurer may invest in the following instruments:
The Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (MMDT), an
investment pool for state, local and other independent
governmental authorities, is under the auspices of the State
Treasurer and currently managed by Fidelity Investments. It
invests in bankers acceptances, commercial paper of high quality,
bank certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements and United
States Treasury Obligations.
(1)
United States Treasury notes and bonds: obligations of the United
States government issued with a fixed coupon rate and original
maturities.
(2)
United States agency obligations, provided that such United States
agency obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the
federal government.
(3)
Bank accounts or certificates of deposit which are fully
collateralized through a third party agreement.
(4)
Bank accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) insured by FDIC
up to the coverage limit, including CDAR eligible CDs. All bank
accounts and CDs in one institution are considered in the
aggregate for the insurance coverage limit. In some cases banking
institutions carry additional insurance, Depository Insurance Fund
(DIF).
(5)
Unsecured bank deposits of any kind such as other checking,
savings, money market or certificates of deposit accounts at banks
that do not fit the above categories. These investments are subject
to the following limitations: No more than 5% of an institution's
assets and no more than 25% of a municipality's cash may be
comprised of unsecured bank deposits. This percentage may be
increased for not more than 30 days during times of heavy
collection or in anticipation of large payments that will be made by
the Town in the near future. These payments may be for items such
as debt service payments, assessments or other large authorized
expenditures. The institution's creditworthiness will be tracked by
Veribanc, or other bank creditworthiness reporting systems. They
will be diversified as much as possible and consistent with this
policy.
(6)
Money market mutual funds that are registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and referenced in MGL c. 44, § 55.
(7)
Common and preferred stock that are listed in the List of Legal
Investments pursuant to MGL c. 167, § 15A, and MGL c. 167F, § 3.
(8)
Investment grade corporate bonds, with a minimum investment
risk rating of A/A2 Standard & Poor's/Moody's at the time of
purchase.
(9)
B.
§ 401-54 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-54
397:946
§ 401-55. Risk tolerance.
(10) Investment funds that are listed in the List of Legal Investments.
Mutual funds that are registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940.
(11)
All other items not separately identified here that are listed in the
List of Legal Investments.
(12)
Credit risk.
"Credit risk" is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an
investment will not fulfill its obligations.
(1)
There will be no limit to the amount of United States Treasury and
United States Government agency obligations, as they carry "AAA"
ratings.
(2)
In regards to other investments, the Town will only purchase
investment grade securities with a high concentration in securities
rated "A" or better.
(3)
A.
Custodial risk.
The "custodial credit risk" for deposits is the risk that, in the event
of the failure of a depository financial institution, a municipality
will not be able to recover deposits or will not be able to recover
collateral securities that are in possession of an outside party. The
custodial risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the
failure of the counterparty to a transaction, a municipality will not
be able to recover the value of investment or collateral securities
that are in the possession of an outside party. For securities not
covered by FDIC insurance, the institution should maintain
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) coverage and
sufficient additional insurance to cover the amount of the Town's
deposits with that institution.
(1)
The Town will review the financial institution's financial statements
and the background of the advisor. The institution should have
at least $100 million in asset management. The intent of this
qualification is to limit the Town's exposure to only those
institutions with a proven financial strength, capital adequacy of
the firm and overall affirmative reputation in the municipal
industry.
(2)
Further, all securities not held directly by the Town, will be held
in the Town's name and tax identification number by a third-party
custodian approved by the Treasurer and evidenced by safekeeping
receipts showing individual CUSIP numbers for each security.
(3)
B.
C. Concentration of credit risk.
§ 401-54 WELLS § 401-55
397:947
§ 401-56. Diversification.
"Concentration of credit risk" is the risk of loss attributed to the
magnitude of a government's investment in a single issuer.
(1)
The Town will minimize concentration of credit risk by diversifying
the investment portfolio so that the impact of potential losses from
any one type of security or issuer will be minimized. In terms of the
total amount of Town investments at any point in time, there shall
be 10% or less exposure for any one type of security or issuer with
the exception of instruments backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States Government or bank instruments or investment
vehicles fully insured by FDIC or DIF. For more specific information
relating to diversification percentages, refer to § 401-56, below.
(2)
Interest rate risk.
"Interest rate risk" is the risk that changes in interest rates will
adversely affect the fair value of an investment.
(1)
The Treasurer will manage interest rate risk by managing the
duration in the account. For general Town funds, the weighted
average days to maturity for the overall Town portfolio should be
365 days or less.
(2)
D.
Foreign currency risk. "Foreign currency risk" is the risk that changes
in foreign monetary exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value
of an investment or a deposit.
E.
Diversification should be interpreted in two ways: in terms of maturity
as well as instrument type and issuer. The diversification concept
should include prohibition against over-concentration of maturities,
as well as concentration in a specific issuer. With the exception of
United States Treasury obligations or investments fully collateralized
by United States Treasuries or agencies and state pools (MMDT), no
more than 10% of the Town's investments or an amount equal to the
maximum amount of FDIC and DIF insurance coverage, whichever is
greater, shall be invested in a single security issuer.
A.
In order to enhance total yield and fulfill the objectives of this policy, the
investment management style will be directed towards an active rather
than passive portfolio. The following maximum limits are established
for the Town's total portfolio:
(1) Certificates of deposit: 50%.
(2) United States Treasury notes/bonds/bills: 100%.
(3) United States agencies: 100%.
(4) Common and preferred stock: 10%.
(5) Investment grade corporate bonds: 10%.
B.
§ 401-55 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-56
397:948
§ 401-57. Ethical and prudent action.
In the Town's attempt to obtain its yield objectives, the policies set forth
in this section shall be exercised in such a manner as to maintain the
liquidity necessary to ensure that the next projected disbursement date
and payroll dates are covered.
C.
In the event of the creation of a new or previously unavailable type
of investment vehicle, upon the recommendation of the Treasurer and
upon the written approval of the Town Manager and Finance Director,
the Treasurer may invest in such an instrument to the extent permitted
by this policy.
D.
The Town will establish a system of internal controls over the
investment activities of the Town and document such controls in
writing.
A.
The standard of prudence to be used by the Treasurer shall be the
prudent person standard and shall be applied in the context of
managing an overall portfolio. The Treasurer, acting in accordance
with written procedures and this IPS and exercising reasonable due
diligence, shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual
security's credit risk or market price changes, provided that the
purchases and sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the
terms of this IPS.
B.
The Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer shall refrain from any personal
activity that may conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program or which could impair or appear to impair ability to make
impartial investment decisions. Said individuals shall disclose to the
Chief Executive Officer any material financial interest in financial
institutions that do business with the Town.
C.
It is the Town's policy that investment officers perform their duties in
accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in this manual
and according to the prudent person rule: Investments shall be made
with judgment and care under prevailing circumstances which persons
of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management
of their own affairs, not for speculation but for investment considering
the probable income to be derived. The standard of prudence to be
used by investment officials shall be the "prudent person" and shall
be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment
officers acting in good faith and in accordance with these policies and
exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility
for an individual security's performance, provided that deviations from
expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is
taken to control adverse developments.
D.
All brokers, dealers and advisors to the Town of Barnstable are required
to sign a statement of disclosure as presented in Appendix E.116

397:949
§ 401-58. Authorization.
The Treasurer has authority to invest municipal funds, subject to the
statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts MGL c. 44, §§ 55, 55A and
55B and in accordance with the Town of Barnstable's Investment Policy.
§ 401-59. Investment operating procedures.
The investments of the Town of Barnstable are administered according
to an investment program. The program is formulated by the Treasurer.
The Treasurer will evaluate the program at least monthly. The investment
program is developed by the Treasurer through the following procedures:
§ 401-60. Reporting requirements.
A. Evaluate economic and market analyses.
B. Forecast available cash for investment.
Formulate and execute strategies concerning:
(1) Asset mix.
(2) Investment instruments.
(3) Maturities.
(4) Target yields.
C.
On a quarterly basis, a report containing the following information will
be prepared by the Treasurer and distributed to the Finance Director
and/or his/her designee as appropriate. The quarterly report will
include the following information, as a minimum requirement:
A listing of the individual accounts held at the end of the reporting
period identifying the name of the account, the type of security(ies)
and the market value of each account.
(1)
A summary of the income earned on a monthly basis and year-todate
basis shall be reported.
(2)
A brief statement of general market and economic conditions and
other factors that may affect the Town's cash position.
(3)
A.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Treasurer shall immediately bring
to the attention of the Finance Director any matter of consequence
related to the investment portfolio. Such matters include, but are not
limited to, SEC or other federal or state investigations of any entity
which is an issuer of an instrument found in the Town's investment
portfolio, failure by an entity to pay timely expected dividends, interest
payments or other items of value, defaults in the terms or conditions of

§ 401-73. Purpose and policies.
It is the purpose of this article to provide to all employees the policies
and procedures for assuring maintenance of an equitable human resources
management system in the Town of Barnstable. The policies and procedures
for human resources administration set forth herein have, as their purpose,
to promote the efficiency and economy of government; to promote the
morale and well-being of Town employees; and to promote equal
employment opportunity for all employees and candidates for employment.
The human resources policies are based on the following principles:

Discrimination against any person in recruitment, examination,
appointment, training, promotion, retention or any other human resources
action because of political affiliation, race, creed, color, national origin, age,
sex, handicap, disability, or any other nonmerit factor will be prohibited
except where such factor is a bona fide occupational requirement. Any
employee who feels aggrieved may process an appeal in accordance with
the discrimination complaint procedure in § 401-97, Grievances and
discrimination complaint procedures.
Recruiting, selecting, and developing employees on the basis of their
abilities, knowledge, and skills.

human resources administration without regard to political affiliation,
race, color, national origin, age, sex, creed, handicap, disability, or
any other nonmerit factor, except where such factor is a bona fide
occupational requirement, and with proper regard for their privacy and
constitutional rights as citizens; prohibiting discrimination against any
person on the basis of such nonmerit factors, and

provide to the contrary the terms of the collective bargaining agreement
shall prevail, and further provided that the grievance procedure contained
in § 401-97 does not apply to probationary, seasonal, or temporary
employees. These policies shall serve as a guide to the administration
of a human resources system of the Town of Barnstable in keeping with
basic merit principles. The policies are not all-inclusive; final discretion
as to interpretation and as to the appropriate course of action concerning
a particular human resources matter shall vest with the Town Manager.

Massachusetts State Constitution. To the extent that any apparent conflict
exists, it shall be determined in favor of the higher state statute or provision
of the Massachusetts State Constitution.
§ 401-78. Collective bargaining agreements.

collective bargaining agreement, the terms of the collective bargaining
agreement shall prevail. Where this article contains provisions which are

§ 401-85. Compensation system.
Purpose. The purpose of the classification plan is:
Establish desirable qualification standards for recruiting and
examining purposes.
(1)
Provide a means of analyzing work distribution, area of
responsibility, lines of authority, and other relationships between
positions.
(2)
(3) Assist in determining budget requirements.
(4) Provide a basis for developing standards of work performance.
(5) Establish lines of promotion.
(6) Indicate training needs.
(7) Provide uniform titles for positions.
A.
Administration of classification plan. Each classified position is
allocated to a grade. The Human Resources Director is responsible
for classifying all positions. The Human Resources Director will
recommend changes to the Town Manager for approval. When a new
position is established or when a position has changed substantially
as to the kind and/or level of work, the Town Manager, a department
manager, an employee, or a recognized labor union may initiate a
request for a change in classification by submitting a written request
to the Human Resources Department accompanied by a position
description questionnaire. The Human Resources Director shall
document any changes in the position, its duties and/or responsibilities,
evaluate the position and shall make a recommendation concerning
the reclassification request to the Town Manager. The Town Manager's
decision concerning the classification or reclassification request shall
be final.
B.
Certification of classification change. No employee shall be paid in
any circumstance until the Town Treasurer is presented with proper
authorization on an appropriate form, signed by the Human Resources
Director, Finance Director, and the Town Manager.
C.
Pay policy. The Human Resources Director shall be responsible for the
maintenance of a uniform and equitable pay plan which shall consist,
for each grade of positions, of minimum and maximum rates of pay
and such intermediate steps as are deemed appropriate. Insofar as
it may be practical, the Town Manager shall prepare a schedule of
revisions to the compensation plan, whether negotiated or otherwise,
A.
§ 401-83 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-85
397:960
and include said schedule of revisions for funding through the annual
budget process.
Maintenance of the plan. The Human Resources Director shall prepare
an analysis of prevailing rates of pay for comparable public and private
employment in the area and at large, taking into consideration cost of
living factors, budget affects of various alternative pay plans, and other
factors which may be pertinent in recommending changes in the plan.
B.
Pay administration and appointment rates. An employee appointed to
a position should be normally compensated at the minimum rate of
pay assigned to the grade to which the position is assigned, however,
subject to the approval of the Town Manager, original employment at a
salary above the minimum step may be made upon written certification
by the recommending official and Human Resources Director that such
action is justified by the lack of qualified applicants available at the
minimum rate.
C.
Step increases.
Step increases within an established range are not automatic but
require certification by the immediate supervisor that the employee
is performing at an acceptable level of competence, as
demonstrated in the performance appraisal system. All employees
in an approved position shall be evaluated every six months. An
annual evaluation shall be due in June of each year. Step increases
based on a satisfactory evaluation shall be effective July 1.
(1)
Employees hired in an approved position between July 1 and
December 31 will be evaluated the following June and eligible for
a step increase July 1; employees hired in an approved position
between January 1 and June 30 will be eligible for a step increase
on July 1 of the next calendar year.
(2)
Employees promoted between July 1 of one year and the following
March 31 will be eligible for consideration for a step increase
(based on satisfactory evaluation or better) the following July 1.
Employees promoted between April 1 and June 30 of a calendar
year will be eligible for a step increase on July 1 of the next
calendar year.
The following factors shall not affect eligibility for a step
increase:
[1] Overall pay adjustment resulting from any pay survey.
Transfer within grade, providing supervisory
responsibility remains intact.
[2]
[3] A period of paid leave.
(a)
An employee receiving workers' compensation will not be
eligible for a step increase until the employee returns to work;
(b)
(3)
D.
§ 401-85 WELLS § 401-85
397:961
§ 401-86. Employee benefits.
and the increase will become effective on the date of return to
work, provided that the employee has worked a minimum of six
months during the evaluation period.
Denial of step increases. The denial of a step increase may not always
connote less than satisfactory service of an employee. If funding is not
available, step increases may be denied. Written notice of any denial of
a pay raise and the reasons therefor shall be submitted to the employee
at least 10 calendar days after the due date for the step increase. The
employees' eligibility date for future increases shall remain unchanged.
E.
Reappointment rate. Persons receiving reemployment or reinstatement
appointments may be paid at any step within the pay range not to
exceed the step attained at the time of the separation.
F.
Promotion. Upon promotion, the employee's salary shall be set at the
rate of the higher grade which at least provides an increase in pay.
G.
Transfer. When an employee is transferred from a position in one grade
to a position in another grade at the same pay rate, or is transferred
with no change in grade, he/she shall continue to be paid at the same
rate.
H.
Demotion. When an employee is demoted to a lower grade, his/her
salary shall be set at:
The rate in the lower grade which provides the smallest decrease
in pay; if the action is not for cause; or
(1)
Any appropriate rate, as determined by the appointing authority, in
the lower grade which is less than the existing salary if the action
is for cause.
(2)
I.
Reclassification of position to a grade of a lower pay range. When a
position is reallocated to a grade of a lower pay range, the salary of the
incumbent shall be set as follows:
If the employee's salary in the higher range is above the top step
of the lower range, his/her pay shall remain unchanged. The
employee shall not receive any step increase in pay until the
maximum of the pay range exceeds the employee's rate of pay.
(1)
If the employee's salary in the higher range falls within the lower
range, his/her pay shall remain unchanged.
(2)
J.
Merit bonuses for nonaffiliated human resources. The Town Manager
may, from time to time, grant a one-time annual merit bonus to
nonaffiliated employees who have attained an outstanding performance
appraisal. Such bonus shall not exceed 5% of the employee's base pay.

pay or hours worked, it should be addressed with the Human Resources
Director, and, after appropriate or necessary review with the Legal
Department, a decision will be rendered as it relates to the issue.

Part-time employees shall accrue and take vacation leave based on
50% of the above schedule, or a percentage of time prorated in
accordance with hours or days worked.
(2)
Scheduling of vacations shall be determined by the department
manager or designee with due regard to the needs of the service,
seniority and to the employee's wishes. Department managers and
management officials' requests for vacation leave shall be
submitted to the Human Resources Department after approval by
the Town Manager. The Human Resources Department shall be
notified of all leave taken, on forms provided for such purpose.
(3)
Vacation leave should be taken within the calendar year. As above
any carryover of such leave, to not exceed 10 days, must be
requested in writing from and may be approved by the appointing
authority only if as a result of departmental necessity. Any such
request and approval must be filed with the Human Resources
Director.
(4)
Payment for unused vacation leave. An employee with more than
six months of service whose employment is terminated is entitled
to payment for unused accrued annual leave.
(5)
§ 401-88 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-88
397:966
Vacation as sick leave. Vacation time may be used by employees
in addition to, or in lieu of, sick time with the approval of the
department manager.
(6)
Employees covered by this article shall accrue vacation leave as
indicated under Subsection D(1); however, subject to the approval
of the Town Manager, upon commencement of original
employment, annual vacation leave at a schedule above the
minimum may be made upon written certification by the appointing
authority that such action is justified by exceptional circumstances.
(7)
Sick leave.
Purpose. Sick leave shall not be considered a privilege which an
employee may use at the employee's discretion, but shall be
allowed only in case of actual sickness or disability of the employee,
to meet dental appointments, to take physical examinations, or for
other sickness prevention measures. Sick leave may be taken by
any eligible employee unable to work due to pregnancy, childbirth
and recovery therefrom.
(1)
Eligibility. Sick leave shall be available to all permanent,
provisional, and probationary employees. Seasonal, temporary, and
casual employees are not eligible for sick leave. Permanent, parttime
employees shall accrue sick leave time based on 50% of the
above schedule or a percentage of time prorated in accordance
with hours or days worked. Deliberately self-inflicted injury or
injury occurring while in the employ of others shall not be
considered a proper claim for sick leave.
(2)
Certification of illness. For sick leave in excess of three days,
or if the department manager or designated supervisory official
suspects an abuse of sick leave, the department manager or
supervisory official may require a certificate from the attending
physician stating that such illness prevented the employee from
working. The Town Manager or designee may, at any reasonable
time, require that a medical examination by a physician of his/
her own choosing, be made of any employee. The cost of such
examination shall be borne by the Town.
(3)
Sick leave allowance. Unless provided by labor agreement,
effective July 1, 1998, a permanent, full-time employee shall accrue
sick leave on the basis of 1.25 days for each month in a pay
status up to 15 days per calendar year, and shall be credited with
the unused portion up to a maximum of 150 days. Up to seven
days of sick leave may be used to care for an immediate family
member living within the employee's household. Permanent parttime
employees shall accrue sick leave on a prorated basis in
accordance with the hours and days worked per week, and shall be
credited with the unused portion up to a maximum of 150 days.
(4)
E.
§ 401-88 WELLS § 401-88
397:967
During the first month of employment, an employee whose
effective date of employment is after the 15th day of the month
shall not receive any sick leave credit for that month.
(a)
After having accumulated 120 of days of sick leave, an
employee shall have the right to receive an amount equal to
one full week's pay after any full calendar year of service
during which the employee has used no more than three days
of sick leave during that calendar year.
(b)
Advance of sick leave. Upon written request and under exceptional
circumstances, the Town Manager may advance a specific number
of sick leave days to an employee. It is understood that such
additional days constitute a deficit in accrued sick leave for the
employee and must be repaid by subsequent accrual, where
applicable. Under no circumstances shall such advance leave be
granted to any employee who has accrued sick leave, accrued
vacation, or personal leave available.
(5)
Reporting. The department manager or designee shall file, on
forms provided for such purpose, information regarding the
accrual and taking of any and all leave with the Human Resources
Director.
(6)
Buy-back. An employee, upon retirement, will be paid $60 per day
for any unused sick leave to a maximum of 150 days.
(7)
Injury leave. An employee injured on the job, however slightly, must
report that fact to his immediate supervisor at once. Such supervisor
must give a full report of the incident on the same day or as soon
thereafter as possible and report the incident on appropriate forms to
the Human Resources Department.
Injury leave shall mean leave due to absence from duty caused by
an accident, injury or occupational disease that occurred while the
employee was engaged in the performance of his/her duties.
(1)
Employees covered by workers' compensation insurance may be
paid stated amounts due to injuries sustained on the job; the Town,
in such cases, shall supplement any such payments, at the election
of the employee, so that the employee will receive full pay during
his/her absence (appropriate deductions shall continue to be made)
and such remuneration shall be charged against accrued sick leave
and/or vacation leave until such leave has been exhausted, at which
time such supplementary remuneration shall cease.
(2)
An injured employee eligible to receive payment under workers'
compensation may have a waiting period of up to four weeks before
receiving his/her first compensation check. In such case, the
employee may continue to receive pay, provided that the employee
has sufficient accrual of sick leave or vacation leave to charge
such payment against. The employee, upon receipt of the first
(3)
F.
§ 401-88 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-88
397:968
compensation check, may elect to buy back any sick leave or
vacation time used during the initial waiting period.
Employees in a workers' compensation status for a period in excess
of 30 days will not earn or accumulate vacation or sick leave time.
(4)
Bereavement leave.
The purpose of bereavement leave is to enable an employee to
take care of personal arrangements and problems caused by death
of a member of his/her immediate family and to relieve him/her
of the concern over loss of earnings on the regularly scheduled
workdays immediately following the death. Permanent employees
other than those scheduled for another type of leave are eligible for
bereavement leave, and any such leave granted shall be reported
to the Human Resources Director by the appropriate department
manager.
(1)
Upon the death of employee's spouse, child, parents, significant
other, sister, brother, grandparents, grandchild, mother- and
father-in-law, the employee shall request and the appointing
authority or designee shall grant emergency leave of up to five
working days immediately following such death without loss of pay.
Under exceptional circumstances and upon application approved
by the appointing authority, the department manager may extend
this period.
(2)
G.
Military leave. An employee entering the regular military service will
be provided a leave of absence without pay as required by federal
law. It is the employee’s responsibility to notify his/her department
manager of the dates he/she is leaving for military service and to
provide written proof from military or selective service officials to the
department manager indicating the date of departure and length of
service required. A copy of such proof must be filed with the Human
Resources Department.
Return to work. If an employee requests reinstatement within 90
days after honorable discharge from military service or
hospitalization resulting from military service, he/she will be
rehired with full rights of his/her former job or its equivalent.
(1)
Seniority and benefits. Employees in the military service will
continue to receive credit for seniority accrual.
(2)
Military reserve duty. An employee in the military reserve or the
National Guard shall be paid the difference between total
compensation received while on reserve or Guard duty and regular
compensation rates paid the employee by the Town, not to exceed
15 workdays in any given calendar year, upon submission of
substantiating documentation as may be required by the Human
Resources Department. An employee in the military reserve or
the National Guard who is ordered into the active military service
(3)
H.
§ 401-88 WELLS § 401-88
397:969
shall be paid the difference between total compensation received
while on active duty and his/her base pay, excluding all other
compensation, paid by the Town for the length of his/her activation.
Jury leave. A permanent, full-time employee summoned to jury duty will
be excused from his/her work for the period necessary to perform jury
duty and shall receive the difference in pay between his/her regular
total compensation and jury duty compensation, upon submission of
substantiating documentation as may be required by the Human
Resources Department.
I.
Family medical leave policy. In compliance with the Family Medical
Leave Act of 1993, the Town of Barnstable adopts the following policy

during a twelve-month period under the following definitions and
procedures:
Definitions.
Eligible employee: an employee who has worked for the Town
for at least 12 months and provided at least 1,250 hours of
service during the 12 months preceding the start of the leave.
(Eligible part-time employees' leave will be prorated.)

Family medical leave includes:
[1] The birth, placement for adoption, or foster care of a child;
[2] The serious health condition of a spouse, child, or parent;
[3] The employee's own serious health condition;
To care for covered service members and veterans who

[4]
Any "qualifying exigency" arising out of the fact that a
covered military member serving in the National Guard,

[5]
(b)
Twelve-month period: a "rolling" period measured backward
from the date an employee uses any family medical leave.
(c)
(1)
J.
§ 401-88 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-88
397:970
Serious health condition: an illness, injury, impairment or
physical or mental condition that involves:
Incapacity or treatment as in-patient in a hospital, hospice,
or residential medical-care facility; or
[1]
Incapacity requiring absence from work or other activities
for more than three calendar days and involves continuing
treatment of a health-care provider; or
[2]
Continuing treatment by a health-care provider for chronic
or long-term health condition which is incurable or if left
untreated would result in incapacity for more than three
calendar days.
[3]
(d)
Health-care provider: a doctor of medicine or osteopathy
authorized to practice within located state, or any person
determined by the Secretary of Labor, or others capable of
providing health-care services as defined by the Department of
Labor Family and Medical Leave Act rules.
(e)
Intermittent leave: time away from the job taken in separate
blocks of time due to a single illness or injury.
(f)
Reduced-leave schedule: reduction in the number of hours per

(g)
Procedure.
Notice. Eligible employees will provide written notice of their
intent to use family medical leave to the Director of Human
Resources 30 days in advance when the leave is foreseeable for
the birth or placement of a child or planned medical treatment.
When unforeseen events occur that require family medical
leave, the employee (spouse or family member) must provide
notice as soon as practicable. This would ordinarily mean at
least verbal notification within one or two business days of
when the need for leave becomes known to the employee.
The notice will include the reason for the leave, the date the
leave shall begin, and the intended date of return. The Town
Manager or designee will provide a written response to the
employee within a reasonable amount of time. Leave for the
birth or placement of a child must be taken and concluded
within the 12 months following the birth or placement.
(a)
Medical.
Leave for serious medical conditions must be supported by
certification by a health-care provider. Certification shall
include:
Identification of the practitioner and the type of
medical practice.
[a]
[1]
(b)
(2)
§ 401-88 WELLS § 401-88
397:971
The date the serious health condition commenced and
the probable duration of the condition.
[b]
[c] Diagnosis of the serious health condition.
Statement of the regimen of treatment prescribed for
the condition (including estimated number of visits,
nature, frequency and duration of treatment,
including referred or ordered treatment of other
health-care providers).
[d]
In instances of the employee's serious health
condition:
Statement that the employee is unable to perform
work of any kind; or
[i]
Statement that employee is unable to perform the
essential functions of position (based on
statement of essential functions of the position by
the Director of Human Resources or employee's
department head, using job descriptions
whenever possible).
[ii]
[e]
Instances of care for a family member:
Statement that the family member is in need of
the employee's assistance for basic medical,
hygiene, nutritional needs, safety, or
transportation; or
[i]
Statement that the employee's presence would be
beneficial or desirable for the care of the family
member.
[ii]
[f]
The employee must certify the care he/she will provide and
an estimate of the time period. The certification must be
received with the notice of intent to use family medical
leave or within 15 days of being asked to do so. If the
need for leave was not foreseeable, the employee must
still attempt to provide the certification within 15 days
or as soon thereafter as practical. Certification forms are
available through Human Resources.
[2]
If administration has reason to doubt the validity of a
medical certification, the employee may be required to
obtain a second opinion from a health-care provider
designated by administration at the Town's expense. If
the two opinions differ, administration may require a third
opinion, which will be final and binding, from a health-care
provider mutually agreed to and at the Town's expense.
[3]
§ 401-88 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-88
397:972
Recertification by the health-care provider may be
required every thirty days. Recertification must include
the employee's explicit intent to return to work and a
probable date of return. Recertification may be required
more frequently if:
[a] The employee requests an extension of leave
Significant changes from original certification
circumstances
[b]
Administration's reception of information which casts
doubts upon the continuing validity of the
certification, and
[c]
The inability of the employee to the continuation,
reoccurrence, or onset of a serious health condition.
[d]
[4]
Intermittent leave/reduced schedule. Serious health condition
(employee or family member) family medical leave may be
taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule. Employees
requesting intermittent or reduced schedule family medical
leave must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so
as not to disrupt the Town's operations and administration.
The Town may require a temporary transfer to an alternative
position to better accommodate the reoccurring periods of
leave. In no case will the increment of leave be less than one
hour.
(c)
Paid leave and benefits.
In all circumstances, accrued sick, vacation, and personal
leave, as well as compensatory time, must be used for
qualified family medical leave. Upon depletion of the
available accrued paid leave, the family medical leave
becomes unpaid family medical leave. It is the total of this
time which will equal the twelve weeks of family medical
leave. During any portion of the family medical leave to
which the accrued paid leave is applied, the employee
will continue to accrue benefits and seniority. During any
portion of the family medical leave which is unpaid, the
employee will not accrue same.
[1]
The Town will continue the contribution to the employee's
group health plan during the family medical leave. The
employee will have his/her contribution deducted from
the applied paid leave. Upon the depletion of said leave,
the employee must make arrangements to pay his/her
contribution to the health premiums. If the employee fails
to make his/her premium payment within 30 days of the
depletion of available paid leave, the Town will cease the
maintenance of health coverage. The Town will recover
[2]
(d)
§ 401-88 WELLS § 401-88
397:973
from the employee premiums paid during any period of
unpaid family medical leave if the employee fails to return
to work after the family medical leave entitlement has
expired, except in instance of continuation, reoccurrence,
or onset of qualifying family medical leave circumstances
or other circumstances beyond the control of the
employee.
Restoration to position.
Employees not required to submit medical certification
must submit a report regarding the employee's status and
his/her intent to return to work on a probable date every
30 days. Employees on family medical leave due to their
own serious health condition must submit certification
from the health-care provider that the employee is able to
resume work, i.e., is fit for duty.
[1]
On return from family medical leave, the employee will be
returned to the same or an equivalent position (equivalent
benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of
employment). The employee has no "right" to be returned
to the same position. The Town may deny restoration to a
key employee (one who is salaried and among the highest
paid 10% of employees) if it is necessary to prevent
substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations
of the Town. Key employees will be notified of this status
by administration as soon as practicable, and
administration will notify said employees if restoration is
denied.
[2]
(e)
Denial.
Conditions under which family medical leave and/or
reinstatement may be denied include (but are not limited
to):
[a] Ineligibility of employee;
[b] Unqualified leave under the Family Medical Leave Act;
Employee fails to give timely advance notice for
foreseeable leave temporary denial up to 30 days after
employee provides notice of need);
[c]
Employee fails to provide in a timely manner
requested medical certification (temporary denial up
to time of submittal);
[d]
Employee fails to supply fitness-for-duty certificate
(up to time of submittal);
[e]
[1]
(f)
§ 401-88 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-88
397:974
Employee would not otherwise have been employed if
leave had not been taken;
[f]
Employee unequivocally advises Town of intent not to
return to work;
[g]
[h] "Key" employee status;
[i] Fraudulent acquisition of family medical leave; and
Employment with another employer while on family
medical leave.
[j]
All notifications, certifications, and questions must be
submitted to the Director of Human Resources.
Deliberation, interpretation, and determination will be
based on the Department of Labor Family Medical Leave
Act Rules and Regulations.
[2]
The decisions of the administration are final. Aggrieved
employees may pursue remedies through the U.S.
Department of Labor, Employment Standards
Administration, Wage and Hour Division, or through civil
suit.
[3]
Leave without pay. Upon approval of the appointing authority, or his/
her designee, an employee may be granted leave without pay for a
specified period of time. At the expiration of a leave without pay, the
employee shall return to the position or to a similar position. Failure of
the employee to report promptly at the expiration of such leave shall be
considered a resignation. Leave without pay shall not constitute a break
in service. However, during leave without pay in excess of 30 calendar
days, vacation and sick leave shall not accrue. A copy of any such
approved leave shall be submitted at once to the Human Resources
Department.
K.
Personal leave.
A permanent, provisional or probationary employee may be
granted time off with pay to conduct personal business provided
such leave is approved in advance by the immediate supervisor and
properly recorded on the weekly attendance sheets submitted to
the Human Resources Department.
(1)
Unless pursuant to a union contract, such personal leave shall not
exceed three days in any one calendar year and is not cumulative
from year to year. Personal leave for employees during the first
calendar year of employment only shall not exceed two calendar
days if hired on or after May 1 of that calendar year. Personal leave
for employees, during the first calendar year of employment only,
shall not exceed one calendar day if hired on or after September 1
of that calendar year.

(2)
Assure the granting of increases and consideration for more

B.
§ 401-91 WELLS § 401-92
397:981
appraisal is the continuing day-to-day responsibility of the supervisor.
Each year, prior to effecting a step increase, the employee's supervisor
will make a written evaluation of each employee's performance.
Evaluation for step increase. Prior to an employee's eligibility for
a step increase, the supervisor will review the employee's overall
work performance and certify that the employee is performing
either at an acceptable or unacceptable level of competence for his/
her position. This certification will serve as the basis for granting
or denying the step increase. Certification will be filed with the
Human Resources Director, who will forward step raise approval (if
any) to the Town Manager for approval.
(1)
Annual employee appraisals. The annual appraisal is the summary
of the supervisor's observations of the employee during the past
year and a summary of the performance in terms of a variety
of job-related factors. The appraisal will also include a plan to
develop strengths, identify and improve weak areas, and record
the employee's observations of work assignments in the last year.
Proper use of the performance appraisal serves as a means for
identifying training needs, helping improve individual
performance, recognizing outstanding accomplishments, helping
to strengthen employee/supervisor relationships, emphasizing the
employee's contribution to the Town's programs, helping to identify
strengths and weaknesses in the Town's programs.
(2)
Procedure for annual evaluation.
The supervisor will make a written evaluation of the
employee's job performance considering any changes that
have occurred in the job or other factors which might affect job
performance and noting strengths and capabilities worthy of
special mention and areas where improvement is needed. The
employee and supervisor will then meet to conduct the annual
employee-supervisor discussion.
(a)
Employee-supervisor discussion. The employee and supervisor
will begin the discussion with a review of the employee's
current job description to review and clarify job requirements
and duties assigned, and to note any major changes which
have taken place in the employee's job. The supervisor and
employee should also discuss the employee's career
development plans, special work interests, projects or
assignments of interest, and particular training interests or
needs. The employee's general observations of the
department's programs and especially suggestions for
improving assignments, functions, and work procedures
should be particularly encouraged. The employee should have
the opportunity to discuss any other points and may attach
comments to the supervisor's evaluation. The employee will
(b)
(3)
§ 401-92 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-92
397:982
then certify that he/she has reviewed the appraisal and that it
has been discussed with him/her.
In some instances a second supervisory level will also review
the written evaluation, sign it, and make comments if desired.
The employee will have the opportunity to review and
comment.
(c)
The evaluation will then be forwarded to the Human Resources
Director to become a part of the employee's human resources
record. Supervisors are encouraged to bring significant
program observations and career development plans of
employees to the attention of the appropriate official.
(d)
Performance appraisals.
Newly hired employees who are in a probationary period shall
be evaluated at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the
probationary period. The supervisor or appropriate management
official shall make a positive determination that the employee is
performing in a satisfactory manner prior to the end of the
probationary period; and shall file a copy of this determination with
the Human Resources Department.
(1)
Permanent employees who receive a less than satisfactory
performance rating shall have their step increase, which is due in
July of each calendar year, delayed for six months, at which time
it will be granted if performance is brought up to a completely
satisfactory level, or denied if performance remains below
satisfactory.
(2)
If an employee is rated unsatisfactory, the step increase will be
denied for the year.
(3)
C.
Performance counseling. Any employee who exhibits substandard work
performance should be counseled in the following manner:
Initial counseling. For the first indication of substandard work
performance the supervisor should advise the employee of his/
her unsatisfactory performance and recommend specific areas for
improvement and establish a specific time period for improvement.
A written record may be retained within the employee's
department.
(1)
Written documentation. If performance continues to be
substandard, the supervisor will state in writing:
The specific deficiencies observed in the employee's
performance;
(a)
(b) The necessary improvement;
(c) The period of time in which improvement must occur, and

397:983
§ 401-93. Training.
What further action will result if the employee fails to show
satisfactory improvement.
(d)
Signatures. The written counseling memo should be signed by both
the employee and the supervisor and shall be maintained within the
department. If the employee refuses to sign, the supervisor should
have a witness sign that a copy was given to the employee. The
employee's signature indicates receipt of the document only, not
necessarily acceptance of its contents.
(3)
Responses to continued substandard performance. If an employee
continues to exhibit substandard work performance beyond the
established time limits and below the expected level, the options
available to the employee and supervisor will include
reassignment, demotion, or termination.
(4)
Policy. It shall be the joint responsibility of the appointing authority
or designee and Human Resources Director to foster and promote
employee training programs, contingent upon funding, for the purpose
of improving the quality of personal service rendered to citizens and
aiding employees to equip themselves for advancement in the service.

skills for growth into other positions in the Town service. The
supervisor should forward a written report of training needs, through
department managers to the Human Resources Director. Department
managers should, through contact with the Human Resources Director
and the public community, keep themselves apprised of training
programs that may be of help or interest both to themselves and to their
employees, and should nominate employees for appropriate training
courses.
Educational tuition reimbursement policy. To encourage Town
employees to further their educational, professional, and vocational
development, the Town will reimburse the cost of tuition and
nonrefundable fees for courses related to the employee's current
position taken from an accredited college, university, or technical
school according to established reimbursement rate schedules and
budget limitations.
Eligibility. All regular, full-time employees are eligible to
participate in the tuition reimbursement program. It is not the

any individual who is receiving or is eligible to receive assistance
from such other sources as scholarships, grants, and other subsidy
programs (e.g., GI. Bill).
(1)
Limitations. Employees are limited to three courses per fiscal year
with a maximum allowance of $500 per course.

and health program and for providing safe facilities and guidelines for
ensuring the safety of human resources. It is understood that safety is
also the responsibility of each employee. Supervisors are encouraged
to develop proper attitudes toward safety and health in themselves and
in those they supervise to ensure that all operations are performed
with the utmost regard for the safety of all human resources involved
including themselves. Employees are expected to accept safety and
health guidelines to prevent injuries in the workplace. Departments

disciplinary action is considered warranted.
(m)
Procedures for disciplinary action.
Oral reprimand. Whenever grounds for disciplinary action exist,
including but not limited to abuse of leave, absenteeism,
insubordination, misconduct, or failure to follow established safety
rules, and the supervisor determines that more severe action is not
immediately necessary, the supervisor should orally communicate
to the employee the supervisor's observation of the deficiency and
offer assistance in correcting the deficiency. At this point some
specific time period should be established between the supervisor
and the employee during which the problem should be corrected
before any further action is taken. Whenever possible, sufficient
time for improvement should precede formal disciplinary action.
No notation in the employee's human resources file is necessary.
If no incidents of the behavior which gave cause for the oral
reprimand occurs in a twelve-month period of time, the reprimand
will be considered nullified.
(1)
Written reprimand. A written reprimand shall be addressed to
the employee and will include: the charge; the specific behavior
and the dates of the behavior (where appropriate) that support
the charge; the warning that continuance of this behavior will
(2)
B.
§ 401-95 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-95
397:988
result in more severe disciplinary action; an offer of assistance in
correcting the behavior; any circumstances affecting the severity
of the discipline; and advice on right of appeal. (See § 401-97.) A
signed copy of the reprimand shall be sent to the Human Resources
Director and shall be included in the employee's human resources
file, and the employee will have the opportunity to submit
comments for the human resources folder. Both documents will be
purged from an employee's file at the end of 12 months.
Suspension. The manager of a department or designee (division
supervisors) may suspend an employee, without pay, for up to, but
not exceeding, 30 calendar days. On or before the effective date
of the suspension, the employee will be furnished with a written
statement setting forth reasons for suspension, the effective dates
of the suspension, and the date the employee should return to
work. The statement will also include the charge; the specific
behavior and the dates of the behavior (where appropriate) that
support the charge; the warning that continuance of this behavior
will result in more sever disciplinary action; and offer of assistance
in correcting the behavior; any circumstances affecting the severity
of the discipline; and advice on right to appeal. (See § 401-97.)
In certain instances, an immediate suspension may be warranted.
(i.e., intoxication, assault, etc.) When this occurs, the employee
may immediately be suspended, provided that the matter is
coordinated with the Human Resources Department prior to the
suspension. The employee will be notified within one working day
regarding the length, terms, and reasons for the suspension as well
as advice on rights of appeal. (See § 401-97.)
(3)
Dismissal. The Town Manager or designee may terminate an
employee after due consultation with the Human Resources
Director and the departmental manager recommending the
dismissal. The employee must be given a written notice signed by
the Town Manager specifying the effective date of the termination,
the charge, the specific behavior and the dates (where appropriate)
that support the charge, any circumstances affecting the severity
of the discipline, and advice on right of appeal. (See § 401-97.)
(4)
Disciplinary action is generally a progressive procedure; however,
suspension or dismissal may be the initial step taken in a
disciplinary action depending upon the severity of the grounds for
disciplinary action.
(5)
When any formal disciplinary action is taken, a copy will be
forwarded to the Human Resources Department and placed in the
employee's official human resources file.
(6)
Privacy and information. In all instances, both the employee's right to
privacy and the right of the public to have access to public information
shall be preserved, by observance of the appropriate statutes and laws
governing both.

§ 401-95 WELLS § 401-96
397:989
§ 401-96. Grievance and discrimination complaint procedures.
Grievance and discrimination complaint rights. Any employee who feels
that he/she has received inequitable treatment because of some
condition of employment or who feels he/she has been discriminated
against on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, sex, creed,
handicap or any other nonmerit factor may personally, or through his/
her representative, appeal for relief from that condition. A nonselected
applicant for employment who believes he/she was unlawfully
discriminated against in the examining and selection may also appeal. It
is understood that issues involving the increase or decrease of general
wage rates or salaries and issues not having to do directly and primarily
with the day-to-day working life of the employee and relationships with
his/her supervisor shall not be considered the subject of a grievance.
The employee or applicant may be represented by a party of his/
her choosing at any step in the procedure. Failure by the employee
or applicant or his/her representative to proceed to a higher step
within the time period specified will terminate the grievance. Failure by
management to render a decision within the allotted time at any step
constitutes denial, and the employee may then proceed to the next step.
A.
Grievance procedure. Unless otherwise provided for in an applicable
labor agreement and except for probationary, seasonal or temporary
employees, all grievances shall be handled in accordance with the
following procedures. Related grievances may be consolidated and
processed as a single issue. Every effort will be made to resolve the
grievance at the lowest possible level. The steps follow:
Informal procedure: When an employee feels aggrieved, he/she
should contact his/her supervisor within three days of the incident
causing the alleged grievance. The supervisor should discuss the
issues and make a determination within one working day of being
contacted.
(1)
Step 1: If the issue remains unresolved, the employee may present
his/her grievance to his/her department head. If the department
head cannot make an immediate solution satisfactory to both
parties, the employee shall resume his/her regular duties. If the
dispute involves the employee's workload or schedule, he/she shall
continue to work as assigned until the dispute shall be resolved. If
the grievance is not resolved, the employee shall prepare a written
statement of the grievance, which shall be submitted to the Human
Resources Director within seven working days of the immediate
supervisor's decision.
(2)
Step 2: The Human Resources Director shall accept, review, and
hear all such grievances, timely appealed; shall require and receive
such documents as may pertain to the grievance; and may require
the attendance of any Town official or employee it believes to
have information; and may hold a hearing and receive testimony
and recommend a disposition of the grievance to the appointing
(3)
B.
§ 401-96 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-96
397:990
authority within 10 days of the completion of its investigation of the
matter.
Step 3: The appointing authority shall render a final decision on
the matter within 10 working days after receipt of the Human
Resources Director's recommendation.
(4)
Discrimination complaint procedure. All discrimination complaints shall
be handled in accordance with the following procedure;
Step 1: An employee who feels that she/he has been discriminated
against should report it to her/his supervisor. If the issue is not
resolved to the satisfaction of the employee, or if the employee
for any reason does not feel comfortable reporting said compliant
to her/his supervisor, she/he should submit a written statement of
the discrimination complaint within 10 working days of the date
he/she becomes cognizant of the discrimination. The complaint
must be submitted to the appointing authority or designee. The
complaint must state the basis of the discrimination, the actions
giving rise to the discrimination. An applicant who believes she/he
has been discriminated against should report her/his complaint to
the appointing authority or designee.
(1)
Step 2: The appointing authority or designee is authorized to
conduct the investigation and to require all employees of the
department to cooperate with the investigation. Every attempt
shall be made to complete the investigation within 15 workdays of
receipt of the complaint. The investigation shall include a thorough
review of the circumstances under which the alleged
discrimination occurred; the treatment of members of the
complainant's group identified by his/her complaint as compared
with the treatment of other employees in the organizational
segment in which the alleged discrimination occurred; and any
policies and practices related to the work situation which may
constitute, or appear to constitute, discrimination even though
they have not been expressly cited by the complainant. Sufficient
information should be gathered through a survey of the general
environment out of which the complaint arose, so that any
improper discrimination in the organizational segment involved in
the complaint can be detected, wherever possible, so that remedial
action can be taken; and any allegation of discrimination not
supported in any way by the facts can be identified as such so
that the alleged discriminatory official can be exonerated. The
scope of this survey may vary from case to case, depending on
the circumstances encountered. Some cases may point up the need
for a broad survey, covering the full range of significant human
resources actions with which the alleged discriminatory official
was involved (such as appointments, details, disciplinary actions,
performance evaluations, promotions, and training assignments)
in, for example, the two-year period immediately preceding the
complaint. As a general rule, when the results of the investigation
(2)
C.
§ 401-96 WELLS § 401-96
397:991
are inconclusive, additional investigation should be undertaken
where this is feasible.
Step 3: The Equal Employment Officer will receive and consider
the results of investigation and will render a written decision to
the complainant and other involved parties within five workdays of
receipt of the investigator's findings.
(3)
Step 4: If the complaint is not resolved, the complainant may
appeal to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination
and/or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in
accordance with approved procedures of such agency.
(4)
Sexual harassment policy. It is the policy of the Town that no employee
shall be subjected to sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is defined
as sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or
physical conduct of a sexual nature when submission to or rejection
of such advances, requests or conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of employment or as a basis for
employment decisions; or such advances, requests or conduct have
the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's
work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating or
sexually offensive work environment.
D.
Procedures for handling sexual harassment complaints. Every
employee of the Town of Barnstable has the right to work in an
environment free from sexual harassment. The Town has designated
a Sexual Harassment Officer who will promptly and thoroughly
investigate all complaints. The following sexual harassment complaint
procedure has been developed specifically to insure an orderly and
fair investigation process which protects the civil rights of all parties
involved.
An employee who feels that she/he has been sexually harassed
should report a sexual harassment compliant to her/his supervisor
as soon as possible. If the issue is not resolved to the satisfaction
of the employee, or if the employee for any reason does not feel
comfortable reporting said complaint to his/her supervisor, she/he
should report the complaint to the Sexual Harassment Officer. The
employee will have a private meeting with the officer, at which time
the officer will document the complaint. The officer's account of the

(1)
I.
§ 401-99 BARNSTABLE CODE § 401-99
397:1004
Tangible benefits: cost savings or revenue generating. The
award will be based on 15% of the first year's net cost savings
or revenue generated, with a maximum of $5,000 dollars per
suggestion.
(a)
No final award will be given until the suggestion's savings have
been actualized. The actualized savings report will be reviewed
by the Finance Department.
(b)
The award shall be made from the account to which the savings
or revenue accrue.
(c)
If the first year's net estimated benefits were incorrect and the
error resulted in the underpayment to the employee, the employee
will be paid the appropriate additional award amount, upon an
audit conducted annually by the Finance Department, in
consultation with the BEST Committee and program coordinator.
In the case of group suggestions all eligible suggesters who have
signed the suggestion form will receive an equal share of the cash
award.
(2)
The Town of Barnstable reserves the right to amend the BEST
program award structure at any time and without prior notice.
(3)
BEST awards made to Town of Barnstable employees for
suggestions are subject to FICA and income tax withholding.
(4)
Evaluation and implementation.
The evaluation process will answer the following questions
concerning any suggestion:
(a) Is the suggestion an improvement over what currently exists?
(b) Can the suggestion be implemented?
(c) What are the benefits (tangible and/or intangible)?
If the suggestion is not an improvement or cannot be
implemented, why not?
(d)
(1)
Although each suggestion is different and will have to be evaluated
for each specific situation, an overview of the evaluation process is
as follows:
All suggestions will be evaluated in accordance with the policy
and procedures established by the BEST coordinator.
(a)
The program coordinator will send a copy of each suggestion,
with a blank evaluation form, to the department manager in
the affected department(s).
(b)
(2)
J.
§ 401-99 WELLS § 401-99
397:1005
Once the evaluation by the department manager has been
completed, a report will then be forwarded to the BEST
program coordinator.
(c)
BEST program guidelines allow 60 calendar days to evaluate any
suggestion. If the program coordinator determines that additional
time is required to evaluate or test the suggestion, he/she must
notify the BEST Committee immediately with an approximate date
of completion.
(3)
BEST Program guidelines allow 28 calendar days for the initial
implementation of approved suggestions. It is important that this
time period be adhered to as closely as possible since no
suggesters will be paid awards until the suggestion has been
implemented and evaluated. If additional time is needed for
implementation it should be coordinated through the BEST
program coordinator.
(4)
Role of the program coordinator. The program coordinator's
responsibility is to gather facts, make a decision on the facts and,
if appropriate, have the suggestion implemented. The program
coordinator shall give careful consideration to the following:
(1) Be objective, do not let personalities influence the evaluation;
Approach the evaluation in a positive manner and look for ways the
idea can be used rather than way it cannot;
(2)
(3) Thoroughly investigate all possibilities for adoption;
Review records, files, and other background documentation
pertaining to the suggestion;
(4)
Talk to the employees involved in the current process, operation or
activity;
(5)
Be factual. A factually complete evaluation reveals to the suggester
that the idea received a professional and objective review.
(6)
K.
Legal aspects.
The Town of Barnstable has the exclusive right to determine award
policy and structure, and retains the right to revise the terms and
conditions of the program, or to terminate it any time without
notice.

conclusive, including eligibility of employees, acceptance or
rejection of a suggestion, the value or benefit of a suggestion, and

of Dogs of the Code of the Town of Barnstable.
A.
These regulations are intended to guide those persons owning or
keeping dogs within the Town of Barnstable in their role as responsible
pet owners. Although it is hoped these regulations will act as an
educational tool, it must also be understood that enforcement of same
is necessary to protect the rights and safety of the public. Any owner/
keeper seeking relief from any portion of these regulations may file or
appeal for same with the Town Manager.
B.
The owner or keeper of a dog kept within the Town of Barnstable, said
dog being six months of age or older, shall cause that dog to be licensed
annually. The license year shall be from July 1 to the following June 30,
inclusive.
A.
The Town Clerk shall issue dog licenses and tags on a form as
prescribed by the Town Manager. The Clerk shall record for each
license issued, the name, address and telephone number of the owner
or keeper of each dog so licensed, the tag number issued, date of last

the year of issue.

license fee or part thereof shall be refunded because of a subsequent
death, loss, spaying or neutering, or removal from the Town of such
dog. A late fee of $5 will be assessed to individuals who license the
animal from August 1 of each year to December 31 of each year. Any
person who licenses the animal from January 1 to June 30 for the prior
year will be assessed a late fee of $10. This does not apply for newly
acquired dogs or for individuals who have moved into Town less than
30 days prior to licensing. License fees shall be reviewed annually in
accordance with the Town of Barnstable ordinances. All dogs must be
licensed every year. If a dog owner fails to license or relicense a dog

therein. The name and address of the owner of each dog kept in any
kennel, if other than the person maintaining the kennel, shall be kept
on file thereat and available for inspection by any authorized agent

order revoke or suspend, and in the case of suspension may reinstate, such
license. Upon written petition of 25 residents, filed with the Town Manager,
setting forth that they are aggrieved, or annoyed to any unreasonable
extent, by one or more dogs at a kennel, because of excessive barking or
vicious disposition of said dogs or other conditions connected with such
kennel constituting a public nuisance, the Town Manager, or his authorized
agent, within seven days after the filing of such petition, shall give notice
to all parties in interest of a public hearing to be held within 14 days
after the date of such notice. Within seven days after such public hearing
the Town Manager shall make an order either revoking or suspending
such kennel license or otherwise regulating said kennel, or dismissing said
petition. The holder of such license may petition the District Court for relief
in accordance with Massachusetts General Law Chapter 140, § 137C. Any
person maintaining a kennel after the license therefor has been so revoked,
or while such license is so suspended, may be punished by a fine of $50 for
each day in violation of said revocation or suspension.

an area for the selling or boarding of dogs for other than medical
purposes, in which case it shall apply for a kennel license. The license
period for a kennel license shall be from July 1 to the following June 30,

The permittee shall, in accordance with Massachusetts General
Laws, give proper and timely notice to public utilities before
making any excavation in a public way. The permittee shall not
interfere with any utility. If it becomes necessary to relocate an
existing utility, this shall be done by its owner, and the cost of
such work shall be paid for by the permittee. The permittee shall
inform itself as to the existence and location of all underground
facilities and protect the same against damage. The permittee
shall adequately support and protect by timbers, sheeting, shoring,
etc., all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, cables or other appurtenance
which may be, in any way, affected by the excavation work, and

such repairs paid for by the permittee. The permittee shall be
responsible for any damage done to any public or private property
by reason of the breaking of any water, sewer, drains or gas pipes,
wire, conduits or other such similar type appurtenance.
(2)
Monuments. The permittee shall engage the services of a registered
land surveyor to reset any survey boundary monuments disturbed
during the course of work. All disturbed monuments shall be reset
within 30 days of the completion of construction activities. The
registered land surveyor shall certify in writing to the Director that the
monuments have been properly placed.
F.
Trees. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or
shrubs which exist within the public right-of-way without first obtaining
permission from the Town Tree Warden. In the event that a tree or a
shrub is damaged, destroyed or is authorized for removal, the permittee
shall replace the tree or shrub at his/her expense. The species, size
and place of relocation shall be determined by the Tree Warden. In
addition, if three or more trees are involved in a permit all chipable
material including branches and slash up to four inches in diameter
shall be reduced to chips and delivered to the Department of Public
Works, Highway Division, located at 382 Falmouth Road (Route 28),
Hyannis. All tree stumps and debris resulting form such work will be
removed from the work site at permittee' s expense.
G.

§ 404-24. Breaking through pavement, backfilling, and patching.
result in revocation of the permit and, if applicable, the loss of the
contractors' or subcontractors' certification.
Breaking through pavement.
Approved cutting of bituminous pavement surface prior to
excavations is required in order to confine pavement damage to
the limits of the trench. Pavement will be saw cut unless otherwise
approved by the Director.
(1)
Sections of bituminous or cement concrete sidewalks shall be
removed to the nearest score line or approved saw cut edge.
(2)
Unstable pavement shall be removed over cave-outs and overbreaks
and the subgrade shall be treated as the main trench.
(3)
Pavement edges shall be trimmed to a vertical face and neatly
aligned parallel with the center line of the trench.
(4)
Cutouts outside of the trench lines must be regular and aligned
parallel and/or perpendicular to the center line of the trench.
(5)
Trenches and excavations shall be braced and sheathed when
necessary as required to comply with OSHA specifications.
(6)
Road surface openings shall be restricted for a period of five years
after a new permanent surface is laid, except in cases of extreme
emergency. When in the opinion of the Director an extreme
emergency does not exist, driving, dry boring, coring or jacking
methods may be used to accomplish the installation subject to the
approval of the Director. Extreme care must be taken to protect
existing underground utilities at all times.
(7)
When excavation is permitted in roads resurfaced within the past
three years, the permittee must install a bituminous concrete patch
the full width of the roadway and at least 30 feet beyond the
affected area with one inch of dense graded bituminous concrete
unless otherwise authorized by the Director. Utility companies
placing utilities in a shallow trench (zero feet to five feet) in depth
and narrow trenches (one foot to three feet) in width may in certain
instances be exempt form the bituminous concrete patch at the
discretion of the Director.
(8)
A.
Backfilling. The excavation in the road must be filled and resurfaced
during the same day it is opened unless otherwise allowed by the
Director or his/her designee. The trench shall be backfilled with clean
gravel in no more than six-inch mechanically tamped layers. Excavated
material may be used if determined suitable by the Director, to within
10 inches of the finished grade with approved material, and then six
inches of three-quarter-inch dense graded material shall be placed and
B.
§ 404-23 BARNSTABLE CODE § 404-24
404:1100
compacted into the trench, and the remaining four inches shall be filled
with the bituminous concrete patch. The road surface shall be precut
to avoid damaging surfaces surrounding the trench. The backfill and
dense graded material in the trench must be mechanically tamped to
95% of maximum dry density as determined by the Modified Procter
Test in accordance with ASTM-l557 method.
Patches/repairs.
Permanent patching. The permanent patching of bituminous
concrete base and top shall be laid and rolled in two courses and
shall be done within six months of the initiation of excavation. The
binder (base course) shall be 2 1/2 inches in compacted thickness,
and the top course shall be 1 1/2 inches in compacted thickness.
The minimum total thickness of both courses, measured after
rolling, shall be four inches. The base course of the permanent
pavement shall be placed, carefully raked and thoroughly rolled
to the required thickness. Before placing the base course of the
pavement, the edge of the original pavement surface shall be
cleaned of all dirt, dust and debris and then received an application
of approved asphalt emulsion so that the new pavement material
may be properly bonded to the old. The joint between the old and
new pavement at the road surface intersection will then have an
application of asphalt emulsion of at least one foot in width applied
to it. The permanent paving shall not overlap the existing pavement
and will not have to be applied with a mechanical spreader unless
otherwise directed. The permittee shall furnish, place, grade and
compact bituminous concrete pavement of Class I Type 1-1 as
shown and specified in the latest Massachusetts Department of
Public Works Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges.
The permittee shall maintain permanent patches for a period of 18
months or until infrared patching treatment is completed.
(1)
Infrared patch treatment. Between six months and 18 months after
the permanent patch is placed, the patch shall be heated up
utilizing an infrared machine, and the patch surface reconstructed
and blended with the existing surrounding pavement. The result
shall be a smooth rideable surface. During the process additional
bituminous concrete material will be added as required. The
infrared equipment used must be approved by the Director. This
work will be contracted for by the Department and paid for from
part of the fees levied as part of the permit process.
(2)
Temporary patches. Under certain conditions, the Director may
authorize the installation of a temporary patch. Temporary patches
shall preferably be hot Class I Type 1-1 bituminous concrete but
may be substituted for with cold mix if hot mix is unavailable and
the substitution is authorized by the Director. The patch shall be
laid and compacted in two courses to a minimum of four inches
total of compacted thickness to a finished grade matching the
existing road surface. Temporary patches shall be removed and
(3)
C.
§ 404-24 EXCAVATIONS § 404-24
404:1101
replaced with permanent patches within 180 days following
placement of the temporary patch. The permittee shall maintain
temporary patches and within 24 hours of notification by the Town
fill with similar material any depressions and holes that may occur
so as to maintain the surface in a safe and satisfactory condition.
Pavement overlay. Under certain circumstances a one-inch thick
bituminous overlay for the full section of the road, and extending 30
feet beyond the area affected by the road patch may be required.
Generally, this will be required when the patch was made on a road that
was resurfaced in the last five years or when a patch is fairly extensive.
Where overlays are required they will be noted on the permit.
D.
Testing. If required by the Director the applicant will engage at no cost
to the Town a certified testing company acceptable to the Department,
to sample and test materials and/or compaction. Any deficiencies will
be corrected by the applicant. Testing and sampling may include but
will not be limited to compaction tests, soil sieve analysis, bituminous
concrete density tests, pavement corings and nuclear density testing.
E.
Trenches. Unless a shorter length is specified by the Director the
maximum length of open trench permissible at any one time shall be
limited to no more than 300 feet. No greater length shall be open
for pavement removal, excavation, construction or backfilling without
written permission of the Director.
F.
Restoration of pavement markings. All permanent pavement markings,
crosswalks, traffic center lines etc., which are obliterated or damaged
during construction shall be repainted by or under the direction of the
Department at the expense of the permittee.
G.
Lawn surfaces and plantings. All grassed surfaces which are disturbed
shall be replaced with six inches of screened loam, limed, fertilized and
reseeded with a good quality perennial lawn seed or sodded. Likewise
any areas containing plantings shall be restored to their original
condition with the same or similar plantings. Special care shall be taken
to insure the areas are relandscaped to meet the conditions which
existed before the excavation. The permittee shall water and otherwise
maintain grass and other vegetation and shall guarantee its survival for
a period of 12 months.
H.
Shoulders. Shoulders which are disturbed shall be reconstructed to
previously existing grade and, regardless of its prior existing condition,
shall be loamed with six inches of loam, limed, fertilized and seeded
with good quality perennial lawn seed.

ARTICLE I
Administration and Enforcement
§ 405-1. Authority.
These rules and regulations are made by the Town Manager of the Town
of Barnstable, under the authority of Chapter 32, Article II, § 32-7, of the
Town of Barnstable Code. These regulations shall supersede any former
marina regulations and shall continue in force until rescinded or replaced
by the Town Manager, or until the authority to make and enforce marina
regulations has been repealed. The Town Manager, using his or her
discretion, may deviate from the regulations noted below if deemed to be in
the best interest of the Town of Barnstable.
§ 405-2. Slipholder agreement provisions.
The following subsections are hereby made part of these regulations and
shall appear in every application for berth executed by a boat owner:
The intent of these regulations is to operate the marinas of the Town
in a manner which is fair and uniform to all slipholders, including
potential slipholders whose names appear on the wait list for a slip.
Any interpretation of these regulations by the Town, or agents of the
Town, shall be made with the basic premise that a slip is to be used
for the personal and sole use of the slipholder and that the rental
value of the slips themselves is an asset of the Town that must not
be diverted by private parties. Therefore, the slipholder hereby agrees
that any deviation from this premise by the slipholder shall result in
the termination of any slip rental agreement and further, the Town
may recover any amounts received by the slipholder from other parties
which are essentially in the nature of payment for the use of the slip.
A.
The slipholder also understands and agrees that if it is the opinion of
the Town of Barnstable, or its agents, that there may be a violation of
any of the marina rules and regulations, or their intent, it shall be at
the option of the Town to require the slipholder to provide any and all
testimony or documentation which may be necessary to prove to the
satisfaction of the Town that they are not in violation of the rules and
regulations. Any slipholder who does not respond and show evidence on
his behalf within two weeks of receipt of such request, or any slipholder
who fails to meet to the Town's satisfaction all marina regulations or
their intent, shall relinquish the rights to the slip and all fees shall be
forfeited to the Town.
B.
Furthermore, the slipholder hereby agrees that any violations of these
regulations shall constitute reason for the removal of the vessel to a
place away from the slip, such as a mooring, other anchorage, or dry
storage. The slipholder agrees to indemnify and hold the Town, and its
agents, harmless for any damage to his vessel or for the cost of towage
or storage in connection herewith.
C.
§ 405-1 EXCAVATIONS § 405-3
404:1121
§ 405-3. Violations and penalties.
All directives of the Harbormaster or his deputies must be complied with
immediately and in full. Failure to comply with the directives and the above
rules and regulations can be cause for the loss of the slip, its fees, and the
removal of the vessel from the marina at the owner's expense. Furthermore,
any violation of these rules and regulations shall be considered a violation
of the provisions of Chapter 32, Article II, § 32-7, of the Code of the Town of
Barnstable, and is punishable by a fine not to exceed $200 for each offense.
Each day such offense continues constitutes a separate offense. Any boat
owner shall have the right of appeal to which he/she feels aggrieved and
said appeals process may continue through the office of the Town Manager
and/or any other avenue available through due process of law.
§ 405-4. Slip application; waiting list; fees.
Individuals desiring to lease dock space at any Town-owned marina
must make application in writing to the Harbormaster's Department.
All vacancies occurring in dock space shall be filled from the
established waiting list. A waiting list for dock space has been
established and is maintained indefinitely. Applicants for dock space
have been recorded in chronological order, and the awarding of dock
space shall follow this order. In order for an applicant to maintain his/
her status on the list, he/she must notify the Harbormaster's office in
writing between January 1 and March 15 of each year of his/her desire
to remain on the list. A nonrefundable initiation fee of $15 for Town of
Barnstable residents and a fee of $25 for nonresidents must accompany
the applicant's request to be placed on the waiting list. An annual,
nonrefundable maintenance fee of $5 for residents, and a fee of $10
for nonresidents must accompany the applicant's request to remain on
the waiting list. For the purpose of these regulations, a taxpaying real
estate owner shall be considered a resident as well. All fees collected
on behalf of the applicant shall be applied to the first year's dockage.
Failure to comply with the above will result in the removal of the
applicant's name from the list and all fees will be forfeited.
A.
Effective May 15, 1994, no additional applications will be accepted for
the waiting list. A moratorium shall be in effect until the present waiting
list has been diminished and all applicants have either been awarded a
dock or have been removed from the list for failure to perform. From
that time forth, the waiting list shall be filled through a lottery system,
open to all, and placement upon the list shall be in the order by which
the name of the applicant was drawn. The Town, at its discretion, shall
determine the number of applicants to be placed upon the waiting list.
All applicants, upon their selection through the lottery system, shall be
subject to the fee system as above, and all other rules and regulations
as they pertain to this document. When an appropriate slip becomes
available, the Harbormaster will notify the applicant of the vacancy,
and the applicant shall have first right of refusal on leasing the slip.
Should the applicant not accept the offer of the slip, the applicant may
B.
§ 405-3 BARNSTABLE CODE § 405-4
404:1122
waive that slip but elect to remain on the top of the wait list for the
next available slip. The vacant slip shall then be offered to the next
eligible applicant until the vacancy is filled. It shall be the responsibility
of the applicant to notify the Harbormaster's Office of any change in
the address or phone number or any other significant changes to the
application.

ARTICLE II
Slip Usage Regulations
§ 405-5. Reassignment of slips.
Boat owners assigned slips shall not allow any other vessel to occupy said
slip, and no vessel may enter any other than assigned. Slips assigned by
the Harbormaster may not be reassigned by the owner to any other person
or legal entity. A slip may not be reassigned by the owner to any other
vessel other than the vessel originally assigned the slip, including any vessel
purchased by the owner. The Town's Harbormaster, however, using his/her
discretion and after a receipt of a written recommendation of approval from
the Town's Waterways Committee, may permit such assignment as in the
case of a vessel change request.
§ 405-6. New vessels.
§ 405-7. Approval of changes in slip assignment; guidelines.
If a lessee wishes to purchase a new vessel, he/she must complete and
submit an application for berth of new vessel to the Town's Waterways
Committee and to the Harbormaster for consideration. The application
for berth of new vessel must be completed in its entirety, and all
required documents as noted on the application must be submitted at
the time of submittal. Failure to comply shall result in the immediate
denial of the application for berth of new vessel request.
A.
The Harbormaster or agent of the Town of Barnstable and/or the Town's
Waterways Committee shall have the authority to request any financial
or related document pertaining to the purchase and/or operation of
the requested new vessel, including, but not limited to, a purchase
and sales agreement, bill of sale, abstract of title, sales tax payment,
insurance certificate, mortgage contract, corporate minutes/papers.
B.
The applicant also shall agree to and understands that his/her vessel
shall not be operated through a management company and must be
able to substantiate, by documentation, that he/she is in fact the sole
owner and sole beneficiary of any business or recreational use of the
slip.
C.
If a boat owner desires a change in slip assignment he/she must secure
approval of the Town's Harbormaster after receipt of a recommendation
from the Town's Waterways Committee.
A.
Guidelines for reassignment of slips.
The Town of Barnstable reserves the right to reassign slips within
its marinas in a fashion which is deemed to be in the best interest
of the Town and reserves the right to vary this policy in any fashion
which would better serve the interest of the Town. As a general
guideline, it shall be the policy of the Town to consider any request
(1)
B.
§ 405-5 EXCAVATIONS § 405-7
404:1125
§ 405-8. Boat ownership restrictions.
Boat slips will be leased to individuals only. No boat slip shall be leased
to any corporation, company, partnership, association or any form of
combination of persons. It is the intent of this regulation to provide the
periodic turnover in boat slips. No survivorship rights are allowed or
intended. The lessee and the owner of the vessel shall be one and the same.
The full name(s) of the owner or owners of the vessel and the percent of
ownership each owner claims to said vessel must be accurately stated upon
for a change in slip assignment by a slipholder to be acted upon
according to the following policy:
Any request for a change in slip assignment shall be made in
writing by the slip holder and shall state in full the reason for
the request.
(a)
All requests received shall be time stamped by the
Harbormaster Division.
(b)
All requests shall only be effective from the date of receipt until
all slips have been assigned for the forthcoming season.
(c)
Upon declaration by the Harbormaster that all slips have been
properly filled for the season, all requests shall be deemed null
and void.
(d)
The request of a current slip holder to change his/her slip
assignment, may be considered for the following reasons,
prioritized and weighted according to the following order:
(a) The present slip is incompatible with the present vessel.
The purchase, or intended purchase, of a larger or smaller
vessel within the calendar year.
(b)
The request of the slipholder for a change in slip assignment
for personal preferences.
(c)
(2)
The request for a change in slip assignment, may be granted, but
not guaranteed, provided that:
(a) A slip has been vacated by a prior lease holder.
The vessel owned by the next person on the wait list is not
compatible with the vacated slip but is compatible with the
intended vacated slip by the lease holder requesting a slip
change.
(b)
The requested vessel offers better maximization of the vacated
slip.
(c)
A mutual agreement has been established between two
slipholders for a swap.
(d)
(3)
§ 405-7 BARNSTABLE CODE § 405-8
404:1126
the application. Proof of the vessel's documentation or state registration
and the ownership or corporate status must be verified by the ship's papers
and the current ownership or corporate papers. Said papers must show the
ownership or corporate principals and percent of ownership and they will
remain on file. Any change in percent of ownership of the vessel must be
approved by the Town's Harbormaster after receipt of a recommendation
from the Town's Waterways Committee. Any unapproved change in percent
of ownership of the vessel shall be grounds for termination of the slip, and
the contract shall be deemed null and void with all fees forfeited. It shall
remain the prerogative of the Harbormaster to review these papers at any
time to insure compliance.
§ 405-9. Re-renting of vacated space for temporary use.
The owner or operator shall advise the Harbormaster/Dockmaster when
leaving for a cruise of one day or more. The Town may re-rent the space for
a temporary period during the absence of the craft regularly occupying the
space. No credit for such temporary use of space shall be granted the craft
regularly occupying the space.

MOORING
GENERAL REFERENCES
Beaches and waterways — See Ch. 32.
Boats — See Ch. 40.
Marinas — See Ch. 405.
§ 406-1. Purpose.
The Town of Barnstable mooring regulations have been established in order
to provide efficient utilization of harbor areas, to improve the safety of
moored vessels, and to provide adequate space for the enjoyment of all the
users of the harbors. This shall be done by controlling the placement of
moorings, establishing standards for mooring tackle, and by establishing
regular, systematic mooring inspections.
§ 406-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BOAT/VESSEL — Every description of watercraft, used or capable of being
used as a means of transportation on the water, including seaplanes,
amphibious vehicles, and any other variable use craft when navigating or
moored on the water.
BOW CHOCK — A rigging fitting on the bow of a vessel, normally mounted
on deck or in the toe rail, to control a rigging or mooring line.
MOORING — Semipermanent ground tackle placed by a vessel owner or
mooring servicer on or beneath (helix mooring) the bottom on behalf of a
vessel owner; a place where vessels are kept at anchor.
MOORING BUOY — A buoy marking a mooring.
MOORING PERMIT — Written authorization issued by the Harbormaster's
Office to moor a vessel.
A. INDIVIDUAL — Moorings placed for the private use of the vessel owner.
COMMERCIAL — Commercial moorings that are not for sale or rent but
used by a commercial establishment for the holding of boats for sale,
repair, or the like.
B.
RENTAL — Moorings installed for which any type of user fee is charged.
SEASONAL — Moorings offered for rent for periods exceeding
three weeks.

C.
§ 405-30 BARNSTABLE CODE § 406-2
404:1138
MOORING SERVICER — Person(s) licensed by the Harbormaster's Office to
perform mooring service, installation, inspection and maintenance services.

PENNANT — A line, cable, or chain by which a vessel is made fast to a
mooring buoy.
§ 406-3. Mooring specifications.
All moorings shall meet the minimum standards as set forth below prior
to placement. These standards are set for normal weather conditions. In
the event of gale winds or stronger and/or extreme tides, it is the mooring
owner's responsibility to ensure certain precautions are taken. The Town
of Barnstable realizes that mooring loads are variable, that it is impossible
to say that all boats of equal length require the same size mooring, and
such standards cannot be applied to all boats. The Harbormaster's Office
reserves the right to require a boat owner to increase the minimum mooring
standard for any vessel should it feel the minimum standard would be
inadequate for the vessel because of unusual design, such as, but not
limited to, excessive weight, windage, or draft. Furthermore, the Town of
Barnstable shall not be held liable for any damage inflicted if a minimum
standard mooring fails.
TRANSIENT — Moorings offered for rent for periods of up to three
weeks.

Aquaculture License Regulations
§ 407-46. Findings.
The Town of Barnstable advocates the orderly development of aquaculture
that is complementary to the continuing development of the Town's
shellfishery as it pertains to aquaculture licenses. In consideration of any
aquaculture license the Town is obligated to protect and preserve the
existing fisheries and to minimize the impact on other uses of the marine
environment. The right of public navigation through a license shall not
be infringed upon except in areas containing approved structures that
are properly marked according to these regulations. The size and scope
of the license shall co-exist with and not diminish the common property
commercial and recreational shellfisheries or other existing water-related
activities.
§ 407-47. Proof of residency required. [Amended 12-3-2016;
12-1-2018]

satisfaction of the licensing authority that they are a bona fide, principally
domiciled resident of the Town of Barnstable and have been principally
domiciled within the Town for at least 12 consecutive months prior to the
date of application. Two forms of written proof of residency are required;
tax bills paid by the applicant, rent receipts with accompanying lease
agreement, utility bills paid by the applicant, driver's license, car
registration issued to the applicant, etc., may serve as proof. All local tax
obligations must be paid in full in order for an application to be considered
in accordance with MGL c. 40, § 57, which was adopted by Town Meeting in
November 1986. Any licensed area so licensed subsequent to the adoption
of these rules and regulations shall be forfeited if the holder of the license,
herein referred to as the "licensee," ceases to be a bona fide, principally
domiciled resident in the Town of Barnstable. Annual documentation to
verify the licensee is principally domiciled in the Town of Barnstable is
required. This may be a current real estate tax bill, mortgage statement or
residential lease and copy of motor vehicle registration. (A driver's license is
not valid proof of domicile.) The burden of proof is on the licensee and shall
be included with the annual license fee, due by December 31 each year.

the licensed area or portion thereof is prohibited. Licenses are renewable,
heritable and transferable, subject to Town Manager written approval and
pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 130. Licenses are
transferable only after five years from the original license issuance date,
subject to review by the Natural Resource Office for reporting requirements
and production standards under §§ 407-59 and 407-60 and subject to the
Town Manager's written approval and pursuant to Massachusetts General
Laws Chapter 130. A licensee proposing to transfer his or her license shall
first notify the Town Manager in writing that he/she no longer wishes to
operate the license and requests a transfer of his/her licensed area to
a designated recipient. Such recipient shall thereupon file an application
under § 407-48. Thereafter, the application shall be treated, insofar as
apt, as a new application. If, however, the licensee is under any pending
investigations or violations, the license may not be transferred.
§ 407-55. Changes to original plans.
All proposed changes to the original working plans as described in the
original application, and all additions of material investments, which may

§ 407-56. New license period; renewal. [Amended 12-3-2016]
A new license shall be issued for a period not to exceed five years, and for
a total maximum area not to exceed two acres. The licensee may apply for
renewal of the license at any time within two years prior to the expiration
date of the license. The Town Manager shall review the licensee's request
for renewal within 60 days after receipt of the renewal request. Under the
legal discretion of the Town Manager, the license holder shall have the
option of a renewal period up to 10 years.
§ 407-57. Acreage limitation.
The maximum total acreage licensed to any licensee shall not exceed two
acres on the Northside and two acres on the Southside within the Town
of Barnstable inner bays. This acreage limitation does not apply to any
existing so-called grant (now referred to as a "license") which is in excess

other applicable regulations set forth herewith.
§ 407-58. License fee.
An annual license fee of $25 per acre or any part thereof shall be paid to the

product has been produced on the license during the preceding year, the
license may be forfeited. For purposes stated herein, "reasonable amount of
shellfish product" shall mean not less than $4,000 per acre per year based
upon market value. This amount is subject to change with inflation rates.
Failure of the licensed shellfish product to meet such a value shall result in
a forfeit of the shellfish aquaculture license and licensed area. If, for any
year, the licensee does not meet the reasonable production value, then upon
written request to the Town Manager, said reasonable production value may
be waived at the discretion of the Town Manager for that particular year,
provided that the licensee can demonstrate to the Town Manager that the
cause of the lower amount produced is the direct result of a natural disaster
or other unforeseen personal misfortune.

§ 701-1. Authority; goals.
Under the terms of the Conservation Commission Act, Conservation land
is received and held "in the name of the city or town." The Conservation
Commission has a clear authority under the Conservation Act to adopt rules
and regulations for the use of its land. The Town of Barnstable Conservation
Commission's goal in management of its property is to protect the values
of the land. The values are related to the protection or preservation of
biological and ecological diversity, water supply and water quality,
aesthetics and recreation, and community character. These values are
related to public health and safety and environmental protection. The
Commission is charged with balancing these values with public use and
accessibility. The Conservation Commission discourages the following land
use practices.
§ 701-2. Findings with respect to littering and illegal dumping.
Unfortunately there are people who find open space parcels a quick answer
to their unwillingness to drive to the solid waste station or pay the
necessary dumping fees. Illicit dumping is a large problem in West
Barnstable Conservation area. The Town's Public Works Division has
Violations of any provisions of Sandy Neck regulations may be punished
by a noncriminal fine not to exceed $300, and/or loss of beach
privileges. Criminal acts are subject to enforcement as allowed by
the Town of Barnstable Ordinances or the General Laws of the
Commonwealth.
A.
The provisions of these regulations may be enforced utilizing the
procedures contained in MGL c. 40, § 21D, as a noncriminal alternative.
B.
§ 601-11 ROLLER SKATES AND SKATEBOARDS § 701-2
408:1259
removed items, time and time again, such as sofas, chairs, mattresses, tires,
rugs, cardboard boxes and refrigerators. Other items dumped throughout
all the Conservation parcels include household trash, landscaping debris
and weekend party debris. Illicit dumping and littering impacts not only
public health and safety, but also aesthetics and community character.
§ 701-3. Findings with respect to unauthorized vehicle use.146
Illegal motorcycle and ATV use on Conservation parcels is on the rise. The
unauthorized motorcycles and ATVs race along the narrow winding paths
that the hikers, horseback riders and mountain bikers share. This raises a
public safety concern. Gates and other barricades are placed to discourage
unauthorized vehicle use, but the smaller vehicles continue to make new
paths around them. Many times gate locks are broken or even the large
steel gates themselves are cut or torn out of the ground allowing the larger
vehicles access. The Commission depends on the Town's Natural Resource
Officers to patrol; however the mere size of West Barnstable Conservation
Area, which boasts over 1,000 acres with 15 miles of trails makes this a
difficult task.
§ 701-4. Unauthorized use of firearms prohibited.
Unauthorized use of firearms on Conservation lands is clearly a public
safety issue. The Conservation Commission provides the public a
shooting range at the West Barnstable Conservation Area. The range
is managed by the Commission and policed and maintained by the
Natural Resource Division. A fee is charged for the permit and a key to
unlock the entrance gate. Hunting is allowed on certain Conservation
parcels so as long as the person follows the state and federal laws.
The discharge of a firearm, unrelated to the actual hunting of a game
species for any reason, including but not limited to, target practice and/
or the discharge of live ammunition is strictly prohibited on all property
managed by the Conservation Commission. The firing of blanks,
including the use of starter's pistols, is limited to property managed
by the Conservation Commission where hunting is allowed. [Amended
6-16-2015]
A.
No hunting is allowed in the following conservation areas:
Crocker Neck. (NOTE: The hunting of waterfowl is permitted below
the high tide mark in coastal waters.) [Amended 6-16-2015]

(2) Long Pond.
(3) Jenkins Wildlife Sanctuary.

§ 701-5. Open fires; camping; consumption of alcoholic beverages.
§ 701-6. Findings with respect to vandalism.
Vandalism is prevalent in most of the large Conservation parcels that
promote public access with parking areas, trails and signage. Only to
mention a few incidences: gates, barriers and fences have been cut or
even torn out of the ground. Large wooden Conservation signs removed
from a busy road side edge. Kiosks torn down and wood viewing decks
burned to the ground. Interpretive trail markers are torn out of the ground.
Replacement of these structures requires land management funds.
§ 701-7. Violations and penalties.
(6) Santuit River.
For public safety reasons, unpermitted fires are not allowed. Area Fire
Departments are called on an average to at least one or two fires a year
occurring on Conservation parcels that have been maliciously started.
Fire Departments reach many of these fires by using a brush breaker,
which also causes damage.
A.
For public health, safety and environmental reasons camping is
unpermitted on the lands. Public rest rooms are not available which
would be a public health issue and campsites can damage the
environment if not managed properly. Unpermitted camping can also
lead to unpermitted fires.
B.
Consumption of alcoholic beverages is not permitted on Conservation
property. This regulation is in conjunction with the Chapter 20, Article
I, Open Containers, of the Code of the Town of Barnstable. The
consumption of alcohol seems to be prevalent at Long Pond and Whelan
Conservation Areas in Marstons Mills and Crocker Neck Conservation
Area in Cotuit. Associated with underage drinking is unpermitted fires
and littering which are also public health, safety and environmental
issues.
C.
Pursuant to Town of Barnstable By-laws Chapter 1, Article I, and MGL
Chapter 40, § 21D, regarding the establishment of a noncriminal
disposition process for Conservation Commission land use violations,
the Commission does hereby promulgate the following regulation and
penalty schedule for its land management rules and regulations for
properties which the Commission both controls and directly manages:
Violation Fine
Littering $300.00
Illicit dumping $300.00
Unauthorized vehicle use (cars, trucks, ATVs and

by the Conservation Commission and a decision by the Commission
authorizing the reinstatement.
Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the General Ordinances of the
Code of the Town of Barnstable, explicitly protects the values of the
natural resources of its foreshores, intertidal areas and the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts' tidelands and waters as well as
inland wetlands, ponds and lakes.
A.
The purpose of these regulations is to establish performance standards
for private docks and piers. The authority for these regulations derives
from Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the General Ordinances of
the Code of the Town of Barnstable § 237-8. These regulations will not
B.
§ 702-3 ROLLER SKATES AND SKATEBOARDS § 703-1
408:1267
apply to freshwater docks unless the Commission specifically finds that
they are applicable.
The construction, use, and maintenance of docks, piers and walkways
are likely to have a significant or cumulative adverse effect on the
wetland resource values of storm damage prevention, fin and
shellfisheries, wildlife habitat, erosion and sediment control, and
recreation. Construction, maintenance and use of piers can have
adverse effects on resource areas and on the use of these areas for
recreational purposes. Further, piers destroyed by storm pose a threat
to nearby properties by increasing water-borne debris.
C.
Turbulence, such as caused by jet-drive boats, and propeller dredging
generated by boat use associated with piers significantly increase
turbidity levels. High turbidity levels attenuate light. Light is necessary
for photosynthetic process responsible for the primary productivity and
oxygen regeneration of the water. The suspended sediments settle on
shellfish beds, smothering existing shellfish and altering the quality of
the benthic environment essential for spat (mollusk larvae) settlement.
Resuspension of bottom sediments causes redistribution of sediments,
alteration in sediment grain size distribution and causes changes in
bottom topography relief, elevation and grade, including creation of
depressions in the bottom. Settlement of sediments into depressions
can create deep pockets of highly fluid-like sediment which may not
be able to physically support shellfish or which can become anoxic and
therefore not support shellfish. Disturbance of sediments during the
period of shellfish larval settlement hinders or prevents the effective
settlement of shellfish larvae. Boat traffic generated from piers will add
to this disruption and may cause erosion of banks and marshes.
D.
Construction of piers and subsequent boat activity causes resuspension
of nutrient-laden sediment particles which may cause a release of
sediment-bound nutrients to the water column resulting in a "bloom"
of vegetation. Release of nutrients to the water column leads to
eutrophication and anoxic bottom conditions. Anoxic sediments and
anoxic bottom conditions create adverse impacts on benthic resources,
including shellfish and fisheries.
E.
While pier construction is typically the least environmentally
destructive method of crossing a marsh, it may adversely affect the
physical characteristics and functional value of marsh. Marsh plants
provide the major energy flow (detritus food chain) between the
autotrophic and heterotrophic levels in a marsh-estuarine system.
Many species of sport and commercial fish and shellfish are dependent
upon this system. Plants adapted to high ambient light intensity, such
as marsh grasses, are ill-adapted to the shaded conditions created by
a pier. Shading may result in the loss of vegetation biomass (decreased
plant height, population density, and leaf thickness) or alteration of
species composition. Reduction in plant density results in the loss
of sediment normally trapped by roots and culms. Tidal washout of
sediment can result in localized depressions which, through

§ 703-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BOAT LIFT, DAVIT, or BOAT ELEVATOR — A mechanical or electrically
driven device attached to a dock, pier or bulkhead for raising and lowering a
vessel vertically (from one level to another), in and out of the water.[Added
2-20-2018]
DOCKS AND PIERS — The terms "dock" and "pier" shall be used
interchangeably for the purposes of these regulations and shall mean the
entire structure of any pier, wharf walkway, bulkhead, or float, and any part
thereof, including pilings, ramps, walkways, float, tie-off pilings, dolphins
and/or outhaul posts, that is located on a bank (inland) (310 CMR 10.54),
evaporation of trapped water, concentrate salt. High sediment salt
levels effectively preclude recolonization by original vegetation.
Localized tidal washout may lead to further vegetative regression,
erosion, and disruption of natural communities in the area.
Propeller turbulence near or in areas of submerged aquatic vegetation,
such as eel grass, or salt marsh damages vegetation, thereby increasing
the rate at which organic detritus is produced. If this organic detritus
does not completely decompose aerobically, then anoxic bottom
conditions will ensue, which adversely impact shellfish and fisheries.
G.
Cumulative impacts of the construction, maintenance and use of piers
threaten to decrease the overall productivity of the marsh ecosystem,
to reduce its ability to absorb storm wave energy, and to reduce its
contribution to groundwater and surface water quality. Cumulative
impacts also affect shellfish habitat and shell fishing.
H.
Docks and piers when placed in land containing shellfish or shellfish
habitat have an adverse impact on the resource area value of
recreation. The placement, length and size of docks and appurtenant
floats can interfere with the harvesting of quahogs, soft-shell clams,
and scallops. Docks and piers can have an unacceptable significant or
cumulative effect on habitat and recreation as defined in § 327-14 of
Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the General Ordinances of the
Code of the Town of Barnstable.
I.
Piers, depending on their length, can have an adverse impact on
recreation by interfering with recreational boating activities. Not
properly designed, piers can interfere with intertidal lateral access for
recreational fishing and fowling. Any proposal that affects navigation is
likely to have a significant or cumulative adverse effect on recreation.
Excessive lighting on piers may cause temporary "night blindness" in
boaters and may disrupt feeding habits of nocturnal aquatic animals.
J.
Docks conforming to the following regulations can be presumed to
minimize the aforementioned possible negative impacts.
K.
§ 703-1 ROLLER SKATES AND SKATEBOARDS § 703-2
408:1269
land under water bodies and waterways (310 CMR 10.56), land under
the ocean (310 CMR 10.25), land under a salt pond (310 CMR 10.33),
rocky intertidal shore (310 CMR 10.31), or that portion of a coastal beach
(310 CMR 10.27) seaward of the mean high water line. Notwithstanding
the above, either a swimming float or work float, kept at a mooring, that
receives a permit from the Harbormaster and is not connected with the
shore, is not a float subject to these regulations.
DRAFT — The maximum depth of a vessel as measured from the surface of
the water to the deepest part when loaded to the manufacturer's maximum
load specification. In vessels equipped with outboard or I/0 engines, draft
shall be measured with its propulsion unit in its lowest operating position.
IMPROVEMENT DREDGING — Any dredging under an order of conditions
from the Conservation Commission starting in 1973, or from other agencies
prior to 1973, in an area which has not previously been dredged or which
extends the original dredged width, depth, length or otherwise alters the
boundaries of a previously dredged area.[Added 2-20-2018]
LITTORAL PROCESSES — The movement of sediments, including gravel,
sand, or cobbles, along the shore caused by waves or currents.[Added
2-20-2018]
MAINTENANCE DREDGING — Dredging under an order of conditions in
any previously dredged area which does not extend, expand, or exceed
the originally dredged width, depth or length. However, such dredging
does not by its very nature include or mean improvement dredging or
backfilling.[Added 2-20-2018]
MEAN HIGH WATER (MHW) — The present arithmetic mean of water
heights observed at high tide over a specific 19-year metonic cycle
determined by using hydrographic survey data of the National Ocean
Survey and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
MEAN LOW WATER (MLW) — The arithmetic mean of water heights
observed at low tide over a specific 19-year metonic cycle determined by
using hydrographic survey data of the National Ocean Survey and the U.S.
Department of Commerce.
MEAN LOWER LOW WATER (MLLW) — The average of the lower low
water heights of each tidal day as established by the arithmetic mean
of water heights observed at low tide over a specific 19-year metonic
cycle determined by using hydrographic survey data of the National Ocean
Survey and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
NAVIGATION — The ability to traverse a waterway by watercraft.
PRIVATE PIER — A water-dependent structure accessory to a residential
use but shall also include Yacht Club, Association and community piers and
any other noncommercial, nongovernmental pier.
SEASONAL USE — The dock, ramp, floats and all supporting materials are
not in place in any wetland resource area prior to April 1 of each year and
are removed prior to November 1 of each year.
§ 703-2 BARNSTABLE CODE § 703-2
408:1270
SHELLFISH HABITAT — Areas below MHW that exhibit, or can be
demonstrated to have exhibited within a reasonable historical period,
characteristics including but not limited to sediment type, grain size,
circulation patterns, hydrologic regime, water chemistry, plant and algal
communities, food supply, and normal predation patterns necessary to
support shellfish species populations. A determination of shellfish habitat
can be based on the results of a site analysis and/or on current or historic
shellfish productivity, municipal shellfish population development
programs, or as shown on any maps or reports developed by the Marine
and Environmental Affairs Division filed with the Commission and the Town
Clerk (for example "The Significant Shellfish Resource and Habitat Area
Mapping Project for the Three Bay Area," dated August 21, 2000). Shellfish
relay areas are presumed to be good habitat. Absence of shellfish shall not
be solely determinative of the quality of shellfish habitat due to the cyclic
nature of shellfish population.
SPRING TIDES — The average height of the high waters of the spring
tides is called spring high water or mean high water springs (MHWS).
The "spring tide line" is defined as the annual average of the two monthly
lunar spring tides. This information can be obtained from the NOAA tide
tables.[Added 2-20-2018]

on the dock so as to be visible from seaward.
F.
Storage of floats, other seasonal pier material, and boats shall not be
allowed on marshes, dunes, or coastal banks. All such materials must
be stored in a permitted area and transported thereto without causing
damage to any resource area, or outside of conservation jurisdiction.
G.
Where the project includes the use of floats, the combined size of all
floats shall be consistent with the impact of the entire project on the
protected values at the site, but not greater than 200 square feet. A
minimum depth of 12 inches of water measured at MLW is required
under the floats.
H.
Plank spacing shall be a minimum of 3/4 inch. However, where any
portion of the dock (walkways, ramps, pier, etc) crosses a salt marsh,
a minimum of 65% light penetration is required. The maximum dock
width shall be 4 feet, measured center of pile to center of pile. For
single pile construction, maximum deck width shall be four feet.
I.
No dock, including pier, floats, dolphins, etc., shall extend further from
shore than:
A point equaling 1/2 of the lot's water frontage measured in a

channel or a channel as defined by historic use. This dimension
includes the beam of the vessel being berthed.
(2)
Is necessary to attain a depth of water at mean low water suitable
for a private use of the pier that is consistent with protection of
the wetland resources adjacent to the site and uses of the adjacent
waters and wetlands by the public in pursuit of the interests
protected under the Town of Barnstable Wetlands Protection
Ordinance, but under no circumstances greater than 100 feet from
mean low water, including all "ells" and "tees," regardless of
configuration.

The base of the pier shall be as close as possible to the center line of the
lot, and it shall project outwards at an angle as nearly perpendicular to
the shoreline as possible.
L.
Within the limits of performance standards governing overall length
of docks, the following depth requirements must be met for motorized
vessels, with these draft requirements continuing over time:
In areas determined to be of high-value shellfish habitat, the
minimum depth under the draft of the boat must be 30 inches at
MLW. High-value shellfish habitats are those found to be significant
to the provision or protection of the wetland values protected
under Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the General
Ordinances of the Code of the Town of Barnstable. Any area rated
six or above on any maps or reports developed by the Natural
Resources Division and filed with the Commission and the Town
Clerk shall be presumptively considered a high-value shellfish area.
(1)
In areas determined not to be high-value shellfish habitat, the
minimum depth under the draft of the boat must be 12 inches at
MLW.
(2)
For vessels using unconventional drive systems, such as but not
limited to jet-drives, the applicant, in addition to meeting the above
minimum depth requirements, must further demonstrate that the
water depth is adequate to protect the interests herein referenced.
(3)
To prevent bottom scouring, the above-described minimum depths
must exist not only at the dock where a boat(s) is to be berthed or
used but also between the dock and the nearest navigable channel
or open water.
(4)
M.
Notwithstanding any other provisions contained herein, no new or
expansion of an existing dock shall be permitted within an ACEC (area
of critical environmental concern).
N.
Private piers shall be constructed so as to not interfere with any
longstanding public recreational use of the waterway, e.g., an area
used by sailboats tacking through a narrow waterway, an area used
by boaters or others because of unique wind or current conditions, a

structure that would interfere with public access to or from a way to
water or public.
Where there is a substantial expansion of an existing dock, the
Commission may require compliance with all or part of these
regulations.
P.
Boat lifts, boat elevators and boat davits. [Added 2-6-2018]
Boat lifts, boat elevators and boat davits are prohibited for any
proposed new dock except where necessary for handicapped
access for a resident of the property where the dock is proposed.
Where there is no longer a demonstrated medical need, or when
the property is transferred or sold, the boat lift, elevator or davits
must be removed and the Conservation Division notified.
(1)
Boat lifts, boat elevators and boat davits are prohibited for any
existing, permitted dock except:
Where necessary for handicapped access for a resident of
the property where the dock is located. Where there is no
longer a demonstrated medical need, or when the property is
transferred or sold, the boat lift, elevator or davits must be
removed and the Conservation Division notified; or
(a)
Where extraordinary circumstances are proven to exist, such
as wind, tides, currents and boat wakes, and where the
commonly used alternatives of boat whips and dolphins/tie-off
piles are proven by the applicant as being unable to provide
stability for vessels berthed at the dock.
(b)
(2)
Boat lifting devices that qualify above in Subsection Q(1) or (2)
must comply with the following:
Be either mechanically operated or electrically driven. The use
of hydraulic fluid is prohibited.
(a)
(b) Be painted a neutral color or anodized.
Be elevated so that the hull of the vessel is no more than 12
inches above mean high water, except that greater heights
can be set for extreme tides, not to exceed the spring tide
line. Notwithstanding this provision, elevated vessels should
be removed during storm events. Due to extreme tidal range,
boat lifts, elevators and davits are prohibited in Barnstable
Harbor.
(c)
Have a specific vessel identified with its use, such vessel
having a neutral hull color and having either no bottom paint
or a nontoxic bottom paint. The applicant will provide bottom
paint specifications to staff for review.

Q.
R. Improvement dredging. [Added 2-6-2018]
§ 703-4 BARNSTABLE CODE § 703-4
408:1276
§ 703-5. Presumption of adverse effect; burden of proof; cumulative
impact.
Improvement dredging to create water depths to otherwise meet
the requirements of these regulations is prohibited. Improvement
dredging is not allowed to provide greater depths at a shallow site
that otherwise would qualify only for either a nonmotorized dinghy
dock or a small-draft motorized dock.
(1)
Improvement dredging to create greater water depths at the site of
an existing, permitted pier and/or in a fairway from the permitted
pier to the nearest channel is prohibited, except that a waiver may
be sought where accretion of subsurface sediments has occurred
as a result of either:
The littoral drift of sediments from nearby beaches, dunes and
banks that have been artificially nourished; or
(a)
The passage and repassage in the nearest channel of large
passenger/car/truck ferries or other large observation, freight
or tanker vessels.
(b)
(2)
Under either Subsection R(2)(a) or (b), improvement dredging is
allowed to restore the depths that existed at the time the dock was
permitted by the Commission.
(3)
When a proposed project involves the dredging, removing, filling,
altering or causing of a potentially adverse effect to an area subject
to protection under the ordinance by the construction or enlargement
of a dock, the Commission shall presume that the proposed activity
will have a significant or cumulative adverse effect upon the resource
values specified in Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the General
Ordinances of the Code of the Town of Barnstable. These presumptions
are rebuttable and may be overcome only by a preponderance of
evidence showing that the work does not have a significant or
cumulative adverse effect upon the resource values. The burden of
proof to overcome the presumption shall be borne by the applicant.
Moreover, the Commission will consider the impact of both existing
docks and future docks with pending applications in determining the
cumulative effects upon the protected resource areas. Where
appropriate, the applicant may be required to submit a drawing
showing all possible docks (docks that may meet Commission
guidelines) within 1/2 mile of the proposed dock or other agreed to
cumulative physical location. The cumulative impact of such docks and
the related boat use pattern on the values protected by the ordinance
will be considered by the Commission. A project which may otherwise
comply with these regulations and guidelines may be denied where its
cumulative effect would result in an adverse impact upon the protected
resource areas.

Introduction. The Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (MGL c. 131,
§ 40), its attendant regulations (310 CMR 10), and Chapter 237,
Wetlands Protection, of the Code of the Town of Barnstable were
promulgated to protect wetland resource areas and the values or
interests they serve. Moreover, the Town of Barnstable Zoning
Ordinance embraces several construction setbacks from wetlands (35
feet) and MHW in coastal areas and inland great ponds (50 feet).
By extending potential regulatory jurisdiction over proposed activity
within the resource areas themselves and also within a one-hundredfoot
buffer zone landward of such areas (when activity may elicit a
deleterious resource area impact), the foregoing statute, regulations
A.
§ 703-5 BARNSTABLE CODE § 704-0
408:1278
and ordinances provide the Conservation Commission with a
meaningful set of tools for protecting the long-term integrity of areas
under its jurisdiction.
Prevention of pollution.
The role that a protective buffer zone plays in the maintenance of
viable wetland resource areas has been frequently discussed in the
scientific literature. Omernik (1977) thoroughly documented the
dramatic increase in nitrogen and phosphorous loading to wetlands
and waterbodies as their adjacent watersheds are cleared. Water
quality, it was demonstrated, can be better maintained if protective
buffer strips are preserved along stream edges.
(1)
As surface runoff from developed sites flows toward a wetland
resource area, the buffer zone can provide a site where eroded
sediments settle, where nutrients from fertilizers are adsorbed
onto soil elements, and where transition zone vegetation can
uptake unbound nutrients preventing nuisance algal blooms in
adjacent waters (Harris and Gosselink, 1989).
(2)
Nutrients are by no means the only pollutant which may degrade
wetland resource areas. Surface runoff from developed sites
carries a diverse and potent pollution load: hydrocarbons, lawn
chemicals, metals, bacteria, and viruses are common constituents
(Diamond and Nilson, 1988). While it has been demonstrated that
wetlands can play an effective role in cleansing pollutant loads
(Nickerson, 1978), little is known of the assimilative capacity of
wetland systems in accommodating the broad spectrum of nonpoint
pollutants in a given watershed. Indeed, evidence of our swamping
of the natural thresholds for wetland resiliency abound.
(3)
B.
Wildlife. The transitional assemblage of trees, shrubs and ground cover
(containing both wetland and upland elements) frequently found in
buffer zones has been found significant to the support of a greater
number of native and specialist wildlife species in the interior of
resource areas which they border. Put another way, similar habitats
provide a gradual transition zone that is not as inhospitable as an
abrupt habitat "edge" (Harris, 1984b). It seems that the relationship
between the width of the transitional buffer zone along a bordering
marsh, for example, and the provision of optimum wildlife habitat for
its native marsh fauna is a proportional one. On the other hand, more
common edge species, including many opportunistic exotics and
generalists may find their habitat proportionately diminished.
C.
Cumulative effects. Cumulative effects are defined and discussed in
Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the Code of the Town of
Barnstable. Cumulative effects result from individually minor but
collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time
(Council on Environmental Quality, 1978). While Chapter 237 provides
that the Commission may deny any project that will have a significant
D.
§ 704-0 ROLLER SKATES AND SKATEBOARDS § 704-0
408:1279
cumulative effect on a wetland or its values, our permit-level activities
(i.e., site disturbance) are difficult to measure on the scale of
cumulative impacts (i.e., watersheds) (Gosselink and Lee, 1989). Thus,
techniques employed for individual permit review are not robust
enough to resolve potential significant cumulative impacts, even though
it may be clear that the collective impact of many such proposals
could adversely affect or imperil a wetland resource area. A reasonable
hedge against the cumulative impact is the ascription of a flanking
undisturbed buffer of suitable width.
Storm damage prevention/flood control.
The Town of Barnstable's 100 miles of coastline have long provided
an active interface for the power of the sea and the buffering
capacity of its coastal land forms (marshes, beaches, dunes and
banks).
(1)
The concern for continued efficacy of the foregoing resource areas
in buffering, storing, or containing floodwaters has recently been
elevated in the face of predictions for sea level rise in the next
century. Due to an increasingly warm atmosphere, a rise in mean
sea level of 20 cm to 40 cm has been predicted by the year 2100
(Oerlemans, 1989). However, other projections find mean sea level
will increase by 66 cm in the same period (Steward, 1989).
However, it is important to note that only the relative rate of
increase in sea level is being debated, not the tendency to
sustained increase in the centuries ahead. The effect of an
accelerated rise in sea level will be an appreciable acceleration in
coastal erosion processes and their notable manifestations: land
erosion, storm damage, flooding, and loss of coastal wetlands.
(2)
Additionally, impacts to coastal resource areas may be incurred
as a result of site development. Rill erosion of coastal banks and
sedimentation of salt marshes may result from lack of appropriate
drainage conveyance systems or erosion control practices for
surface flows. In the face of the scientific concern over the
acceleration of the rate of sea level rise, and so that upland-induced
impacts to coastal resource areas may be minimized, the imposition
of a flanking undisturbed buffer zone of suitable width is found both
advisable and necessary, respectively.
(3)
E.
How wide a buffer? The Massachusetts Audubon Society has
recommended the imposition of three-hundred-foot-wide natural
undisturbed buffers in those areas that directly abut critical resource
areas. Projects proposed for prohibition within the buffer zone include
both non-water-dependent activities (building construction, sewage
disposal systems) and water-dependent activities (bulkheads,
revetments) (Brady and Buchsbaum, 1989). Minimum buffer zone
widths as mandated by other northeast states for areas of critical
environmental concern range from 200 feet in Rhode Island to up to
300 feet in Maine, Maryland and New Jersey.
F.
§ 704-0 BARNSTABLE CODE § 704-0
408:1280
§ 704-1. Applicability.
Pursuant to the regulation of activity under Chapter 237, Wetlands
Protection, Code of Town of Barnstable, in the one-hundred-foot buffer zone
to resource areas (NOTE: For purposes of this regulation, land subject to
coastal storm flowage shall not be treated as a resource area.) listed in 310
CMR 10.02 (1)(a) and in Chapter 237, § 237-2, the following regulations
shall apply.
Conclusion. The Conservation Commission finds that the uniform
provision of an undisturbed buffer zone width of 50 feet will serve to
insulate wetland resource areas from adverse impacts stemming from
development elsewhere in the buffer zone. In cases where the slope of
an undisturbed buffer exceeds 18%, or in any instance where the scope
or nature of the project is likely to require a greater spatial offset to
wetland resource areas, the Commission reserves the right to increase
buffer zone width to a more suitable dimension.

§ 704-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
FIFTY-FOOT BUFFER ZONE — That area of land extending 50 feet
horizontally outward from the boundary of resources areas, whether or not
said buffer is in a disturbed or undisturbed/natural state.
FIFTY-TO-ONE-HUNDRED-FOOT BUFFER ZONE — That area of land
extending 50 feet horizontally outward from the boundary of the fifty-foot
buffer zone and terminating at the outer edge of the Commission's onehundred-
foot jurisdictional zone.
FIFTY-FOOT UNDISTURBED BUFFER ZONE — That area of land extending
50 feet horizontally outward from the boundary of resource areas. A fiftyfoot
undisturbed buffer zone consists entirely of unmanaged/unmaintained
vegetation or long-established meadow. All of the following are absent from
a fifty-foot undisturbed buffer zone: hardscape (except for permitted access
paths and/or bank access stairs), lawns, ornamental plants and shrubs,
gardens of any kind. This zone may be referred to herein as the "fifty-foot
undisturbed buffer."
HARDSCAPE — Any structure or other covering on or above the ground that
includes materials commonly used in building construction, such as wood,
asphalt and concrete, and also includes, but is not limited to, all structures,
decks and patios, sidewalks, landscape walls, and paving including gravel,
shell, pervious or impervious concrete and asphalt.
ONE-HUNDRED-FOOT BUFFER ZONE — That area of land extending 100
feet horizontally outward from the boundary of resource areas. The onehundred-
foot buffer zone is comprised of the fifty-foot buffer zone and
the fifty-to-one-hundred-foot buffer zone and constitutes the Conservation
Commission's one-hundred-foot jurisdictional zone.
WATER-DEPENDENT FACILITY — Any structure or works associated with
water-dependent industrial, maritime, recreational, educational, or
fisheries activities that must be located at or near the shoreline and within
the one-hundred-foot buffer zone. An activity is water-dependent if it is
dependent on the water as part of the intrinsic nature or function of the
operation. Examples of water-dependent facilities include ports, marinas,
community piers, public beaches, recreational areas and fisheries.
Residences, restaurants, restrooms and concession stands are not waterdependent.
§ 704-3. Performance standards for projects requiring notice of
intent.
A fifty-foot undisturbed buffer zone shall be retained between the
landward-most wetland resource areas and the limit of proposed site
disturbance.
A.
§ 704-2 BARNSTABLE CODE § 704-3
408:1282
§ 704-4. Required waiver of performance standards for projects
proposed in fifty-foot buffer.
Where a fifty-foot undisturbed buffer zone, as measured in accordance
with the definition of "fifty-foot undisturbed buffer zone" in § 704-2,
exists prior to the proposed work and is proposed to remain intact,
proposed work within the fifty-to-one-hundred-foot buffer zone shall not
require further buffer zone enhancement.
B.
Where a fifty-foot undisturbed buffer zone, as measured in accordance
with the definition of "fifty-foot undisturbed buffer zone" in § 704-2,
does not exist prior to the proposed work, any work proposed within
the one-hundred-foot. buffer zone shall be subject to mitigation planting
requirements intended to restore, in so far as possible, both the
dimensions of a fifty-foot undisturbed buffer and its vegetation. For
such work proposed within the fifty-to-one-hundred-foot zone, the
calculation of mitigation is set forth in Subsection D.
C.
Calculation of mitigation for work proposed within the fifty-to-onehundred-
foot buffer. The amount of mitigation planting required for
work proposed within the fifty-to-one-hundred-foot buffer zone shall be
determined by the following method:
Calculate area of proposed hardscape within the fifty-to-onehundred-
foot buffer zone;
(1)
Multiply the area found in Subsection D(1) by three to obtain the
area of required mitigation at a planting to disturbance ratio of 3:1.
(2)
In no case shall the total area of mitigation plantings required
be greater than that which is necessary to restore a fifty-foot
undisturbed buffer in its entirety.
(3)
D.
Location of mitigation planting. Mitigation planting location(s) shall
clearly be shown on the site plan. The plan shall also provide area
calculations for the amount of mitigation planting herein required, and
the amount of mitigation planting proposed.
E.
Best practices.
The Conservation Commission shall exercise a preference for
pervious surface types of hardscape.
(1)
Where possible and practical, proposed hardscape within the fiftyto-
one-hundred-foot buffer zone shall be located no closer than 10
feet from the landward limit of the fifty-foot buffer zone, so that
attendant construction, landscaping and maintenance activities
may proceed without impact to the fifty-foot buffer zone.
(2)
F.
Hardscape or landscape alteration proposed within the fifty-foot buffer,
(except as noted in § 704-6 below) shall require a full or partial waiver
of the performance standards found in § 704-3. The Conservation
A.
§ 704-3 ROLLER SKATES AND SKATEBOARDS § 704-4
408:1283
§ 704-5. Request for mitigation alternatives.
Commission shall have the discretion to grant a waiver should it find
that the overall project, when considered with its proposed mitigation,
will protect the wetland interests contained in Chapter 237. The waiver
shall specify the terms of acceptable mitigation in accordance with
Subsection B and either Subsection C or § 704-5 below. To the extent
feasible and practical, work should be avoided within the fifty-foot
buffer. Therefore, the granting of a waiver and acceptance of mitigation
for work performed within the fifty-foot buffer should be considered
only under exceptional, limited circumstances. In the absence of a
waiver, hardscape or landscape alteration proposed within the fifty-foot
buffer shall not be undertaken.
Calculation of mitigation under a waiver. The minimum amount of
mitigation planting required for a waiver of performance standards
(§ 704-3) shall be determined using the following formula:
Calculate area of disturbance from proposed hardscape and
landscape alterations within the fifty-foot buffer zone; and
(1)
Multiply the area found in Subsection B(1) by four to obtain the
area of required mitigation at a planting to disturbance ratio of 4:1.
(2)
B.
On-site mitigation under a waiver. When the required mitigation is
to be provided on site, mitigation planting location(s) shall clearly be
shown on the site plan. The plan shall also provide area calculations for
the amount of fifty-foot buffer zone altered, the amount of mitigation
planting herein required, and the amount of mitigation planting
proposed.
C.
Meadow restoration. Certain sites requiring mitigation planting may
be candidates for meadow restoration. By request of the applicant or
of its own accord, the Commission shall determine which sites are
appropriate for this mode of mitigation.
A.
Mitigation-constrained sites. Certain sites requiring mitigation may not,
from the perspective of the Commission, lend themselves to mitigation
planting or meadow restoration (in part or in full) because of their
landscape setting. For example an existing house close to the top of a
coastal bank may have limited space for an expanded buffer to mitigate
under this regulation. For such mitigation-constrained projects, the
Commission may, at the applicant's request, consider off-site mitigation
or in-lieu fees in order to achieve the required mitigation, as provided
in Subsection C and D below.
B.
Request to provide mitigation off site.
Request for off-site mitigation. For off-site mitigation to be
considered, the following preconditions must be satisfied:
(1)
C.
§ 704-4 BARNSTABLE CODE § 704-5
408:1284
The Commission must find that the project site is mitigationconstrained;
(a)
The applicant/representative must request in writing that the
Commission consider off-site mitigation for the project;
(b)
When off-site mitigation is proposed, the applicant/
representative must identify the proposed off-site mitigation
location and demonstrate the property owner's consent to use
of the property for this purpose and record an order of
conditions and certificate of compliance, or similar legally
binding restriction on the off-site mitigation property for this
purpose;
(c)
When off-site mitigation is proposed, the area of required
mitigation planting is calculated as set forth in § 704-3D for
work proposed within the fifty-to-one-hundred-foot buffer zone,
and as set forth in § 704-4B for work proposed within the fiftyfoot
buffer zone; and
(d)
The acceptance of off-site mitigation is at the sole discretion of
the Commission.
(e)
When the required mitigation is to be provided off site, mitigation
planting location(s) shall clearly be shown on a site plan. The plan
shall also provide area calculations for the amount of fifty-foot
buffer altered, the amount of mitigation planting herein required,
and the amount of mitigation planting proposed.
(2)
Request to pay fees in lieu of mitigation.
Request to pay fees in lieu of off-site mitigation. For payment
of fees in lieu of mitigation to be considered, the following
preconditions must be satisfied:
The Commission must find that the project site is mitigationconstrained.
(a)
The applicant/representative must request in writing that the
Commission consider payment of fees in lieu of mitigation for
the project.
(b)
(1)
In-lieu fees may be calculated as follows: multiply the total area
of required mitigation planting calculated for the project by $3.50
per square foot or in accordance with the current Conservation
Commission Fee Schedule.
(2)
In-lieu fees may be made payable to the Conservation
Commission's Hamblin Conservation Fund, dedicated exclusively
to the improvement of conservation land throughout Barnstable
and across a variety of habitats. Alternatively, in-lieu fees may be
made payable to the Town of Barnstable Conservation Fund, as
established by MGL c. 40A, § 8, or other suitable entity acceptable

§ 705-1. Definition.
A coastal bank is defined under Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the
General Ordinances of the Code of the Town of Barnstable as a seaward
face or elevated landform, other than a coastal dune, which resides at the
landward side of a coastal beach, land subject to tidal action, or other
coastal wetland. A coastal bank must have a slope greater than 18%
(compare Figures 1 and 3150). A coastal bank may serve as a vertical buffer
to floodwater, or as a sediment source.
§ 705-2. Comparison of DEP and Town policy.
Chapter 237 coastal bank policy loosely parallels DEP's bank policy (92-1),
but important differences exist.
§ 705-3. Methods for determining slope.
In contrast with DEP:
To be regulated, a coastal bank must have a slope greater than
18%. The toe of bank is that point where the slope first exceeds
18%. The top of bank is that point where the slope diminishes to
18% or less (Figures 3 and 4). Observe that the top of bank may
occur below (Figure 4) or above (Figure 3) the FEMA one-hundredyear
coastal floodplain.
(1)
A slope less than or equal to 18% is not a coastal bank under
Chapter 237, although it may be under DEP policy (Figure 1).
(2)
Under DEP policy, a coastal bank may arise anywhere the FEMA
one-hundred-year coastal floodplain occurs, as long as the slope
criteria are met. Thus, a DEP coastal bank may occur at a
seemingly "interior" location, removed from the shoreline itself, but
where the topography is low and the landscape prone to coastal
flooding. Under Chapter 237, a regulatable coastal bank must
necessarily reside adjacent to a tidal waterbody.
(3)
A.
In common with DEP:
Multiple or tiered coastal banks may reside at the same site (Figure
5).
(1)
A coastal bank may extend above the FEMA one-hundred-year
coastal floodplain only when the toe of bank is located below the
floodplain (Figure 3). That is, a bank originating beyond the FEMA
one-hundred-year coastal floodplain is presumed insignificant to
storm damage prevention and flood control interests, and is not
regulated (Figure 2).

ABUTTER NOTIFICATION
GENERAL REFERENCES
Wetlands protection — See Ch. 237.
§ 706-1. Request for determination of applicability (RDA), notice of
intent (NOI) and amended order (AO).
Slopes of potential coastal banks shall be determined by employing one
or more linear transects, depending on the bank's profile view:
Where the slope is relatively uniform (Figure 3), the transect shall
extend from the toe of bank to the FEMA one-hundred-year coastal
floodplain (or velocity zone, should no "A" zone be indicated). The
derived "run-up slope" must exceed 18% to qualify as regulatable.
(1)
Where the slope is variable (Figure 5), the transects shall be fitted
so that the steepest portions of the bank are analyzed. Employing a
single transect that includes both steep and gently sloping portions
of the bank would serve to "average" the run-up slope, and shall
not be considered appropriate.
(2)
A.
The top of coastal bank may be determined by either sighting the
first observable break in the greater than 18% slope, or by using the
transect method to quantify the point at which the slope diminishes to
18% or less.
B.
Observe that as this policy and methodology are independent of their
DEP counterparts, different "local" and "state" banks may exist at the
same site.
C.
Slopes which are clearly less than 18% shall require no demonstration
that they are not regulatable. Where slopes are clearly greater than
18%, a regulated coastal bank may simply be conceded by the applicant
without detailed analysis. Otherwise, slopes for notice of intent filings
shall typically be determined from field survey spot elevations. Transect
location(s) shall be shown in plan view, with spot elevations and runup
slope indicated. As a rule, deriving slopes through interpolated
contours shall not be an acceptable method. Neither shall the
"averaging" of a slope by the selection of too long a transect length.
D.
The Conservation Commission shall, however, reserve the right to find
the appropriateness of an applicant's particular delineation method on
a site-by-site basis. Moreover, where the application of this policy would
describe a regulatable bank which is truly insignificant in scope, the
Conservation Commission and/or its staff shall reserve the right to
decline any jurisdiction over it.

§ 708-1. Authority.
As provided by MGL c. 44, § 53G, the Barnstable Conservation Commission
may impose reasonable fees for the employment of outside consultants,
engaged by the Conservation Commission, for specific expert services
deemed necessary by the Commission to come to a final decision on an
application submitted to the Conservation Commission pursuant to the
requirements of the Wetlands Protection Act (MGL c. 131, § 40), Chapter
237 of the General Ordinances, the Conservation Commission Act (MGL c.
40, § 8C), or any other state or municipal statute, bylaw or regulation, as
they may be amended or enacted from time to time. It is the intention of the
Commission to use this authority judiciously, generally limited to complex
technical matters as those of substantial impact to the Town of Barnstable.
§ 707-2 BARNSTABLE CODE § 708-2
708:1296
§ 708-2. Deposit and disposition of funds.
Funds received by the Conservation Commission pursuant to these rules
shall be deposited with the Town of Barnstable Treasurer, who shall
establish a special account for this purpose. Expenditures from this special
account may be made at the direction of the Conservation Commission
without further appropriation as provided in GL Ch. 44 § 53G. Expenditures
from this account shall be made only in connection with the review of
specific project or projects for which a consultant fee has been collected
from the applicant. Unexpended funds, if any, will be returned to the
applicant at the conclusion of the proceedings.
§ 708-3. Consultant services; selection of consultant.
Specific consultant services may include but are not limited to resource
area survey and delineation, analysis of impacts on protected resources,
areas, values and functions, hydrogeologic and drainage analysis, impacts
on municipal conservation lands, and environmental or land use law. The
consultant shall be chosen by, and report only to, the Commission and/or its
Administrator.
§ 708-4. Notice of selection.
The Conservation Commission shall give written notice to the applicant of
the selection of an outside consultant, which notice shall state the identity
of the consultant, the amount of the fee to be charged to the applicant,
and a request for payment of said fee in its entirety. Such notice shall be
deemed to have been given on the date it is sent by certified mail or hand
delivered. No such costs or expenses shall be incurred by the applicant if
the application or request is withdrawn within five days of the date notice is
given.
§ 708-5. Payment of required fee.
The fee must be received in its entirety prior to the initiation of consulting
services. The Commission may request additional consultant fees if
necessary review requires a larger expenditure than originally anticipated
or new information requires additional consultant services. Failure by the
applicant to pay the consultant fee specified by the Commission within 10
business days of the request for payment shall be cause for the Commission
to determine the application is administratively incomplete (except in the
case of an appeal). The Commission shall state such in a letter to the
applicant, copied to the DEP. No additional review or action shall be taken
on the permit request until the applicant has paid the requested fee. Failure
by the applicant to pay the consultant fee specified by the Commission
within 10 business days of the request for payment shall be cause for the
Commission to deny the permit application.
§ 708-2 OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS § 708-6
708:1297
§ 708-6. Appeals; consultant qualifications.
The applicant may appeal the selection of the outside consultant to the
Barnstable Town Council, who may disqualify the outside consultant
selected only on the grounds that the consultant has a conflict of interest
or does not possess the minimum required qualifications. The minimum
qualifications shall consist of either an educational degree or three or more
years of practice in the field at issue or a related field. Such an appeal must
be in writing and received by the Town Council, and a copy received by the
Conservation Commission, so as to be received within ten (10) days of the
date consultant fees were requested by the Conservation Commission. The
required time limits for action upon the application shall be extended by the
duration of the administrative appeal.

Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the General Ordinances of the
Code of the Town of Barnstable, explicitly protects the values of the
natural resources of its foreshores, intertidal areas and the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts' tidelands and waters as well as
inland wetlands, ponds and lakes.
A.
§ 710-1 BARNSTABLE CODE § 711-1
709:1300
The purpose of these regulations is to establish performance standards
for shore outhauls. The authority for these regulations derives from
Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the General Ordinances of the
Code of the Town of Barnstable, § 237-8.
B.
The construction, use, and maintenance of shore outhauls are likely to
have a significant or cumulative adverse effect on the wetland resource
values of storm damage prevention, fin and shellfisheries, wildlife
habitat, erosion and sediment control, and recreation. Construction and
use of shore outhauls can have adverse effects on resource areas and
on the use of these areas for recreational purposes. Further, shore
outhauls destroyed by storms pose a threat to nearby properties by
increasing waterborne debris.
C.
Turbulence, such as caused by jet-drive boats, and propeller dredging
generated by boat use with shore outhauls significantly increase
turbidity levels. High turbidity levels attenuate light. Light is necessary
for the photosynthetic process responsible for the primary productivity
and oxygen regeneration of the water. The suspended sediments settle
on shellfish beds, smothering existing shellfish and altering the quality
of the benthic environment essential for spat (mollusk larvae)
settlement. Resuspension of bottom sediments causes redistribution of
sediments, alteration in sediment grain size distribution and causes
changes in bottom topography relief, elevation and grade, induding
creation of depressions in the bottom. Settlement of sediments into
depressions can create deep pockets of highly fluid-like sediment which
may not be able to physically support shellfish or which can become
anoxic and therefore not support shellfish. Disturbance of sediments
during the period of shellfish larval settlement hinders or prevents
the effective settlement of shellfish larvae. Boat traffic generated from
shore outhauls will add to this disruption and may cause erosion of
banks and marshes.
D.
Construction of shore outhauls and subsequent boat activity causes
resuspension of nutrient-laden sediment particles which may cause a
release of sediment-bound nutrients to the water column resulting in a
"bloom" of vegetation. Release of nutrients to the water column leads
to eutrophication and anoxic bottom conditions. Anoxic sediments and
anoxic bottom conditions create adverse impacts on benthic resources,
including shellfish and fisheries.
E.
Propeller turbulence near or in areas of submerged aquatic vegetation,
such as eel grass, or salt marsh damages vegetation, thereby increasing
the rate at which organic detritus is produced. If this organic detritus
does not completely decompose aerobically, then anoxic bottom
conditions will ensue, which adversely impact shellfish and fisheries.
F.
Cumulative impacts of the construction and use of shore outhauls
threaten to decrease the overall productivity of the marsh ecosystem,
to reduce its ability to absorb storm wave energy, and to reduce its
G.
§ 711-1 NONCRIMINAL DISPOSITION OF WETLANDS § 711-1
709:1301
§ 711-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DRAFT — The maximum depth of a vessel as measured from the surface of
the water to the deepest part when loaded to the manufacturer's maximum
load specification. In vessels equipped with outboard or I/O engines, draft
shall be measured with its propulsion unit in its lowest operating position.
MEAN HIGH WATER (MHW) — The present arithmetic mean of water
heights observed at high tide over a specific nineteen-year metonic cycle
determined by using hydrographic survey data of the National Ocean
Survey and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
MEAN LOWER LOW WATER (MLLW) — The average of the lower low
water heights of each tidal day as established by the arithmetic mean of
water heights observed at low tide over a specific nineteen-year metonic
cycle determined by using hydrographic survey data of the National Ocean
Survey and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
MEAN LOW WATER (MLW) — The arithmetic mean of water heights
observed at low tide over a specific nineteen-year metonic cycle determined
by using hydrographic survey data of the National Ocean Survey and the
U.S. Department of Commerce.
contribution to groundwater and surface water quality. Cumulative
impacts also affect shellfish habitat and shell fishing.
Shore outhauls, when placed in land containing shellfish or shellfish
habitat, have an adverse impact on the resource area value of
recreation. The placement of shore outhauls can interfere with the
harvesting of quahogs, soft shell clams, oysters, and scallops. Shore
outhauls can have an unacceptable significant or cumulative effect on
habitat and recreation as defined in § 237-13 of Chapter 237, Wetlands
Protection, of the General Ordinances of the Code of the Town of
Barnstable.
H.
Shore outhauls, depending on their length (distance from shore of
their seaward piling), can have an adverse impact on recreation by
interfering with recreational boating activities. Shore outhauls can
interfere with intertidal lateral access for recreational fishing and
fowling. Any proposal that affects navigation is likely to have a
significant or cumulative adverse effect on recreation. The crowding
or clustering of several outhauls on one parcel may exacerbate the
adverse impacts to recreation.
I.
Shore outhauls conforming to the following regulations can be
presumed to minimize the aforementioned possible negative impacts.
J.
All shore outhauls in Barnstable shall be governed by these regulations,
whether accessory to residential use or serving commercial, yacht club,
association, community, Town or other purpose.
K.
§ 711-1 BARNSTABLE CODE § 711-2
709:1302
MOTORBOAT — Any vessel propelled by machinery, whether or not such
machinery is the principal source of propulsion (M.G.L. c. 90B, § 1).
NAVIGATION — The ability to traverse a waterway by watercraft.
PIER OUTHAULS — Pier outhauls are similar to shore outhauls but are
connected in some way to a pier. Pier outhauls are subject to a different set
of regulations (Ch. 703, Private Docks and Piers).
SEASONAL USE — The securing and retrieval system of the shore outhaul,
including the line and seaward piling, is not in place prior to April 1 of each
year and is removed prior to November 1 of each year.
SHELLFISH HABITAT — Areas below MHW that exhibit, or can be
demonstrated to have exhibited within a reasonable historical period,
characteristics. including but not limited to sediment type, grain size,
circulation patterns, hydrologic regime, water chemistry, plant and algal
communities, food supply, and normal predation patterns necessary to
support shellfish species populations. A determination of shellfish habitat
can be based on the results of a site analysis and/or on current or historic
shellfish productivity, municipal shellfish population development
programs, or as shown on any maps or reports developed by the Marine
and Environmental Affairs Division filed with the Commission and the Town
Clerk (for example, the "Significant Shellfish Resource and Habitat Area
Mapping Project for the Three Bay Area," dated August 21, 2000). Shellfish
relay areas are presumed to be good habitat. Absence of shellfish shall not
be solely determinative of the quality of shellfish habitat due to the cyclic
nature of shellfish population.
SHORE OUTHAUL — The entire structure of any boat securing and
retrieval system by which a boat is secured to a line connecting a piling
located in the water, and a post or similar structure on or near the shore.
The shore outhaul system enables the craft to be retrieved for boarding or
loading, and returned for securing following use.
§ 711-3. Application requirements.
Forms to be used to seek approval for new or existing shore outhauls:
A Notice of Intent (NOI) is required for any new or existing shore
outhaul on which a motorboat or any registered vessel is to be
secured. All NOI applications shall satisfy the filing protocols as set
forth in Subsections B through G below.
(1)
A Request for Determination of Applicability (RDA) is required
for any new or existing shore outhaul on which exclusively
nonmotorized (and nonregistered) boats are to be secured, or
where the application seeks approval based on conditions that
satisfy the grandfathering criteria as set forth below under
Subsection A(4). Commission Guidelines for Filing an RDA
Application shall be followed. Sketch plans are allowed. A copy
of the RDA application shall be mailed (first-class postage) to the
Harbor Master and, if the shore outhaul is to be located in salt

water, to the Shellfish Biologist. Their address is 1189 Phinney's
Lane, Centerville, Massachusetts 02632.
Where an RDA has been filed, the Commission may determine
that an NOI is necessary for any outhaul that is located in a high
value shellfish habitat, or in a shellfish relay area, or where in its
opinion the greater detail provided in the NOI filing requirements
is necessary to aid the Commission in making its decision.
(3)
Grandfathering. An existing shore outhaul may be considered
grandfathered only when it qualifies under one of the following
Subsections A(4)(a) or (b).
A Chapter 91 license has been issued by the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts prior to the adoption of these regulations
by the Conservation Commission. Notwithstanding any prior
Chapter 91 approval of a currently existing shore outhaul, an
appropriate application for continued use must be filed with
the Commission using the RDA permitting process described
above.
(a)
Grandfathering may also be extended for existing shore
outhauls, provided that the applicant submits the following
information under either Subsection A(4)(b)[1] or [2] below:
Written proof of local approval granted prior to the
construction and initial deployment of the shore outhaul
and prior to the adoption of Chapter 711 by the
Conservation Commission. The local approval shall have
been granted by a Town authority such as the Board of
Selectmen or Town Council, Town Manager, Building
Commissioner, Conservation Commission or other Town
authority deemed appropriate by the Commission. Proof of
the above prior approval shall be in the form of a specific
permit, such as a building permit, bearing the date and
signature of the issuing authority, or published minutes
from a public meeting of a Town Board, or a signed letter
from a Town authority on official letterhead or other proof
as may be deemed acceptable by the Conservation
Commission. Following Commission approval of an
appropriate application under the RDA permitting process
described above, the local permit holder must apply for
and receive a Chapter 91 license from the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection.

Upon submission of evidence, which the Commission
deems satisfactory, that an existing shore outhaul or
outhauls were in existence prior to January 1, 1973, the
effective date of wetlands protection permitting in the
Town of Barnstable. This evidence shall include an
affidavit, signed under the pains and penalties of perjury,

documenting that the construction and initial deployment
of a shore outhaul or outhauls, as in the case of a
community or association beach, occurred prior to that
date and has been continuously maintained since that
date. The Conservation Commission may require
additional information, including, but not limited to, dated
photographs, vessel history, and other documentation that
are reasonably necessary for it to make its determination.
Following Commission approval of an appropriate
application under the RDA permitting process as
described above, the local permit holder must apply for
and receive a Chapter 91 license from the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection.
For all existing shore outhauls (including those to be permitted as
being grandfathered) the deadline for application shall be no later
than October 1, 2010. Upon request, the Conservation Commission
or its staff may extend the deadline.

of the adjacent waters and wetlands by the public in pursuit of
the interests protected under the Town of Barnstable Wetlands
Protection Ordinance,151 but not greater than 50 feet from mean
low water.
Notwithstanding any other provision pertaining to length, no shore
outhaul shall be longer than is necessary to attain the minimum depths
required herein, and may not obstruct waterways or foreshores
normally used for recreation.
F.
The shore outhaul shall be as close as possible to the center line of the
lot, and it shall project outwards at an angle as nearly perpendicular to
the shoreline as possible.
G.
Within the limits of performance standards governing overall length
of shore outhauls, the following depth requirements must be met for
motorized vessels, with these draft requirements continuing over time:
In areas determined to be of high-value shellfish habitat, the
minimum depth under the draft of the boat must be 30 inches at
MLW. High-value shellfish habitats are those found to be significant
to the provision or protection of the wetland values protected
under Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the General
Ordinances of the Code of the Town of Barnstable. Any area rated
six or above on any maps or reports developed by the Natural
Resources Division and filed with the Commission and the Town
Clerk shall be presumptively considered a high-value shellfish area.
(1)
In areas determined not to be high-value shellfish habitat, the
minimum depth under the draft of the boat must be 12 inches at
MLW.
(2)
For vessels using unconventional drive systems, such as but not
limited to jet-drives, the applicant, in addition to meeting the above
minimum depth requirements, must further demonstrate that the
water depth is adequate to protect the interests herein referenced.
(3)
To prevent bottom scouring, the above-described minimum depths
must exist not only at the shore outhaul where a boat is to be
secured but also between the shore outhaul and the nearest
navigable channel or open water. When secured to the retrieval
system, the boat shall be kept at the seaward piling.

H.
Notwithstanding any other provisions contained herein, no shore
outhaul shall be permitted within an ACEC (area of critical
environmental concern).

impact.
by boaters or others because of unique wind or current conditions, a
structure that would interfere with public access to or from a way-towater.
All shore outhauls shall be seasonal, as defined under § 711-2, and pile
dimensions shall not exceed four inches by four inches.
K.
Motorboats shall not be operated until minimum permitted depths are
reached.
L.
A permit holder who knowingly violates the regulations listed in § 711-4
or fails to meet the general and special conditions listed in the Order
of Conditions, or the special conditions listed in the Determination of
Applicability, may be subject to enforcement action by the Conservation
Commission, including, but not limited to, temporary or permanent
revocation of the shore outhaul permit if deemed appropriate by the
Conservation Commission at the conclusion of a public hearing.
M.
When a proposed project involves the dredging, removing, filling,
altering or causing of a potentially adverse effect to an area subject to
protection under the ordinance by the construction of a shore outhaul,
the Commission shall presume that the proposed activity will have
a significant or cumulative adverse effect upon the resource values
specified in Chapter 237, Wetlands Protection, of the General
Ordinances of the Code of the Town of Barnstable. These presumptions
are rebuttable and may be overcome only by a preponderance of
evidence showing that the work does not have a significant or
cumulative adverse effect upon the resource values. The burden of
proof to overcome the presumption shall be borne by the applicant.
Moreover, the Commission will consider the impact of both existing
and future shore outhauls with pending applications in determining
the cumulative effects upon the protected resource areas. Where
appropriate, the applicant may be required to submit a drawing
showing all possible shore outhauls that may meet Commission
guidelines within 1/2 mile of the proposed shore outhaul or other
agreed to cumulative physical location. The cumulative impact of such
shore outhauls and the related boat use pattern on the values protected
by the ordinance will be considered by the Commission. A project which
may otherwise comply with these regulations and guidelines may be
denied where its cumulative effect would result in an adverse impact
upon the protected resource areas.
A.
These regulations notwithstanding, the Conservation Commission will
consider any and all shore outhaul proposals on a site-specific basis,
disposing of each according to its merit and to the degree that the
preponderance of evidence shall show that the statutory interests have
been preserved and protected.

building sites without injury to the public health, and include such
specific findings and reasons therefor in such report, and, where
possible, shall make recommendations for the adjustment thereof;
provided, however, that if a municipal sewerage system will service
the proposed subdivision, then failure of the Board to make such a
report within 45 days after the plan is filed with their office shall
be deemed approval by such Board or officer. Such Health Board or
Officer shall send a copy of such report, if any, to the person who
submitted such plan.

The streets shall be designed and located so as, in the opinion of
the Board, to be continuous and in alignment with existing streets;
to provide adequate access to all lots in the subdivision; by streets
that are safe and convenient for travel; to lessen congestion in
such streets and adjacent public streets; to reduce danger from the
operation of motor vehicles; to secure safety in case of fire, flood,
panic and other emergency; to insure compliance with applicable
Zoning Ordinance; to secure adequate provision for proper
drainage and water, sewers and other utilities; and to coordinate
the streets in the subdivision with each other and with the existing
street system of the Town, and the streets in neighboring
subdivisions.

Subdivisions shall be designed so as to minimize the length of
roads.
(7)
Road layouts shall be located and designed so as to create easily
accessed lots at or near grade level.
(8)
Subdivisions shall be designed so as to avoid creating lots with
double frontage, except when one frontage is on a major street.
(9)
Where a subdivision borders on a major street, access to lots shall
be provided from a parallel local street and access to the major
road shall be minimized.
(10)
No road, with or without fill, shall be located within a velocity
zone or within the one-hundred-year floodplain, as shown on the
special Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and as further defined by the
topographic information shown on the plan.
(11)
Where access to a subdivision crosses land in another municipality,
the Board may require certification, from appropriate authorities,
that such access is in accordance with the Master Plan and
subdivision requirements of such municipality and that a legally
adequate performance bond has been duly posted or that such
access is adequately improved to handle prospective traffic.
(12)
Width, alignment and grades of streets.
The criteria contained in the Appendix, Design Standards, Typical
Road Cross Section, and Guard Rail Warrant, shall be observed in
the design of streets. 168

right angles. No street shall intersect any other street at less than
75°.
(3)
Where the angle of intersection between two streets varies more
than 10° from a right angle, the radius of the curve at the curbline
at the obtuse angle shall be less and at the acute angle shall be
correspondingly greater than the radius specified in the Appendix
to the extent approved or required by the Board.
(4)
All changes in grade exceeding 2% shall be connected by vertical
curves of the length indicated in the design standards table in these
regulations.
(5)
No center-line gradient is to exceed 6% on any curve except when
the curve is superelevated and the design is acceptable to the
Board's engineer. All curves on a major road shall be superelevated

from the intersection with a street providing alternative access, to
the beginning of the cul-de-sac or turnaround T. The Board may
grant a waiver from the maximum length of the dead-end street if
the Board determines that there is a reasonable expectation that
the street will become an additional means of access or egress
to a future street connection on adjacent, undeveloped land. No
extension of a cul-de-sac or turnaround T to adjacent land shall
be permitted where such extension will lengthen a dead-end street
beyond the seven-hundred-fifty-foot maximum length.
(1)
Minor and secondary dead-end residential streets shall be provided
at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside paved
roadway diameter of 90 feet and a right-of-way diameter of 105
feet.
(2)
No major dead-end street and secondary nonresidential dead-end
street shall be permitted, unless the Fire Department, DPW, and/
or Police Department provide the Board with written determination
that there will be no compromise to public safety of both pedestrian
and vehicular traffic. Where the Board grants a waiver to allow a
dead-end street, the street shall be provided at the closed end with
a turnaround having an outside paved roadway diameter of not less
than 94 feet, 30 feet of the pavement width on the cul-de-sac and
with a right-of-way diameter of at least 110 feet. culs-de-sac shall
be shaped in accordance with ASHTO standards for circular and
circular offset culs-de-sac for single-unit trucks.

turnaround. Damaged areas shall be replanted with a combination
of ground cover, shrubs and/or trees common to the Cape such
as: bearberry, bayberry, inkberry, American holly, beach grape;
Rugosa rose, beach gum, red cedar, juniper, red oak, thornless
honey locust, American red maple, checkerberry, Shore juniper or
sargent juniper, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board.
(6)
Upon construction of an extension of a dead-end street, the
easement for the existing turnaround shall terminate in accordance
with the provisions of Chapter 41 of the General Laws. The paved
surface of the turnaround shall be removed so as to create a
roadway of a uniform width. Drainage, road surface and road
shoulders shall be repaired and/or reconstructed and revegetated
in accordance with all the requirements of the Subdivision Rules
and Regulations.
(7)
Clearance above roads. Overhanging vegetation shall be cleared to a
height of 15 feet above roads, to provide clearance for trucks including
Fire Department ladder trucks.
D.
General provisions.
The subdivision shall be designed so that all drainage shall be
contained and disposed of within the subdivision; no drainage shall
be discharged on to adjoining property or on to the public right-ofway
at a rate greater than existed prior to the construction of the
subdivision. The applicant shall submit information as to pre- and
post-development runoff volumes and peak flows during the tenyear
and one-hundred-year storm. No drainage shall be discharged
directly into any wetland or surface water body, or into any drain,
ditch, culvert or retention pond that leads into wetlands or surface
water bodies.
(1)
All drainage systems within the subdivision shall be designed in
accordance with the soil conservation service method or an
alternative system acceptable to the Board's engineer. Calculations
shall be made from the source of drainage runoff using topographic
maps for the entire drainage area, including those areas outside
the subdivision. Copies of all drainage calculations shall be
submitted with the definitive plan. Percolation tests may be
required at the discretion of the Board.
(2)
A.
§ 801-26 BARNSTABLE CODE § 801-27
801:1350
Drainage systems shall be designed and installed so as to prevent
stormwater runoff from becoming a hazard or a nuisance to the
subdivision residents or the public at large. The applicant is
ultimately responsible for the adequacy of the drainage system in
reaching this end. Should the system not adequately achieve the
goal, the applicant shall make whatever modifications are needed
to ensure that the drainage system performs adequately in the
opinion of the Planning Board. All modifications shall be acceptable
to the Board's engineer.
(3)
Subsurface drains or subdrains.
In areas where the finished grade of the roadway is less than four
feet above the water table or in areas where less than four feet of
fill is placed above water in swampy places or any standing water,
or in other areas, where in the opinion of the Board the subgrade
must be drained, a system of subdrains shall be designed for such
areas. The subdrain shall consist of a minimum of one longitudinal
drain for each forty-foot width of roadway or fraction thereof.
(1)
In addition, laterals shall be required as directed by the Board
in areas in which an undue amount of water could accumulate in
the subgrade. The system of subdrains shall be discharged into
the storm drainage system or otherwise disposed of in a manner
satisfactory to the Board.
(2)
Subdrains shall also be required where test borings show an
impervious layer of soil above a permeable layer of soil which is
located at or above one foot below the proposed basement floor
elevation.
(3)
B.
Storm drains.
A complete storm drain system shall be designed for each street
of the subdivision and, to the satisfaction of the Board, shall be so
laid out to provide adequate drainage of all portions of the street
system so that water does not accumulate thereon, to intercept
stormwater runoff from the adjacent lots of the subdivision, and
to eliminate undesirable or unnatural accumulation of water on
any portion of the subdivision or surrounding property. Those
conditions which result from a ten-, twenty-five- or fifty-year storm
as required shall be assumed as a basis for design of the street
drains. The storm drain system shall include gutters, catch basins,
manholes, culverts, drain lines, headwalls, vegetated swales,
detention ponds and such other items as may be required to
complete the system to the satisfaction of the Board. Information
regarding a procedure which may be utilized in drainage designs is
available from the Town Engineering office.
(1)
The Soil Conservation Service drainage calculation methodology
or an alternative systematic method acceptable to the Board's
engineer shall be used in the design of the drainage systems.
(2)
C.
§ 801-27 SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS § 801-27
801:1351
Best management practices (BMPs) shall be utilized to treat the
first one inch of rainfall, or 1/2 inch of runoff, whichever is greater.
BMPs shall consist of grass-lined swales, grass-lined retention
basins, or other treatment facilities acceptable to the Board's
engineer.
(3)
Side slopes on BMPs shall not be steeper than four to one and
generally should be much flatter. BMPs shall be distributed
throughout a subdivision and not concentrated in any one location
to better dilute the effects of any pollutants left untreated. For
this reason, the use of swales in areas with relatively level terrain
is desirable. The bottom of the BMPs should be four feet above
the probable high groundwater. All BMPs shall be located within
drainage easements or the road right-of-way.
(4)
Catch basins shall be located in pairs, one on each side of the
roadway, at all low points or sag curves in the roadway, at intervals
of not more than 300 feet on continuous grades of the roadway, and
at or near the corners of the roadway at intersecting streets.
(5)
Manholes shall be located at all changes in direction, either
horizontally or vertically, of a drain line or at the intersection of
two or more drain lines, or so located that no drain line greater
than 300 feet in length would exist without either a catch basin or
manhole.
(6)
Culverts shall be designed on the assumption that the entire
drainage area is built up to that density and in the manner which
the applicable section of the Zoning Ordinance169 allows. The
calculations (or a copy thereof) necessary to determine the size of
any culvert which carries a brook, stream, river or other natural
waterway shall be submitted to the Board for review. All culverts
shall have a headwall at each end, and any culvert over 36 inches
in diameter shall include at the upstream end additional protection,
as approved by the Board, for the roadway side slopes.
(7)
All drains shall be a minimum of 12 inches in diameter and shall
be laid on a slope of not less than 1/2 of 1%. The minimum design
velocity shall be three feet per second and maximum design
velocity shall be 10 feet per second. If the system is designed as
a self-cleaning system, the Board may accept a lesser minimum
slope for the drain lines. Pipe shall have a capacity 25% greater
than required by the calculations. In such cases as it is deemed
necessary and acceptable by the Board and its engineer, surface
water may be disposed of by a leaching system of the proper size
and design. Calculations for the design of such system shall be
submitted with other drainage calculations for the subdivision and
under the same provisions. Provision shall be made for the disposal
of surface water intercepted or collected by the system in such

a manner that no flow is conducted over Town ways, or over the
land of others unless a drainage easement is obtained or unless
such flow, in essentially the same quantity, previously existed in
the same location. Where adjacent property is not subdivided,
provision shall be made for extensions of the system by continuing
appropriate drains to the boundary of the subdivision at such size
and grade as will allow their proper projection.
All recharge systems shall be designed with a fail-safe feature
which will provide a safe, legal off-the-road overflow area for the
runoff in the event that the catch basins overflow. The overflow
areas shall be sized to accommodate a one-hundred-year storm.
The overflow areas shall preferably be located in naturally
vegetated shallow kettle holes or other depressions; however, if
there are not any naturally occurring areas, then the shallow areas
with gently sloping sides shall be excavated for stormwater
storage. Overflow areas shall be located within drainage
easements. Separate drainage lots are discouraged and will not be
permitted without the permission of the Planning Board.
(9)
A headwall shall be provided at the outfall end of all drains where
required.
(10)
All recharge infiltration type drainage systems shall be designed
by the applicant's engineer to prevent stormwater from breaking
out of any slopes. Breakout calculations shall be provided by the
applicant's engineer.
(11)
Easements for utilities. Easements for utilities shall be provided and
recorded as required and centered on lot lines where practical.
A.
Stormwater and drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed
by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, the Board may

erosion control devices may need to be installed for the duration of the
construction.
A.
The form and design of the controls will vary with the type of area
that is to be protected and the anticipated cause of the environmental
degradation. In most situations the type and location of controls can
be determined during the design phase; however, field conditions may
require a reevaluation of the controls needed during construction.
B.
Erosion control methods must be submitted to the Department of Public
Works for review and approval.
