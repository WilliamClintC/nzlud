102.9.2 – Curfew [Note: Conflicts with 102.9.1]
1. Short title. This section shall be known and may be cited as the Curfew Ordinance.
2. Purposes and findings. This is an updating of the Town of Thomaston Ordinance
prescribing, in accordance with prevailing community standards, regulations for the
conduct of minors on streets at night, effectively enforced, taught in the homes,
internalized and adhered to for generations, all for the good of minors, for the
furtherance of family responsibility, and for the public good, safety and welfare.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 1, Government & Organization 6/17/2019
Chapter 1 – Page 12
a. Thomaston Board of Selectmen finds that the curfew meets a very real local need,
has been over the years a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency and
should be updated and amplified in the light of the Town of Thomaston's local
situation and facts including the following:
b. This community sense of the proper time for cessation of outdoor activities by
minors on the streets is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this ordinance
which takes into consideration also the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for
accumulations of minors with potential risks incident to ammaturity.
c. Commercial recreational facilities for juveniles are almost nonexistent and there is
little or nothing for minors to do outdoors, but roam the streets, after the curfew
hours which this ordinance declares.
d. Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm, legal sanctions to
enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness over the years, as
parental control increases likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases and there is a
continuing need for the nocturnal curfew for minors which has achieved and will
continue to achieve under local conditions the purposes hereinbefore stated.
3. Definitions. For the purposes of the Curfew Ordinance the following terms, phrases,
words and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein.
When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the
future, words in the plural number include the singular and words in the singular
number include the plural. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not merely
directory.
a. Town is the Town of Thomaston, Knox County, Maine
b. Minor is any person under the age of 18, or, in equivalent phrasing often employed,
any person 17 or less years of age.
c. Parent is any person having legal custody of a minor
i. as a natural or adoptive parent,
ii. as a legal guardian,
iii. as a person who stands in loco parentis or
iv. as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of court.
d. Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets,
including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four or more
persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or
serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. To implement that thought
with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly
defined in section 5 so that this is not a mere prohibitory or presence type curfew
ordinance. More and more exceptions become available with increasing years and
advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is
intended by use of the meaningful phrase "be or remain" found constitutional in
Baker v. Borough of Steelton, 17 Dauph. 17 (1912), a decision properly classified in
Thistlewood v. Trial Magistrate for Ocean City 236 Md. 548, 204 A. 2d 688, 691 (1964)
as relating to a curfew ordinance of the "remaining" type.
e. Street is a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public as a
matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof
for pedestrian travel. The term street includes the legal right of way, including but
not limited to the cartway or traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks whether paved or
6/17/2019 Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 1, Government & Organization
Chapter 1 – Page 13
unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right of way of
a street. The term street applies irrespective of what it be called or formally named,
whether alley, avenue, court, road or otherwise.
f. Time of night referred to herein is based upon the prevailing standard of time,
whether Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time, generally observed at that
hour by the public in the Town, prima facie the time then observed in the
Thomaston Town Hall and police station.
g. Year of age continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth to (but not
including the day of) the next, such as the eighteenth birthday, making it clear that
17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years of
age." the latter phrase in practice, unfortunately, having confused a number of
persons into the mistaken thought that 18 year olds might be involved. Similarly, for
example, 11 or less years of age means "under 12 years of age."
4. Curfew for minors. It shall be unlawful for any person 17, or less years of age (under 18) to be
or remain in or upon the streets within the Town of Thomaston at night during the period ending
at 6 A. M. and beginning
a. at 10 P.M. for minors 11 or less years of age,
b. at 10:30 P.M. for minors 12 or 13 years of age, and
c. at 11 P.M. for minors 14 or more years of age.
5. Exceptions. In the following exceptional cases a minor on a Town street during the
nocturnal hours for which Subsection 4, above, is intended to provide the maximum
limits of regulation (and a clear general guide for minors, their parents and their fellow
citizens) shall not, however be considered in violation of the Curfew Ordinance.
a. When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
b. When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take said
parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and
purpose within a specific area.
c. When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the Unites States
Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of
assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by first
delivering, to communications center personnel, at the Town Hall, where and by
whom high priority messages to the Town Manager are regularly received, a written
communication, signed by such minor and countersigned if practicable by a parent
of such minor with their home address and telephone number, addressed to the
Town Manager, specifying when, where and in what manner said minor will be on
the streets at night (during hours when the Curfew Ordinance is otherwise
applicable to said minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in
such communication.
d. In case of reasonable necessity but only after such minor's parent has communicated
to the Town Police Station personnel the facts establishing such reasonable necessity
relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose including
points of origin and destination. A copy of such communication, or of the police
record thereof, duly certified by the Chief of Police to be correct, with an appropriate
notation of the time it was received and of the names and address of such parent
and minor, shall be admissible evidence.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 1, Government & Organization 6/17/2019
Chapter 1 – Page 14
e. When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides, or on the
sidewalk of either next door neighbor not communicating an objection to the police
officer.
f. When returning home, by a direct route from (and within 30 minutes of the
termination of) a school activity, or an activity of a religious or other voluntary
association, of which prior notice, indicating the place and probable time of
termination, has been given in writing to, and duly filed for immediate reference by,
the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the police station, thus
encouraging (here as in other exceptional situations) conduct on the part of minors
involved in such activities and striking a fair balance for any somewhat conflicting
interests.
g. When authorized by special permit from the Town Manager, carried on the person
of the minor thus authorized, as follows: When necessary nighttime activities of a
minor, may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this ordinance, then
recourse may be had to the Town Manager, either for a regulation as provided in
subsection (h) or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant. Upon the Town
Manager's finding of necessity for the use of the streets to the extent warranted by a
written application (as judicially approved in People v. Walton, 70 Cal. App.2d
Supp. 862,161, P. 2d 498, 502, 503, 1945), signed by a minor and by a parent of such
minor if feasible stating (a) the name, age and address of such minor, (b) the name,
address and telephone number of a parent thereof, (c) the height, weight, sex, color
of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of such minor, (d) the necessity
which requires such minor to remain upon the streets during the curfew hours
otherwise applicable, and (e) the street or route and the beginning and ending of the
period of time involved by date and hour, the Town Manager may grant a permit in
writing for the use by such minor of such streets at such hours as may be necessary.
In an emergency this may be handled by telephone, or other effective
communication, with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously,
either to the Town Manager or if unavailable to the police officer authorized by the
Town Manager to act on his behalf in an emergency, at the police station.
h. When authorized by regulation issued by the Town Manager in other similar cases
of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to normal or necessary nighttime
activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special
permit basis. Normally such regulation by the Town Manager on permitting use of
the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity
through news media and through other agencies such as the school, and shall define
the activity, the scope of the use of the streets permitted, the period of time involved
but to extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity,
and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is
consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this Curfew Ordinance.
i. When the minor carries a certified card of employment, renewable each calendar
month when the current facts so warrant, dated or re-issued not more than 45 days
previously, signed by the Chief of Police and briefly identifying the minor, the
address of his home and of his place of employment, and his hours of employment.
j. When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This contemplates
normal travel. From excess of caution, this clearly exempts bona fide interstate
6/17/2019 Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 1, Government & Organization
Chapter 1 – Page 15
movement through Thomaston, particularly on normal routes such as Route #1,
Beechwood, Wadsworth, Knox, High streets and Old County Road. This also
exempts interstate travel beginning or ending in Rockland.
k. Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations such as provisions for
notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided but here reemphasized; and
additional, also severable, exceptions, broadening with the progress toward maturity
of minors enrolled respectively in elementary, junior high and high schools, will be
considered by the board as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views
of student government associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, and
neighborhood spokesmen, parents, officers in authority concerned positively with
minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.
6. Parental responsibility. It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a
minor knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow, such minor to be or
remain upon town street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or
otherwise beyond the scope of the Curfew Ordinance. The term "knowingly" includes
knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the
whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep
neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense that a parent
was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor.
7. Police procedures. A policeman of the Town, upon finding or having attention called
to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of the Curfew Ordinance, normally
shall take the minor to the Town Police office where a parent shall immediately be
notified to come for such minor, whereupon they shall be interrogated. This is intended
to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to
centralize responsibility in the officer there and then on duty for accurate, effective, fair
impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making available experienced
supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access to information and records.
In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a policeman on the
street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in determining age.
a. Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may
provide, inter alia, that the policemen may deliver to a parent thereof a minor under
appropriate circumstances, for example a minor of tender age near home whose
identity and address may readily be ascertained or are known.
b. In any event such policeman shall within 24 hours file a written report with the
Chief of Police, or shall participate to the extent of the information for which he is
responsible in the preparation by himself and the officer involved in such case, and
in the filing, of such report within 24 hours.
c. When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the minor and the
appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be released to the
custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or fails to take charge of the
minor, then the minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the
extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile
authorities, the minor may temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other
person who will on behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the
minor pending the availability or arrival of a parent.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 1, Government & Organization 6/17/2019
Chapter 1 – Page 16
d. In the case of a first violation by a minor the Chief of Police shall by certified mail,
send to a parent written notice of said violation with a warning that any subsequent
violation will result in full enforcement of the Curfew Ordinance, including
enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties.
8. Penalties. Prevailing community standards, and the real internalization thereof or
interpersonal sanctions therefore that in practice count for much, as to when minors
should be off the streets, reflected in this Curfew Ordinance, are hereby undergirded
with the following legal sanctions.
a. If, after the warning notice pursuant to section 7 of a first violation by a minor, a
parent violates section 6 (in connection with a second violation by said minor), this
shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For such first parental offense a
parent shall be fined $25.00 and for each subsequent offense by a parent the fine shall be
increased by an additional $25.00, e.g. $50.00 for the second, $75.00 for the third offense. The
Sixth District Court, upon finding a parent guilty, shall sentence the parent to pay
such fine and the costs of prosecution, and upon refusal to pay such fine and costs
to be imprisoned in the jail of Knox County for a period not exceeding ten days.
b. Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of the Curfew Ordinance more
than three times shall be reported by the Town Manager to a society or organization
whose purpose it is to take charge of incorrigibles and delinquents and proceedings
shall then be taken, before the juvenile court for the treatment, supervision and
rehabilitation of such minor.
c. A like procedure, before the juvenile authorities, shall be followed in any case where
the imposing of a fine or fines upon a parent shall not be effective, or where for any
other reason the provisions of the Curfew Ordinance cannot be made effective by
the imposing of penalties under this Subsection 8.
9. Construction. Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of the
Curfew Ordinance. If any provision, including inter alia any exception, part, phrase or
term, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the
application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and the
validity of the Curfew Ordinance in any and all other respects shall not be affected
thereby. From excess of caution, the Town Manager is authorized to give advisory
opinions, in writing or immediately reduced to writing, which shall be binding, and
shall be adhered to by the police, until the ordinance is amended in such respect,
interpreting terms, phrases, parts or any provisions. Normally such advisory opinions
shall be in response to good faith, signed letters addressed to him at Watts Block
questioning as (a) ambiguous, (b) as having a potentially chilling effect on
constitutional rights specifically invoked, or (c) as otherwise invalid, in all three
categories with respect to proposed conduct definitely described. This administrative
remedy must be exhausted prior to presenting to any court a question in any of said
three categories. The Town Board of Selectmen does not intend a result that is absurd,
impossible of execution or unreasonable. It is intended that the Curfew Ordinance be
held inapplicable in such cases, if any where its application should be unconstitutional.
A constitutional construction is intended and shall be given. The Town Board of
Selectmen does not intend to violate the Constitution of the State of Maine or the
Constitution of the United States of America.

Chapter 1 – Page 17
10. Continuing evaluation. The Town Board of Selectmen will continue its evaluation
and updating of the Curfew Ordinance.
a. Accordingly, there shall be compiled and informally reported to the Town Board of
Selectmen through effective channels (such as the normal monthly distribution by
the Town Manager and Town Clerk, to each Selectman, the Town Manager and the
Town Clerk) all exceptional cases hereunder of reasonable necessity, the notices of
school and other activities, the Town Manager's special permits and the Town
Manager's regulations hereinbefore authorized, and the Town Manager's advisory
opinions, for consideration by the appropriate committee and by the Town Board of
Selectmen in further updating and continuing evaluation of the Curfew Ordinance.
b. For the same reasons, as well as for the implementation beyond these legal aspects of
the basic purposes hereof, the Town Manager and relevant committees of the Town
Board of Selectmen through their respective chairmen in coordinated efforts shall
work with existing, and may organize, voluntary groups, and shall stimulate
volunteer leadership, in programs of research and of action dealing constructively
on neighborhood and local bases, with juvenile delinquency, and the prevention,
control or containment thereof, in all its ramifications and with practicable steps
toward the good life, and a better life, for minors 17 or less years of age, and with the
working of the Curfew Ordinance, community-wise and in individual cases, as one
much needed legal tool toward that end as well as for continuing present protection
of minors, and of other persons, and of property and other interests, important to
the welfare of the people of the Town of Thomaston.

CHAPTER 4
THOMASTON HARBOR ORDINANCE
ARTICLE I - Adoption
Section 40l - General
401.1 - Purpose
Pursuant to the provisions of the Maine Revised Statutes Annotated (MRSA), Title 38,
Sec. 2, the following Ordinance is hereby enacted. It is intended that these will provide
the means by which use of Thomaston Harbor and its tidal waters may be maximized,
and competing commercial, recreational and other appropriate uses balanced. The
intent of this Ordinance is to insure that all legitimate interests will have the
opportunity to utilize Thomaston's limited harbor and tidal water resources.
401.2 - Characteristics
Thomaston Harbor, which is defined in detail in Chapter 10, Definitions, is situated
upriver from the bend in the St. George River when approaching the Town of
Thomaston from seaward. The harbor is comprised of a narrow channel at low tide
which measures 19.3 acres between the fixed beacon and the Wadsworth Street Bridge.
At normal high water, the water surface measures 96.9 acres. During northerly winds
the harbor is sheltered. During southerly to southwest winds, the harbor is sheltered
from the Wadsworth Street Bridge to the vicinity of Brown's point. Southeast winds
provide the only direction from which wind and waves create a problem for a majority
of the harbor. During incoming tides, the average current is 2-3 knots. During outgoing
tides, the current averages 3-4 knots. A current of 6 knots has been measured. Presently
the harbor sees maximum activity in the spring from April through June when boats are
launched, and in the fall during September and October when boats are hauled.
Considerable year-round activity results from productive clam flats on the St. George
River. The Town public landing float can accommodate 7 foot draft vessels at mean
low water. Lyman Morse Boatbuilding, located at either end of the harbor, has
extensive facilities for their service customers. A small boat marina and outboard
engine sales/service business, Jeff's Marine, is located at the western end of the
harbor. While there is virtually no safe anchoring space in the harbor, a visitor
mooring at the public landing is available.
401.3 - Standards
401.3.1 - Speed of Vessels: It shall be unlawful for any person to operate any boat
upon the St. George River, in the defined harbor in such a manner as to cause a
wash, a wake or waves that disturb or damage any wharf, float or anchored or
moored boat or vessel or at a speed that endangers any person or property. Vessels
shall not exceed a speed of five miles an hour in this area.
401.3.2 Navigation: The channel is for the passage of boats and shall be clear of any
and all obstructions, except as permitted below. No obstructions of any kind shall be
placed in the clear passage zone. Any person placing or owning an obstruction as
follows in the areas as defined in Chapter 10, Channel, and Chapter 10, Clear
Passage Zone, will be liable for a fine not exceeding $500 each day that any person
shall be found in violation of any said provisions. Each day shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense.
A.) No person shall set fishing equipment in the waters of the Town of Thomaston or
permit his equipment to remain in a position in said waters where any portion of said
equipment shall be within eight feet of the surface of the waters within the area
described in Chapter 10, Channel.
B.) No mooring shall be set, established or maintained within, Thomaston Tidal Waters, as
defined in Chapter 10, Definitions, without permission of the Harbor Master or his deputy
who shall grant such permission with due regard for passage of vessels. No person
shall anchor in said area except when in distress or under direction of the Harbor
Master.
C.) No water skiing or swimming is permitted in the harbor.

of the Harbor Landing area.
401.3.3 - Anchorage
Vessels shall anchor in the harbor in such a way and in such places or areas as the
Harbor Master shall direct. The Harbor Master may at any time order any vessel at
anchor to change position when, in his opinion, said vessel is so anchored as to
impede navigation or to endanger other vessels.

of their residence or in Thomaston. All vessels, whether documented or state registered, are liable
for payment of excise tax in the State of Maine if proof of payment elsewhere is not provided.
401.3.5 - Floats
A.) It is recognized that “floats” in the harbor will allow for a greater density of boats in
any given area, therefore, seasonal “floats” (less than 7 months per year) may be
moored in Thomaston Harbor on a space available basis as assigned by the Harbor
master and permitted by ACOE. All year-round (more than 7 month) floats installed in
Thomaston Harbor, must obtain permits from the Harbor Master, ACOE and Maine
DEP.

float space to individuals whose moorings have been displaced by placement of a given
float. Within space available, future requests for a moored float location shall be treated
on a first come basis and with no distinction made to residency in accordance with the
following priority guidelines:
i. Shore-front owners requesting an initial location adjacent to their
property, where practicable.
ii. Commercial vessel owners and marine operators.
iii. Pleasure vessel owners.
iv. Commercial vessel owners and marine operators requesting multiple
locations.
v. All others.
D.) The floats shall be privately owned, built, and maintained. Floats shall be built to
the standards listed in 401.4.2. Individuals who construct floats and are granted space
shall have the right to use of the floats assigned space consistent with this ordinance. If
these individuals change the size of their vessel they will go to a priority status and be
re-assigned a space for their vessel when available. Float space other than those
attached to a pier or wharf cannot be transferred in the event of ownership change,
either of the vessel or the float.
E.) Two-point tackle is required for all mid-channel mooring floats, with the moorings
size calculated based upon the length of the float plus 10’ when referred to table 401.4.4.
For example, a 15’ float would require two 4000# granite sinkers.

CHAPTER 5 - ODOR ORDINANCE
ARTICLE I - ODOR NUISANCE CONTROL AND
ABATEMENT
Section 501 - Purpose
The purpose of this Ordinance is to assure the comfort, convenience, safety, health and welfare of the people
of the Town of Thomaston, to protect the environment, to promote the development of an economically
sound and stable community, and to provide for the prevention, control, and abatement of public odor
nuisance.
The Town of Thomaston finds and concludes that because most odorous pollutants have a complex chemical
composition and may elict a broad spectrum of response by the receptors, special methods must be employed
in their measurement and characterization. Although analytical data are more precise and may be useful in
identifying a source, it is the human response or the sensory data that is most critical in determining the
necessary degree of odor control. Analytical data may be used to specify permissible emission levels from a
source, but sensory date must be employed to assess the impact in the surrounding community. The latter is
the Town's primary concern.
Section 502 - Authority and Administration
502.1 - Authority
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to Title 30-A, ss2101 through 2109 (Home Rule); Title 30-A, ss3001-3010
(Ordinance Authority and Limitations); Title 17 Sections 2702, 2705 and 2706 (Nuisances) and common law.
502.2 - Administration and Enforcement
The Code Enforcement Officer of the Town of Thomaston shall administer and enforce this Ordinance.
Section 503 - Prohibited Activities
503.1 - Cause or allow the emission of odorous air emissions from any source such as to result in objectional
odors at the lot line of the source; or,
503.2 - Cause the erection, continuance or use of any building or place for the exercise of a trade,
employment or manufacture which, by noxious exhalations, offensive smells or other annoyance, become
injurious and dangerous to the health, comfort or property of individuals, or of the public and creates a public
nuisance as defined by 17 MRSA Section 2701; or
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 5, Odor Ordinance
Chapter 5 – Page 2
503.3 - Do any process, rendering, or operate or use any device, machine, equipment, or other contrivance
for the rendering of animal or marine matter unless all gases, vapors and gas entrailed effluents from these
processes are controlled in such a manner as to effectively abate any objectionable odor by utilizing the best
available control technology.
Section 504 - Objectionable Odor Determination
An odor will be deemed objectionable and is a public nuisance when any of the following occurs:
504.1 - Creates a public nuisance at common law: or,
504.2 - The erection, continuance or use of any building or place for the exercise of a trade, employment or
manufacture which, by noxious exhalations or offensive smells become injurious and dangerous to the health,
comfort or property of individuals, or to the public, or
504.3 - All the members of a panel consisting of the Code Enforcement Officer and three residents of the
Town of Thomaston appointed by the Manager to assist the Code Enforcement Officer to investigate
complaints and who are not directly affected or interested by the source determine following concurrent,
personal observation, that the odor at the property line of the source based on Town Tax Maps or elsewhere
in the town is objectionable taking into account its nature, concentration, location, and duration and are able
to identify the source; or,
504.4 - On or adjacent residential, recreational, institutional, retail sales, hotel or educational premises when
odor detectable after it is diluted with four volumes of odor-free air as measured by the use of dynamicolfactometry
provided for in Franz, J.J. and Prokop, W.H. "Odor Measurement by Dynamic Olfactometry",
Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association, Vol. 30, No. 12: 1228-1297, December 1980 which is
incorporated herein by reference.
504.5 - Samples for the source are taken and found to rate from a panel provided for in Section V (c) a
response of over 2.0 in terms of butanol olfactometry scale steps as determined by the method developed by
Sweeten et al (A Butanol Olfactometer for Field Measurement of Ambient Odors", Sweeten, J.M. McFarland,
A.R., Sorel, J.E., Gauntt, R.O., and Reddell, D.L., Journal Air Polution Control Association, Vol. 34: 208-213,
1984) which is incorporated herein by reference and which is an adaption of ASTM E 544-75 (re-approved
1981) which is incorporated herein by reference.
Section 505 - Observation and Measurement Procedure
505.1 - For the purpose of this ordinance, two odor observations and/or measurements shall be made within
a period of one hour, these measurements being separated by at least fifteen (15) minutes.
505.2 - Odor observation and/or measurements shall be taken to arrive at a determination that an
objectional odor exists shall be at or beyond the property line or at or near places where people live or work.
Section 506 - Abatement of Objectional Odors
The Code Enforcement Officer or any court may order the abatement of objectionable odors by ordering:
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 5, Odor Ordinance
Chapter 5 – Page 3
506.1 - Any person who operates or uses any device, machine, equipment causing objectionable odors or
other contrivance for the rendering of animal matter to provide that all gases, vapors and gas entrailed
effluents from such facility are incinerated at a temperature of not less than 1200 degrees Fahrenheit for a
period not less that 0.3 seconds, or processed by condensation or such manner which will provide the best
available control technology, eliminating the offensive odors.
506.2 - Any person incinerating or processing gas, vapor, or gas entrailed effluents causing objectionable
odors to provide, properly install, and maintain in good working order and in operation, devices to monitor
temperature, pressure, or other operating conditions, eliminating the objectionable odors.
506.3 - Effective new or existing odor control devices, systems, or measures be installed and operated such
that no vent, exhaust pipe, blowoff pipe, or opening of any kind shall discharge into the ambient air any
odorous matter, vaper, gases, or dust, or any combination thereof, which create objectional odors.
506.4 - Materials producing objectionable odors to be stored, transported, and handled in such a manner
that:
506.4.1 - Odors produced from materials are confined, abated or treated using the best available control
technology and that accumulation of such materials resulting from spillage or other escape is prevented,
eliminating objectionable odors.
506.4.2 - Whenever dust, fumes, gases, mist, odorous matter, vapers, or any contamination thereof escapes
from a building used for rendering animal or marine matter in such a manner and amount as to cause an
objectional odor, the Code Enforcement Officer or court may require that the building or buildings in which
rendering, handling, and storage are done be tightly closed and ventilated in such a manner that all airborne
effluent materials leaving the building be treated by an effective means using the best available control
technology to treat odorous matter before release to the ambient air, eliminating objectionable odors.
Section 507 - Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
When determining compliance to any of the terms of this Ordinance, the town may take whatever acts are

lot size area, lot width or shore frontage shall be obtained only by action of the Board of
Appeals.
b) If two or more contiguous lots are in the same ownership of record at the time of or since adoption
or amendment of this Ordinance, and if any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional
requirements of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments, and if one or more of the lots are vacant
or contain no principal structure, the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet the
dimensional requirements. No division of the parcel shall be made that creates any dimension or
area below the requirements of this Ordinance, and if any such lot is created after enactment of this
Ordinance or any amendment thereof, that lot shall not be built upon. If, after combining all contiguous
lots in the same ownership, the parcel fails to meet dimensional standards of this Ordinance,
said parcel may be built upon in accordance with paragraph 703.3.1a.
703.3.2 Lots with Structures
a) A single lot of record that is the site of a principal building or use, may have additional structures
built in accordance with paragraph 703.3.1a.
b) If two or more contiguous lots are in the same ownership, and if all or part of the lots do not meet
the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, and a principal building or use exists on each lot,
may have additional structures built accordance with paragraph 703.3.1a.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
7
c) If two or more contiguous lots are in the same ownership, and if all or part of the lots do not meet
the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, and the lots are the site of permitted accessory
buildings or uses, the lots may be built upon in accordance with paragraph 703.3.1b.
703.4 Non-conforming Structures
703.4.1 Maintenance and Enlargement
A structure in existence on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, which does
not meet the setback, height, or lot-coverage standards of this Ordinance, may be repaired, maintained
and improved. It may be enlarged and/or accessory structures may be added to the lot without a variance
provided that:
a) the enlargement or accessory structure does not exceed the height standards of the District in
which it is located; and
b) that the enlargement or accessory structures(s), in combination with the existing structures(s), does
not exceed the lot-coverage standards of the District in which it is located; and
c) that the enlargement or accessory structure(s) meet the setback standards of the District, or, if not
possible and located with the same yard area as the principal non-conforming structure, is no closer
than the closest portion of the existing accessory non-conforming structure, or of the principal nonconforming
structure if there is no existing accessory structure, to the front, side or rear lot line and
contains no more than an additional twenty-five (25) percent of the ground-floor area of the existing
accessory non-conforming structure or twenty-five (25) percent of the ground floor area of the principal
structure if there is no existing accessory structure. In no case shall this section be construed to
allow an existing non-conforming structure to become more non-conforming by enlargement or replacement.
Within the Resource Protection District or the Shoreland District, no portion of a structure that is less
than the required setback from the normal high-water line (NHWL) of a water body, or tributary
stream or the upland edge of a wetland, shall be expanded, as measured in floor area or volume, by
30% or more, during the lifetime of the structure. If a replacement structure conforms with the requirements
of 703.4.2 Reconstruction, and is less than the required setback from a water body, tributary
stream or wetland, the replacement structure may not be expanded if the original structure existing on
January l, 1989 had been expanded by 30% in floor area and volume since that date.
Whenever a new, enlarged or replacement foundation is constructed under a non-conforming structure,
the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the
greatest practical extent as determined by the Board of Appeals or its designee, basing its decision on
the criteria specified in section 703.4.3, Relocation, below, if
a) The completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure, except
for expansion in conformity with section 703.4., and
b) The foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three (3) additional feet as
measured from the uphill side of the structure (from original ground level to the bottom of the first
floor sill), it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
8
703.4.2 Reconstruction
a) Any non-conforming building or structure, which is hereafter damaged or destroyed by 50% or less
of its market value, may be restored or reconstructed in conformance with its original dimensions.
Nothing in this section will prevent the demolition of the remains of any building or structure
damaged or destroyed.
b) Any non-conforming structure that is located less than the required setback from the side, back or
front lot lines in any district or from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream,
or upland edge of a wetland in the Resource Protection District or the Shoreland District and that is
removed, or damaged or destroyed, regardless of the cause, by more than 50% of the market value
of the structure before such damage, destruction or removal, excluding normal maintenance and
repair, may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained from the Thomaston
Code Enforcement Officer within eighteen (18) months of the date of said damage, destruction, or
removal, and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the setback
requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Board of Appeals in accordance
with the purposes of this Ordinance. In no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as
to increase its non-conformity.
c) If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any
larger than the original structure, except as allowed pursuant to section 703.4.2(b) as determined by
the non-conforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location.
If the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed
beyond the required setback area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure
shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure. When
it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall
be replanted in accordance with section 703.4.3, if applicable.
d) In determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setbacks to the greatest
practical extent, the Board of Appeals or its designee shall consider in addition to the criteria in
703.4.3, if applicable, the physical condition and type of foundation present, if any.
703.4.3 Relocation within the Resource Protection District or the Shoreland District
A non-conforming structure in the Resource Protection District or the Shoreland District may be relocated
within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation
conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the
Board of Appeals, and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage
disposal system meets the requirements of State law and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater
Disposal Rules-(Rules), or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said Rules.
In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming.
In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback from a water body or wetland to the
greatest practical extent, the Board of Appeals or its designee shall consider the size of the lot, the slope
of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent
properties, the location of the septic system and other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and
the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation. When it is necessary to
remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure, the Board
of Appeals shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
9
addition, the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation.
Replanting shall be required as follows:
a) Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree, three
(3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If more than five trees are planted, no one species of tree
shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted no
further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed.
b) Other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order
to relocate a structure must be re-established. An area at least the same size as the area where vegetation
and/or ground cover was disturbed, damaged, or removed must be re-established within the
setback area. The vegetation and/or ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or
ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed or removed.
c) Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel, the original location of the structure shall
be replanted with vegetation that may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof.
703.4.4 Change of Use of a Non-conforming Structure in the Resource Protection District or the
Shoreland District
The use of a non-conforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the Board of Appeals,
after receiving a written application, determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact
on the water body, tributary stream or wetland or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources
than the existing use.
In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the Board of Appeals shall require written
documentation from the applicant, regarding the probable effects on public health and safety, erosion
and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of
public access to waters, natural beauty, flood-plain management, archaeological and historic resources,
and commercial fishing and maritime activities, and other functionally water-dependent uses.
703.5 Non- Conforming Uses
703.5.1 Discontinuance
If any non-conforming use ceases for any reason for a period of one year or more, any subsequent use
shall conform to the provisions of this Ordinance.
703.5.2 Resumption
Whenever a non-conforming use is changed to a permitted or conditional use, such land and/or structure(
s) shall not thereafter revert to a non-conforming use.
703.5.3 Expansion of Non-Conforming Use
Expansions of non-conforming uses within the Resource Protection District or the Shoreland District
are prohibited, except that non-conforming residential uses may, after obtaining a permit from the
Board of Appeals, be expanded within existing residential structures or within expansions of such
structures as allowed in Section 703.4.1.
703.6 Transfer of Ownership
Ownership of non-conforming lots, structures and/or uses as defined in this Ordinance may be transferred
without loss of their lawful but non-conforming status.

12
704.1.5 Conditional Use Permits
a) Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of this Section is to enable the Planning Board to review certain proposed uses of the
land that have the potential of creating unusual or undue impacts on surrounding properties, municipal
facilities, or the natural environment. A building, structure, or parcel of land may be used
for a conditional use if the use is specifically listed in the regulations governing the zoning district
in which the use is proposed, and if a conditional use permit is approved by the Board of Appeals.
b) Application for Conditional Use Permit
Application for a conditional use permit shall be made to the Code Enforcement Officer on forms
provided for the purpose accompanied by such fee as the Select Board shall set on an annual basis
for such applications.
The applicant shall:
1) Clearly specify the location of the proposed use, including street address, Assessor's tax map
and lot number, and a location map.
2) Describe the exact nature of the proposed use.
3) Submit such other materials as will enable the Planning Board to determine that the standards
for approval of a conditional use permit have been met. The burden of providing the information
upon which the Board bases its findings and of proving conformity with the standards
shall be the applicant's.
c) Standards for a Conditional Use Permit
A conditional use may be granted by the Planning Board only in the event that the applicant has established
to the satisfaction of the Board that:
1) Neither the proposed use nor the proposed site upon which the use will be located is of such a
character that the use will have significant adverse impact upon the value or quiet possession of
surrounding properties greater than would normally occur from such a use in the zoning district.
In reaching a determination on this standard, the Board shall consider:
i. the size of the proposed use compared with surrounding uses;
ii. the intensity of the proposed use, including amount and type of traffic to be generated,
hours of operation, expanse of pavement, and similar measures of intensity of use, compared
with surrounding uses;
iii. the potential generation of noise, dust, odor, vibration, glare, smoke, litter, and other nuisances;
iv. unusual physical characteristics of the site, including size of the lot, shape of the lot, topography,
and soils, which tend to aggravate adverse impacts upon surrounding properties;
and
v. the degree to which landscaping, fencing, and other design elements have been incorporated
to mitigate impacts on surrounding properties.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
13
2) Municipal facilities serving the proposed use will not be overburdened. In reaching a determination
on this standard the Board shall consider:
i. the ability of traffic to safely move into and out of the site at the proposed location;
ii. the presence of facilities to assure the safety of pedestrians passing by the site;
iii. the capacity of the street network to accommodate the proposed use;
iv. the capacity of public sewerage and water facilities, if they are to be used, to accommodate
the proposed use; and
v. the capacity of the public storm drainage system, if it is to be used, to accommodate the
proposed use.
3) The natural characteristics of the site, including topography, drainage, and relationship to
ground and surface waters and flood plains, shall not be such that the proposed use when
placed on the site will cause undue harm to the environment or to neighboring properties.
4) Undisclosed Future Uses:
i. In an application for a conditional use requiring renovation or enlargement of an existing
building or new construction, the applicant shall not be required to name specifically all the
uses on the lot if they are not known at the time of renovation, enlargement or new construction.
Instead, the applicant shall state on his/her application all the specific uses that
are anticipated for the lot.
ii. For the area on the lot for which the use is not then known, the applicant shall designate
those areas as "undisclosed future uses".
iii. The applicant must designate on the application at least one known conditional use.
iv. The Planning Board may grant conditional uses for the known specific uses and the project
may proceed to site review, if required, and a building permit may be issued after site plan
review, with the condition that any required conditional use permits for the undisclosed future
uses will be obtained when the uses are determined.
v. The lot shall not be used for the undisclosed future uses which require a conditional use until
the required conditional use approval is obtained.
5) In considering the foregoing standards the Planning Board shall fully review these standards
even though the applicant may also be subject to site plan approval.
d) Additional Standards in Shoreland Areas
For conditional use permit applications in shoreland areas, the Board shall additionally find that the
proposed use:
1) will not result in unreasonable damage to spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life, bird and other
wildlife habitat;
2) will reasonably conserve shoreland vegetation;
3) will reasonably conserve visual points of access to waters as viewed from public facilities;
4) will reasonably conserve actual points of public access to waters;
5) will reasonably conserve natural beauty;
6) will reasonably avoid problems associated with flood plain development or use;
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
14
7) Access from shore shall be developed on soils appropriate for such use and constructed so as to
reasonably control erosion or sedimentation on both subject and surrounding properties.
8) The use shall not unreasonably interfere with beach areas.
9) The facility shall be located so as to minimize adverse effect on marine harvesting and commercial
fishing.
10) The facility shall be located so as not to interfere with commercial or recreational boating and
moorings.
e) Conditions of Approval
When approving a conditional use permit, the Board shall identify in writing the conditions upon
which the permit is approved. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, such requirements
as:
1) street improvements;
2) access restrictions;
3) hours of use;
4) buffering and screening;
5) utility improvements;
6) performance guarantees for off-site improvements required as conditions of approval.
f) Reapplication
If the Planning Board shall deny a conditional use permit, the applicant shall within thirty (30) days
file a request for review by the Board of Appeals with the Thomaston Code Enforcement Officer on
forms to be approved by the CEO.
g) Duration of Conditional Use Permit
1) Provided all conditions and standards of approval are met, a conditional use permit shall be
transferable; however, should a conditional use cease for a period of one (1) year, said conditional
use shall expire and require Planning Board approval in order to resume.
2) A use granted by conditional use may be expanded in area or function only with the granting of
new conditional use approval by the Board of Appeals.
h) Scope of Permit
Any permit or approval granted hereunder is subject to all elements of the final plans and specifications
submitted by the applicant and to all representations, oral or written, made by or on behalf
of the applicant in support of the application or with respect to the nature and scope of the use, activity
or work proposed, and all such permits or approvals shall include, as an express condition, a
written statement to said effect.
i) Recourse
If the Planning Board shall deny a conditional use permit, the applicant may, within thirty (30)
days, file a request for review by the Board of Appeals with the Thomaston Code Enforcement Officer
on forms approved by the Board of Appeals.

a legal resident of the Town of Thomaston, or when a member fails to attend four (4) consecutive regular
meetings, or fails to attend at least 75% of all meetings during the preceding twelve (12) month
period. A vacancy may also occur when a non-participating member is removed at the discretion of
the Select Board, based on a recommendation made by a majority of the members of the Board of

23
705.1.5-A member of the Board may be dismissed for cause after notice and hearing by the Thomaston Select
Board before the expiration of his or her term.
705.2 Powers and Duties
705.2.1 Administrative Appeals
Appeals shall lie from the decision of the Thomaston Code Enforcement Officer and the Thomaston
Planning Board. The Thomaston Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by, or failure to act by, the
Code Enforcement Officer or the Planning Board in the enforcement or administration of this Ordinance.
Any party may take an appeal from a decision of the Board of Appeals, within 45 days of the
date of the Board’s vote on the original decision, to Superior Court from any order, relief or denial in
accordance with the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 80B. This time period may be extended by
the court upon motion for good cause shown. The hearing before the Superior Court must be without a
jury
705.2.2 Variances
A variance may be granted by the Board only where strict application of this Ordinance, or a provision
thereof, to the petitioner and his or her property would cause undue hardship and/or would not be in
the best interest of the community to strictly apply the ordinance to the property in question. A financial
hardship shall not constitute grounds for granting a variance. The crucial points of variance are
undue hardship and unique circumstances applying to the property. A variance is not justified unless
both elements are present in the case. Variances may be granted only from dimensional requirements
including but not limited to, lot width, structure height, percent of lot coverage, and setback requirements.
Any variance application that has any effect in the Shoreland District shall be submitted to the
Department of Environmental Protection at least twenty (20) days prior to any action of the Board of
Appeals along with all supporting information provided by the applicant.
"Undue hardship" shall mean:
a) That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted; reasonable
return does not mean maximum return;
b) That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general
conditions of the neighborhood;
c) That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality; and
d) That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.
Further, within the Shoreland Districts, a variance shall be granted only if the Board of Appeals makes
a positive finding, based on information presented to it, that the proposed uses:
e) Will not result in unsafe or unhealthful conditions;
f) Will not result in erosion or sedimentation;
g) Will not result in water pollution;
h) Will not result in damage to spawning ground, fish, aquatic life, bird and other wildlife habitat;
i) Will conserve shoreland vegetation;
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
24
j) Will conserve visual points of access to waters as viewed from public facilities;
k) Will conserve actual points of public access to waters;
l) Will conserve natural beauty;
m) Will avoid problems associated with flood-plain development and use.
705.2.3 Handicapped accessibility
The Board of Appeals may grant a variance to an owner of a residential dwelling for the purpose of
making that dwelling accessible to a person with a disability who resides in or regularly uses the dwelling,
or to provide handicapped accessibility to any structure(s) for which such accessibility is required
by the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Board shall restrict any variance granted under this subsection
solely to installation of equipment or the construction of structures necessary to provide handicapped
access to building(s) on the property. The Board may impose conditions on the variance, including
limiting the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the disability
lives in the dwelling. The term "structures necessary to provide handicapped access to the property"
shall include railing, wall or roof systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the access
structure(s).
The Board of Appeals shall limit any variances granted as strictly as possible in order to ensure conformance
with the purposes and provisions of this ordinance to the greatest extent possible, and in doing
so may impose such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary. The party receiving the variance
shall comply with any condition imposed.
705.2.4 Variance from Dimensional Standards
A variance may be granted from the dimensional standards of a zoning ordinance when strict application
of the ordinance to the petitioner and the petitioner’s property would cause a practical difficulty
and when the following conditions exist:
a) The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general
condition of the neighborhood;
b) The granting of a variance will not produce an undesirable change in the character of the neighborhood
and will not unreasonably detrimentally affect the use or market value of abutters’ properties;
c) The practical difficulty is not the result of action taken by the petitioner or a prior owner;
d) No other feasible alternative to a variance is available to the petitioner;
e) The granting of a variance will not unreasonably adversely affect the natural environment; and
f) The property is not located in whole or in part within Shoreland areas as described in Title 38 MRS
Section 435.
705.2.5 - A Copy of each Shoreland Zone Variance request, including the application and all supporting
information supplied by the applicant, shall be forwarded by the municipal officials to the Commissioner
of the Department of Environmental Protection at least twenty (20) days prior to action by the
Board of Appeals. Any comments received from the Commissioner prior to the action by the Board of
Appeals shall be made part of the record and shall be taken into consideration by the Board of Appeals.

Section 710 Rural Residential & Farming District (R1)
710.1 Purpose
This district includes most of the town’s rural lands. It also includes lands with multiple natural resource constraints
or that are especially important for their recreational, scenic, or other resource-based opportunities.
This district is designated as a rural, as opposed to growth zone. Its purpose is to allow a level of development
and activity, including farming and wood harvesting, consistent with the protection of the natural features of
these lands. Any residential development in this district must be compatible with the character and traditional
use of rural lands, preserving as much open space and forestland as possible, minimizing visual impact and
protecting scenic views. Cluster development is preferred for any residential subdivision in this district.

Section 711 Resource Protection District (RP)
711.1 Purpose
This district includes shoreland areas and other lands of unique geologic and natural features, especially those
that include wetlands, wildlife habitats, steep slopes and unstable soils. The purpose of the district is to maintain
the safe and healthful conditions of these lands and protect them from development that would disrupt
productive habitat systems, degrade water quality, or destroy scenic value.
711.2 Boundary Description
Major Wetlands
1) Areas within two hundred fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the Normal High Water Line (NHWL) of
tidal waters, of the upland edge of salt marshes and salt meadows, and of freshwater wetlands associated
with rivers; and wetlands that are rated "moderate" or "high" value waterfowl and wading-bird habitat, including
nesting and feeding areas, by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIF&W)
that are depicted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) data layer maintained by the Maine Office of
Geographic Information Systems (MOGIS). For the purpose of this paragraph, “wetlands associated with
rivers” shall mean areas characterized by non-forested wetland vegetation and hydric soils that are contiguous
with a river, and have a surface elevation at or below the water level of the river during the period of
normal high water. “Wetlands associated with rivers” are considered to be part of the river.
2) The floodplains along rivers, defined by the one hundred (100) year floodplain as designated on the Federal
Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Map effective July 7, 2016, excluding
those areas located in the Shoreland Commercial District.
Steep Slopes and Areas with Wetland Characteristics not part of an Identified Wetland
3) Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres with sustained slopes of twenty (20) percent or greater, except
that human excavated slopes, including, but not limited to, quarries, borrow pits, and road embankments,
are not included. Such areas are not depicted on the Official Zoning Map but must be determined on the
ground.
4) Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres supporting wetland vegetation and hydric soils, which are not
part of a freshwater or coastal wetland as defined, and which are not surficially connected to a water body
during the period of normal high water. Such areas are not depicted on the Official Zoning Map but must
be determined on the ground.
Areas Subject to Severe Erosion
5) Land areas along rivers subject to severe bank erosion, undercutting, or riverbed movement and lands adjacent
to tidal waters that are subject to severe erosion or mass movement, such as steep coastal bluffs.

GENERAL STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE
All development proposed within the Town of Thomaston shall comply with the standards specified in Article
II, Sections 715 through 722 of this ordinance, in addition to those standards pertaining to the particular district
in which the development occurs. The Thomaston Code Enforcement Officer may employ any independent,
recognized consultant(s) necessary, after prior notification to and at the expense of the applicant, to ensure
compliance with all requirements of this ordinance related to the public health, safety and welfare and the
abatement of nuisances. The applicant shall deposit the estimated costs of such studies with the Town of
Thomaston prior to their undertaking.
Section 715 Shoreland Standards
To aid in the fulfillment of the State’s role as trustee of its waters and to promote public health, safety and the
general welfare, it is declared to be in the public interest that the Shoreland Zone, defined as those land areas
any part of which are located within 250 feet of the normal high-water line (NHWL) of any river or saltwater
body; within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of a coastal or freshwater wetland associated with
a river system or at the upland edge of a freshwater wetland not associated with a river system; within 75 feet,
horizontal distance, of the NHWL of a stream; and within 15 feet of the center line of stormwater drainage
channels that are identified as essential for their purpose; all as defined in this Ordinance, be subject to the
standards of this section, where applicable.
The purpose of such standards is to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control
water pollution; protect wildlife spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life, bird and wildlife habitat; protect
freshwater and coastal wetlands; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; to protect commercial
fishing and maritime industries; protect archaeological and historic resources; conserve shore cover,
visual as well as actual points of access to inland and coastal waters; conserve natural beauty and open space;
and to anticipate and respond to the impacts of development in Shoreland areas.
715.1 Applicability
The following conditions, limitations or standards shall apply to any use or structure permitted on land located
within the Shoreland Zone (Resource Protection and Shoreland Commercial Districts, as defined in this Ordinance),
if applicable, in addition to all other standards and conditions required by this Ordinance:

715.2.1-All new principal and accessory structures shall be set back at least one hundred (100) feet, horizontal
distance, from the NHWL of great ponds classified GPA and rivers that flow to great ponds
classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of
other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland, except that in the Shoreland
Commercial District there shall be no minimum setback. In the Resource Protection District the setback
requirement shall be 250 feet, horizontal distance, except for structures, roads, parking spaces or
other regulated objects specifically allowed in that district in which case the setback requirements
specified above shall apply.
715.2.2-Permitting under the Natural Resources Protection Act for activities adjacent to significant wildlife
habitat areas may require greater setbacks. Contact your local Department of Environmental Protection
office to see if additional permitting is required.

715.16-Clearing or Removal of Vegetation for Activities Other Than Timber Harvesting
715.16.1-In a Resource Protection District abutting a great pond, there shall be no cutting of vegetation
within the strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water
line, except to remove hazard trees as described in Section 715.17.
715.16.2-Elsewhere, in any Resource Protection District the cutting or removal of vegetation shall be limited
to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that district.
715.16.3-Except in areas as described in Section 715.16.1, above, within a strip of land extending onehundred
(100) feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified
GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, or within a strip extending seventy-five
(75) feet, horizontal distance, from any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a
wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be preserved as follows:
a) There shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square feet in the forest canopy (or other existing
woody vegetation if a forested canopy is not present) as measured from the outer limits of the
tree or shrub crown. However, a single footpath not to exceed six (6) feet in width as measured
between tree trunks and/or shrub stems is allowed for accessing the shoreline provided that a
cleared line of sight to the water through the buffer strip is not created.
b) Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed provided that a well-distributed stand
of trees and other natural vegetation is maintained.
For the purposes of this Section a "well-distributed stand of trees" adjacent to a great pond classified
GPA or a river or stream flowing to a great pond classified GPA, shall be defined as maintaining
a rating score of 24 or more in each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular (1,250 square feet) area
as determined by the following rating system.
Diameter of Tree at
4-1/2 feet Above
Ground Level (inches) Points
2 - < 4 in. .................................... 1
4 – <8 in. ..................................... 2
8-< 12 in...................................... 4
12 in. or greater ......................... 8
Adjacent to other water bodies, tributary streams, and wetlands, a "well-distributed stand of
trees" is defined as maintaining a minimum rating score of 16 per 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular
area.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
81
NOTE: As an example, adjacent to a great pond, if a 25-foot x 50-foot plot contains four (4) trees between 2
and 4 inches in diameter, two trees between 4 and 8 inches in diameter, three trees between 8 and 12 inches
in diameter, and two trees over 12 inches in diameter, the rating score is:
(4x1) + (2x2) + (3x4) + (2x8) = 36 points
Thus, the 25-foot by 50-foot plot contains trees worth 36 points. Trees totaling 12 points (36 - 24
= 12) may be removed from the plot provided that no cleared openings are created.
The following shall govern in applying this point system:
i. The 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular plots must be established where the landowner or lessee
proposes clearing within the required buffer;
ii. Each successive plot must be adjacent to, but not overlap a previous plot;
iii. Any plot not containing the required points must have no vegetation removed except as otherwise
allowed by this Ordinance;
iv. Any plot containing the required points may have vegetation removed down to the minimum
points required or as otherwise allowed by is Ordinance;
v. Where conditions permit, no more than 50% of the points on any 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular
area may consist of trees greater than 12 inches in diameter.
For the purposes of this Section “other natural vegetation” is defined as retaining existing vegetation
under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover and retaining at least five (5) saplings
less than two (2) inches in diameter at four and one-half (4½) feet above ground level for each 25-
foot by 50-foot rectangle area. If five saplings do not exist, no woody stems less than two (2) inches
in diameter can be removed until 5 saplings have been recruited into the plot.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than 40% of the total volume of trees four (4)
inches or more in diameter, measured at four and one-half (4½) feet above ground level may be
removed in any ten (10) year period.
c) In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing vegetation under three (3) feet in
height and other ground cover, including leaf litter and the forest duff layer, shall not be cut, covered,
or removed, except to provide for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in Sections
715.16.3 and 715.16.3(a) above.
d) Pruning of tree branches, on the bottom 1/3 of the tree is allowed.
e) In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the removal of storm-damaged, dead or
hazard trees results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings shall be replanted with
native tree species in accordance with Section 715.17, below, unless existing new tree growth is
present.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
82
f) In order to maintain the vegetation in the shoreline buffer, clearing or removal of vegetation for
allowed activities, including associated construction and related equipment operation, within or
outside the shoreline buffer, must comply with the requirements of Section 715.16.3.
715.16.4-At distances greater than one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from a great pond classified
GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance,
from the normal high-water line of any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge
of a wetland, there shall be allowed on any lot, in any ten (10) year period, selective cutting of not
more than forty (40) percent of the volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured
four and one-half (4½) feet above ground level. Tree removal in conjunction with the development of
permitted uses shall be included in the forty (40) percent calculation. For the purposes of these standards
volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
a) In no event shall cleared openings for any purpose, including but not limited to, principal and
accessory structures, driveways, lawns and sewage disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate, 25%
of the lot area within the Resource Protection District or ten thousand (10,000) square feet, whichever
is greater, including land previously cleared. This provision applies to the portion of a lot
within the Resource Protection District, including the buffer area.
715.16.5-Legally existing nonconforming cleared openings may be maintained, but shall not be enlarged,
except as allowed by this Ordinance.
715.16.6-Fields and other cleared openings which have reverted to primarily shrubs, trees, or other
woody vegetation shall be regulated under the provisions of Section 715.16.
715.17-Hazard Trees, Storm-Damaged Trees, and Dead Tree Removal
715.17.1-Hazard trees in the Shoreland Zone may be removed without a permit after consultation with
the Code Enforcement Officer if the following requirements are met:
a) Within the shoreline buffer, if the removal of a hazard tree results in a cleared opening in the tree
canopy greater than two hundred and fifty (250) square feet, replacement with native tree species
is required, unless there is new tree growth already present. New tree growth must be as near as
practicable to where the hazard tree was removed and be at least two (2) inches in diameter,
measured at four and one-half (4½) feet above the ground level. If new growth is not present,
then replacement trees shall consist of native species and be at least four (4) feet in height, and be
no less than two (2) inches in diameter. Stumps may not be removed.
b) Outside of the shoreline buffer, when the removal of hazard trees exceeds forty (40) percent of the
volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured at four and one-half (4½) feet
above ground level in any ten (10) year period, and/or results in cleared openings exceeding
twenty-five (25) percent of the lot area within the Shoreland Zone, or ten thousand (10,000)
square feet, whichever is greater, replacement with native tree species is required, unless there is
new tree growth already present. New tree growth must be as near as practicable to where the
hazard tree was removed and be at least two (2) inches in diameter, measured at four and onehalf
(4½) feet above the ground level. If new growth is not present, then replacement trees shall
consist of native species and be at least two (2) inches in diameter, measured at four and one-half
(4½) feet above the ground level.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
83
c) The removal of standing dead trees, resulting from natural causes, is permissible without the
need for replanting or a permit, as long as the removal does not result in the creation of new lawn
areas, or other permanently cleared areas, and stumps are not removed. For the purposes of this
provision dead trees are those trees that contain no foliage during the growing season.
d) The Code Enforcement Officer may require the property owner to submit an evaluation from a licensed
forester or arborist before any hazard tree can be removed within the Shoreland Zone.
e) The Code Enforcement Officer may require more than a one–for-one replacement for hazard trees
removed that exceed eight (8) inches in diameter measured at four and one-half (4½) feet above
the ground level.
715.17.2-Storm-damaged trees in the Shoreland Zone may be removed without a permit after consultation
with the Code Enforcement Officer if the following requirements are met:
a) Within the shoreline buffer, when the removal of storm-damaged trees results in a cleared opening
in the tree canopy greater than two hundred and fifty (250) square feet, replanting is not required,
but the area shall be required to naturally revegetate, and the following requirements
must be met:
i. The area from which a storm-damaged tree is removed does not result in new lawn areas, or
other permanently cleared areas;
ii. Stumps from the storm-damaged trees may not be removed;
iii. Limbs damaged from a storm event may be pruned even if they extend beyond the bottom
one-third (1/3) of the tree; and
iv. If after one growing season, no natural regeneration or regrowth is present, replanting of native
tree seedlings or saplings is required at a density of one seedling per every eighty (80)
square feet of lost canopy.
b) Outside of the shoreline buffer, if the removal of storm damaged trees exceeds 40% of the volume
of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured at four and one-half (4½) feet above the
ground level in any ten (10) year period, or results, in the aggregate, in cleared openings exceeding
25% of the lot area within the Shoreland Zone or ten thousand (10,000) square feet, whichever
is greater, and no natural regeneration occurs within one growing season, then native tree seedlings
or saplings shall be replanted on a one-for-one basis.
715.18-Exemptions to Clearing and Vegetation Removal Requirements
The following activities are exempt from the clearing and vegetation removal standards set forth in Section
715.16, provided that all other applicable requirements of this chapter are complied with, and the

was removed and at a density comparable to the pre-existing vegetation, except where a shoreline
stabilization activity does not allow revegetation to occur in the same area and at a density comparable
to the pre-existing vegetation, in which case revegetation must occur along the same segment
of shoreline and as close as possible to the area where vegetation was removed:
715.19.3-If part of a permitted activity, revegetation shall occur before the expiration of the permit. If the
activity or revegetation is not completed before the expiration of the permit, a new revegetation plan
shall be submitted with any renewal or new permit application.

c) If more than three (3) trees or saplings are planted, then at least three (3) different species shall be
used;
d) No one species shall make up 50% or more of the number of trees and saplings planted;
e) If revegetation is required for a shoreline stabilization project, and it is not possible to plant trees
and saplings in the same area where trees or saplings were removed, then trees or sapling must
be planted in a location that effectively reestablishes the screening between the shoreline and
structures; and
f) A survival rate of at least eighty (80) percent of planted trees or saplings is required for a minimum
five (5) years period.
715.19.5-Revegetation activities must meet the following requirements for woody vegetation and other
vegetation under three (3) feet in height:

c) If more than three (3) woody vegetation plants are to be planted, then at least three (3) different
species shall be planted;
d) No one species shall make up 50% or more of the number of planted woody vegetation plants;
and
e) Survival of planted woody vegetation and vegetation under three feet in height must be sufficient
to remain in compliance with the standards contained within this chapter for minimum of five (5)
years
715.19.6-Revegetation activities must meet the following requirements for ground vegetation and ground
cover:
a) All ground vegetation and ground cover removed must be replaced with native herbaceous vegetation,
in quantities and variety sufficient to prevent erosion and provide for effective infiltration
of stormwater;

effective infiltration of stormwater; and
c) Survival and functionality of ground vegetation and ground cover must be sufficient to remain in
compliance with the standards contained within this chapter for minimum of five (5) years.
715.20-Erosion and Sedimentation Control
715.20.1-All activities which involve filling, grading, excavation or other similar activities which result in
unstabilized soil conditions and which require a permit shall also require a written soil erosion and
sedimentation control plan. The plan shall be submitted to the permitting authority for approval and
shall include, where applicable, provisions for:
a) Mulching and revegetation of disturbed soil.
b) Temporary runoff control features such as hay bales, silt fencing or diversion ditches.
c) Permanent stabilization structures such as retaining walls or rip-rap.
715.20.2-In order to create the least potential for erosion, development shall be designed to fit with the
topography and soils of the site. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall
be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours shall be followed as closely as possible.
715.20.3-Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed project
involving land disturbance, and shall be in operation during all stages of the activity. The amount of
exposed soil at every phase of construction shall be minimized to reduce the potential for erosion.

free of all debris and trash, trimmed at least once a year and managed in order to maintain
the plant community for which they were established.
e) Cultivated landscaped areas around and in conjunction with parking lots and signs are required as
detailed in section 716.16.6.
f) For each one hundred feet (100’) in length, this buffer zone at the minimum shall contain two (2)
canopy or evergreen trees, four (4) under-story trees and six (6) shrubs.
g) For every mature canopy or evergreen tree existing in the buffer area and retained within this area,
the required number of new trees shall be reduced by two (2). If any such retained tree dies within
five (5) years of the date of the issuance of the original permit, it shall be replaced with two (2) canopy
trees meeting the standards of this ordinance.
h) A canopy tree is a tree that reaches at least thirty-five (35) feet in height at maturity; an evergreen
tree is at least thirty-five (35) feet at maturity. An under-story tree reaches ten (10) feet to thirty-five
(35) feet at maturity. Shrubs have mature heights of two (2) to ten (10) feet.
i) The above plants shall have the following minimum size standards at the time of installation, with
calipers measured in diameter at breast height:

716.16.5 Architectural-Review Guidelines
The compatible relationship of architecture along the road in the district is of critical public concern for
any new buildings or site improvements. The intent of these guidelines is to ensure respect for the visual
experience and to reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on the visual experience from the roadway
and to protect the gateways into the Town of Thomaston. To accomplish this, the Planning Board
shall utilize the following guidelines in reviewing proposed structures and site improvements:
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
98
716.16.5.1-Proposed development shall avoid excessive or unsightly grading, indiscriminate earthmoving
or clearing of property and removal of trees and vegetation that could cause disruption of
natural water courses or disfigure natural land forms.
716.16.5.2-Proposed development shall be located and configured in a visually harmonious manner
with the terrain and vegetation of the parcel and surrounding parcels. Structures shall impede as little
as reasonably practical, scenic views from the main road or from existing structures and the natural
environment.
716.16.5.3-The architectural design of structures and their materials and colors shall be visually harmonious
with the overall appearance, history and cultural heritage of the Town of Thomaston, with natural
land forms and existing vegetation and with other development plans already approved by the
town. Architectural design of all non-residential structures must be designed to be unobtrusive and
set into the natural environment in accordance with the following section:
a) Pitched roof, or the appearance of pitched roofs, with minimum slope of five and one-half (5½)
inches per foot is strongly encouraged. Long, monotonous façade designs including, but not limited
to, those characterized by unrelieved repetition of shape or form or by unbroken extension of
line shall be avoided.
b) Clapboards, wood shingles, bricks, or other materials with similar texture and appearance are
recommended.
c) Colors of materials, paints and stains shall be compatible with the existing overall appearance of
the location.
d) The location and dimensions of wall signs shall be indicated and shall maintain compatibility with
architectural features of the building.
716.16.6 Parking Lot Design and Landscaping
General-All development shall provide permanent off-street parking space in accordance with and at
a minimum in the amount specified by the Thomaston Land Use and Development Ordinance. Required
off-street parking spaces shall be so designed, arranged and regulated as to have individual
parking spaces marked unobstructed and have access to an aisle or driveway so that any automobile
may be moved without moving another, and so that no maneuvering directly incidental to entering and
leaving a parking space shall be on any public right-of-way or walkway; the space shall be provided
with bumper guards or wheel guards so located that no part of the parked vehicle will extend beyond
the boundary of the established parking area into any minimum required yard. Such parking areas
shall be graded and properly drained in such a manner that there will be no free flow of water onto any
adjacent property.
716.16.6.1 Shared Parking
The required parking space for any number of separate uses may be combined in one facility. Generally,
the required space assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use; thus, the total
available spaces should be the sum of required spaces for each individual uses. Shared parking facilities
where available parking is below the strict requirements for users set forth in this ordinance
shall be allowable when the functional nature of the uses allow for differing peak-hour demands.
The number of spaces required in such a shared facility shall be determined by the Planning Board
in accordance with the guidelines of the Thomaston Land Use and Development Ordinance. Any
such combined use will require the recording of a perpetual easement in form and substance acceptable
to the Planning Board, in the Office of the Knox County Registry of Deeds.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019

716.16.6.2 Landscaping
Parking areas shall be suitably landscaped to minimize noise, glare and other nuisance characteristics
as well as to enhance the environment and ecology of the site and surrounding area. As a guideline,
large parking lots shall be designed and landscaped to fit harmoniously within the landscape and
wherever possible shall be broken down into sections of not more than forty (40) spaces, separated
from other sections by landscaped dividing islands, strips, berms, and similar elements, in accordance
with the following requirements:
a) The cultivated landscaping of the perimeter of all off-street parking areas is required except for access-
ways as necessary. The minimum width of the perimeter landscape strip shall be ten (10) feet
and shall be landscaped with at least one (1) tree and five (5) shrubs for every thirty (30) feet of
parking lot perimeter. Trees and shrubs in a perimeter landscape strip may be planted singly or in
clusters. The remainder of the perimeter landscape strip shall be landscaped with grass, ground
cover or other appropriate landscape treatment. Sand or pavement shall not be considered to be appropriate
landscape treatment.

719.1 Clustered Residential Development
In all Residential Districts the following special provisions may apply subject to the conditions set forth herein.
Notwithstanding other provisions of this Ordinance relating to space and bulk, the Thomaston Planning Board,
in reviewing and approving proposed residential developments located in Thomaston, may modify said provisions
related to space and bulk to permit innovative approaches to housing and environmental design in accordance
with the following standards. This shall not be construed as granting variances to relieve hardship.
Innovative approaches to residential layout and environmental design shall be subject to the following criteria:
719.1.1-The purpose and intent of this Land Use and Development Ordinance shall be upheld;
719.1.2-There shall be compliance with all State and local codes and ordinances;
719.1.3-Each building shall be an element of an overall plan for site development. Only developments having
a total site plan for structures will be considered;
719.1.4-There shall be no approval of any proposed development that exceeds the allowable net residential
densities permitted without appeal in the district in which it is located. For the purposes of this Ordinance,
net residential density shall be established by the area of residual space available for residential
development after deduction of vehicular rights-of-way and land not buildable because of drainage,
subsurface conditions or other natural impediment.
719.1.5-Residual open space shall be usable for recreational or other outdoor-living purposes and for preserving
large trees, tree groves, woods, ponds, streams, glens, rock outcrops, native plant life and wildlife
cover. The use of any open space may be further limited or controlled at the time of final approval
where necessary to protect adjacent properties or uses. Residual open space shall be dedicated to the
recreational amenity and environmental enhancement of the development and shall be recorded as
such. Such dedications may include private covenants or arrangements to preserve the integrity of
open spaces and their use for agricultural or conservation purposes.
719.1.6-The developer shall take into consideration the following points, and shall illustrate the treatment
of spaces, paths, roads, service and parking areas and other features required in the proposal.
a) Orientation: buildings and other improvements shall respect scenic vistas and natural features.
b) Streets: access from public ways, internal circulation and parking shall be designed to provide for vehicular
and pedestrian safety and convenience, emergency and fire equipment, snow clearance, street
maintenance, delivery and collection services. Streets shall be laid out and constructed consistent
with local requirements.
c) Drainage: adequate provision shall be made for storm waters, with particular concern for the effects
of any effluent draining from the site. Erosion resulting from any improvements on the site shall be
prevented by landscaping or other means.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019

soil conditions and potential pollution of surface or ground waters.
e) Water Supply: adequate provision shall be made for both ordinary use as well as special fire needs.
f) Utilities: all utilities shall be installed underground wherever possible. Transformer boxes, pumping
stations, and meters shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to the public.
g) Recreation: facilities shall be provided consistent with the development proposal.
h) Buffering: planting, landscaping, disposition and form of buildings and other improvements, or fencing
and screening shall be utilized to integrate the proposed development with the landscape and the
character of any surrounding development.
i) Disposition of Buildings: shall recognize the need for natural light and ventilation.
719.1.7-For the purposes of this section, the tract or parcel of land involved must be either in single ownership,
or the subject of an application filed jointly by the owners of all the property included.
719.1.8-The developer shall file with the Town of Thomaston at the time of submission of final plans a performance
guarantee. This may be tendered in the form of a certified check payable to the Town of
Thomaston, a savings-account passbook issued in the name of the Town of Thomaston, or a faithful performance
bond running to the Town of Thomaston and issued by a surety company acceptable to the
municipality. The conditions and amount of such check, passbook or performance bond shall be determined
by the Thomaston Town Manager with the advice of various departments or agencies concerned.
The amount shall be at least equal to the total cost of furnishing, installing, connecting and
completing the entire street grading, paving, storm drainage, and utilities or other improvements specified
in the final plan, and shall guarantee the satisfactory completion of all specified improvements.
719.1.9-Common open space shall be dedicated after approval of the project. There shall be no further
subdivision of this land, nor buildings constructed upon it without further planning review and that
would cause the net residential density to exceed the density permitted in that district.
719.1.10-The common open space(s) shall be shown on the development plan and with appropriate notation
on the face thereof to indicate that:
a) It shall not be used for future building lots.
b) A part or all of the common open space may, at the option of the Town of Thomaston, be dedicated for
acceptance by the Town of Thomaston for operation as a municipal recreation facility.
719.1.11-If any or all of the common open space is to be reserved for use by the residents, the formation
and incorporation by the developer of a neighborhood association shall be required prior to final plat
approval.
719.1.12-Covenants for mandatory membership in the neighborhood association setting forth the owner’s
rights and interest and privileges in the neighborhood association and the common land shall be approved
by the Thomaston Planning Board and included in the deed for each lot.

expenses connected with the maintenance of open space, neighborhood recreational facilities and Town
of Thomaston assessments.

ARTICLE III LAND SUBDIVISIONS
Section 723 Purpose
The purposes of these regulations are to ensure the comfort, convenience, safety, health and welfare of the people
of the Town of Thomaston, to protect the environment and to promote the development of an economically
sound and stable community. To this end, in approving subdivisions in the Town of Thomaston, the Thomaston
Planning Board shall consider the following criteria and, before granting approval, shall make written findings
of fact that the provisions of these regulations have been met and that the proposed subdivision will meet the
following criteria from Title 30-A M.R.S.A. 4404.
723.1-Will not result in undue water or air pollution. In making this determination, the board shall at least
consider the elevation of the land above sea level and its relation to the floodplains; the nature of soils
and subsoil and their ability to adequately support waste disposal; the slope of the land and its effect on
effluents; the availability of streams for the disposal of effluents, and the applicable state and local
health and waste-resource regulations; including minimum lot size recommendations as recommended
by the Department of Health Engineering, State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules.
723.2-Has sufficient water available for the reasonable foreseeable needs of the subdivision;
723.3-Will not causes an unreasonable burden on an existing water supply, if one is to be utilized;

that a dangerous or unhealthy condition may result;
723.5-Will not cause unreasonable highway or public-road congestion or unsafe conditions with respect to
use of the highways or public roads existing or proposed and, if the proposed subdivision requires
driveways or entrances onto a state or state-aid highway located outside the urban-compact area of an
urban- compact municipality as defined by Title 23, section 754, the Department of Transportation has
provided documentation indicating that the driveways or entrances conform to Title 23, section 704

sites or rare and irreplaceable natural areas or any public rights for physical or visual access to the
shoreline, and;
723.9-Is in conformance with a duly adopted subdivision regulation or ordinance, comprehensive plan,
development plan or land-use plan, if any. In making this determination, the municipal reviewing authority
is authorized to interpret these regulations and plans;
723.10-The sub-divider has adequate financial and technical capacity to meet the above stated standards.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
132
723.11-Whenever situated, in whole or in part, within 250 feet of any pond, lake, river or tidal waters, will
not adversely affect the quality of that body of water or unreasonably affect the shoreline of that body
of water. Furthermore, when lots in a subdivision have frontage on an outstanding river segment, as
defined in M.P.S.A. 4956, the proposed subdivision plan shall require principal structures to have a
combined lot-- shore frontage and setback from the normal high-water mark of five hundred (500) feet.
723.12-Will not, alone or in conjunction with existing activities, adversely affect the quality or quantity of
ground water; and;
723.13-The sub-divider will determine, based on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps, whether the subdivision is in a floodprone
area. If the subdivision, or any part of it, is in such an area, the sub-divider will determine the
100-year flood elevation and flood-hazard boundaries within the subdivision. The proposed subdivision
plan shall include a condition of plan approval requiring that principal structures on lots in the
subdivision shall be constructed with their lowest floor, including the basement, at least one foot above
the 100-year flood elevation.
723.14-All freshwater wetlands within the proposed subdivision have been identified on any maps submitted
as a part of the application, regardless of the size of these wetlands. Any mapping of freshwater
wetlands may be done with the help of the local soil and water conservation district.
723.15-Any river, stream or brook within or abutting the proposed subdivision has been identified on any
maps submitted as part of the application. For the purposes of this section, “river, stream or brook” has
the same meaning as in 38 MRS Section 480B, Subsection 9.
723.16-The proposed subdivision will provide for adequate storm-water management.

The long-term cumulative effects of the proposed subdivision will not unreasonably increase a great
pond’s phosphorus concentration during the construction phase and life of the proposed subdivision;
and
723.19 – Impact on adjoining municipality.
For any proposed subdivision that crosses municipal boundaries, the proposed subdivision will not
cause unreasonable traffic congestion or unsafe condition with respect to the use of existing public
ways in an adjoining municipality in which part of the subdivision is located.

eliminate liquidation harvesting has occurred, the municipal reviewing authority must determine
prior to granting approval for the subdivision that 5 years have elapsed from the date the
landowner under whose ownership the harvest occurred acquired the parcel. A municipal reviewing
authority may request technical assistance from the Department of Conservation, Bureau of Forestry to
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 7, Land Use, Chapter 10, Definitions & Chapter 3, ICC Building Code 6/12/2019
133

certified by a forester licensed pursuant to Title 32, chapter 76. If a municipal reviewing authority
requests technical assistance from the bureau, the bureau agrees to provide assistance, it shall
make a finding and determination as to whether a rule violation has occurred. The bureau shall provide
a written copy of its find and determination to the municipal reviewing authority within 30 days of receipt
of the municipal reviewing authority’s request. If the bureau notifies a municipal reviewing authority
that the bureau will not provide assistance, the municipal reviewing authority may require a
subdivision applicant to provide a determination certified by a licensed forester.
For the purpose of this subsection, “liquidation harvesting” has the same meaning as Title 12, section
8868, subsection 6 and “parcel” means a contiguous area within one municipality, township or plantation
owned by one person or a group of persons in common or joint ownership. This subsection takes
effect on the effective date of rules adopted pursuant to Title 12, section 8869, subsection 14.

ARTICLE IV SITE-PLAN REVIEW
Section 735 Projects Reviewed
735.1 Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of site-plan review is to assess the impact of new development on surrounding properties,
municipal facilities and services, and the natural environment. Only uses that have been established as
permitted uses, either as a matter of right or as a result of successful review as a conditional use, are intended
to be able to proceed to site-plan review. Therefore, the purpose of site-plan review is not to establish
the right of a use to be located in the area proposed, but rather it is to assure that the way the
use is designed and placed on a lot is appropriate to its surroundings. This section shall apply to:
735.1.1 - Proposals for new construction of or conversion to Commercial or Industrial buildings or
structures, above ground or underground tanks or other installations and of multi-unit dwellings,
including their accessory buildings or structures and all impervious areas.

applicant, building inspector, Town Manager and Select Board of the Town of Thomaston. The time
limit for review may be extended by mutual agreement between the Planning Board and applicant.
During this thirty (30) day period, the board may schedule an on-site visit.
736.6 - Within seven (7) days of reaching its decision, the Planning Board shall notify the applicant in writing
of its action and the reason for taking such action. All decisions of the Thomaston Planning Board

On appeal, the review of the site Plan decision shall be limited to correction of clear errors of law made
by the Planning Board in connection with the site plan decision, and the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
have no authority to reverse or modify a factual finding of the Planning Board. In connection with such
an appeal, the review of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be based exclusively on the record before
the Planning Board. Upon receipt of an appeal of a site-plan decision, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
defer consideration of that appeal for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, in order to permit consideration
of an appeal of the issuance or denial of a building permit for the same project. At such a meeting
concerning both appeals, the appeal of the issuance or denial of the building permit shall not be

In all instances the burden of proof shall be on the applicant and such burden of proof shall include the
production of evidence necessary to complete the application.
739.1 - Preserve and Enhance the Landscape
The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state insofar as practical by minimizing tree removal,
disturbance of soil and by retaining existing vegetation during construction. After construction is completed,
landscaping shall be designed and planted to define, soften or screen the appearance of offstreet
parking areas from the public right-of-way and abutting properties and/or structures and to minimize
the encroachment of the proposed use on neighboring land uses. The requirements of 716.16.6.4,
Standards for Commercial/Industrial Use, Shall also be taken into consideration.

paving or other surfaces that will not be re-vegetated.
739.3 - Relationship of the Proposed Building to Environment and Neighboring Buildings.
The physical placement of proposed buildings or structures on the site shall fit harmoniously with the
terrain of the site and with neighboring buildings or structures, taking into account the bulk, location
and height of the buildings or structures and such natural features as slope, soil type and drainage
ways. The proposed building or structures shall not interfere unreasonably with the solar access of existing
buildings or adjacent parcels.

unreasonably adverse effect on neighboring properties, downstream water quality, soil erosion or the
public storm-drain system. Whenever possible, on-site absorption of runoff waters shall be used to
minimize discharges from the site. Drainage facilities shall be designed for a twenty-five (25) year storm
frequency.
The development shall not impose an unreasonable burden on sewers and storm drains, water lines or
other public utilities. New utilities shall be sized and existing utilities upgraded to adequately handle
the demands of the development.
739.6 - Special Features of Development
Exposed storage areas, exposed machinery installation, service areas, truck-loading areas, utility buildings
and similar structures shall have setbacks and screening to provide a buffer to sight and sound
sufficient to minimize their adverse impact on other land uses within the development area and on surrounding
properties.
739.7 - Exterior Lighting

SECTION 801 - PURPOSE AND ESTABLISHMENT
Certain areas of the Town of Thomaston, Maine are subject to periodic flooding, causing serious damages
to properties within these areas. Relief is available in the form of flood insurance as authorized by the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.

National Flood Insurance Program, and agrees to comply with the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended) as delineated in this Floodplain Management
Ordinance.
It is the intent of the Town of Thomaston, Maine to require the recognition and evaluation of flood hazards
in all official actions relating to land use in the floodplain areas having special flood hazards.
The Town of Thomaston has the legal authority to adopt land use and control measures to reduce future
flood losses pursuant to Title 30-A MRSA, Articles 3001-3007, 4352, 4401-4407, and Title 38 MRSA,
Article 440.
The National Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid Act, provides that areas of the Town
of Thomaston having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas. This Ordinance
establishes a Flood Hazard Development Permit system and review procedure for development activities in
the designated flood hazard areas of the Town of Thomaston, Maine.
The areas of special flood hazard, Zones A and AE, for the Town of Thomaston, Knox County, Maine,
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a report entitled “Flood Insurance Study –
Knox County, Maine”, dated July 6, 2016 with accompanying “Flood Insurance Rate Map” dated July 6,
2016 with panels: 170D, 327D, 328D, 329D, 333D, and 335D, derived from the county wide digital Flood
Insurance Rate Map entitled “Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map, Knox County, Maine”, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance.

SECTION 809 - APPEALS AND VARIANCES
The Board of Appeals of the Town of Thomaston may, upon written application of an aggrieved party,
hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or
determination made by, or failure to act by, the Code Enforcement Officer or Planning Board in the
administration or enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance.
The Board of Appeals may grant a variance from the requirements of this Ordinance consistent with state
law and the following criteria:
809.1 Variances shall not be granted within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
809.2 Variances shall be granted only upon:
809.2.1 a showing of good and sufficient cause; and,
809.2.2 a determination that should a flood comparable to the base flood occur, the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, public
expense, or create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances; and,
809.2.3 a showing that the issuance of the variance will not conflict with other state, federal or local
laws or ordinances; and,
809.2.4 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in “undue hardship,” which in
this Section means:
809.2.4.1 that the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is
granted; and,
809.2.4.2 that the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and
not to the general conditions in the neighborhood; and,
809.2.4.3 that the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality;
and,
809.2.4.4 that the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.
809.3 Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and the Board of Appeals may impose such
conditions to a variance as it deems necessary.
809.4 Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements, or other development
for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
809.4.1 other criteria of Section 809 and Section 805.11 are met; and,
809.4.2 the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 8, Flood Plain Management Adopted 6/15/2016
13
809.5 Variances may be issued for the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of Historic
Structures upon the determination that:
809.5.1 the development meets the criteria of Section 809, paragraphs 809.1 through 809.4 above;
and,
809.5.2 the proposed repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
809.6 Any applicant who meets the criteria of Sections 809.1 through 809.5 shall be notified by the
Board of Appeals in writing over the signature of the Chairman of the Board of Appeals that:
809.6.1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in
greatly increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 per $100 of
insurance coverage; and,
809.6.2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; and,
809.6.3 the applicant agrees in writing that the applicant is fully aware of all the risks inherent in the
use of land subject to flooding, assumes those risks and agrees to indemnify and defend the
municipality against any claims filed against it that are related to the applicant’s decision to
use land located in a floodplain and that the applicant individually releases the municipality
from any claims the applicant may have against the municipality that are related to the use of
land located in a floodplain.
809.7 Appeal Procedure for Administrative and Variance Appeals
809.7.1 An administrative or variance appeal may be taken to the Board of Appeals by an aggrieved
party within thirty days after receipt of a written decision of the Code Enforcement Officer or

receipt of an appeal request.
809.7.4 The person filing the appeal shall have the burden of proof.
809.7.5 The Board of Appeals shall decide all appeals within thirty-five days after the close of the
hearing, and shall issue a written decision on all appeals.
809.7.6 The Board of Appeals shall submit to the Code Enforcement Officer a report of all variance
actions, including justification for the granting of the variance and an authorization for the
Code Enforcement Officer to issue a Flood Hazard Development Permit, which includes any
conditions to be attached to said permit.
809.7.7 Any aggrieved party who participated as a party during the proceedings before the Board of
Appeals may take an appeal to Superior Court in accordance with State laws within forty-five
days from the date of any decision of the Board of Appeals.

reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one foot, and
b. when not designated on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, it is considered to be the
channel of a river or other water course and the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the
width of the floodplain, as measured from the normal high water mark to the upland limit of the
floodplain.
Riverine - means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
Special Flood Hazard Area - see Area of Special Flood Hazard.
Start of Construction - means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, substantial improvement or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of
piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not

structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement - means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the
start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
a. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official
and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
b. Any alteration of a Historic Structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a historic structure, and a variance is obtained from the community’s Board
of Appeals.
Variance - means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation.
Violation - means the failure of a structure or development to comply with a community’s floodplain
management regulations.

for all claims, damages, losses and expenses, including attorney's fees, arising out of or resulting from
owner's work. The Town shall have the right to select its own attorney at the owner's expense.
903 - SEWER EXTENSION PROCEDURES
903.1 - PUBLIC SEWER EXTENSION BY TOWN
Public sewer extensions may be constructed by the Town, if, in the opinion of the Selectboard, the
number of existing, improved properties to be served by such extension warrants its costs or if such
extension is likely to provide adequate revenues to warrant its cost in the reasonable future.
903.2 – TOWN EXTENSION INITIATED
The Selectboard, after study, may elect to extend public sewers into areas that meet the above criteria or
when extension is required by specific state or federal mandate or when property owners(s), builder(s)
or developer(s) have proposed sewer extensions within the Town property or road right-of-way or
easement to the Town by written petition filed with the Selectboard.
903.3 – APPROVAL OF TOWN EXTENSION
Prior to authorizing a sewer extension greater than 500 feet by the Town, except by specific state or
federal mandate, the Selectboard shall:
1. Notify the Town of Thomaston Planning Board in order to assure conformity with the
comprehensive plans and other public policies relating to the Town’s growth and
development.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 9, Sewer Ordinance
Chapter 9 – Page 8
2. Notify all abutting property owners to the proposed sewer extension not less than 10 days
prior to the meeting at which they will take final action on the authorization of the extension.
3. Publish notice of the proposed action in a newspaper with general circulation in the Town not
less than 7 days prior to the meeting at which they will take final action on the authorization of
the extension.
903.4 – FINANCING A TOWN EXTENSION
The costs associated with such extensions may be borne by the benefited property owners in a manner
determined by the Selectboard to prevent unreasonable increases in the bonded indebtedness of the
Town. In addition, each owner connecting into the public sewer system must obtain a written
connection permit from the Town and pay the Sewer System Development Charge (SSDC) and any
other charges associated with the connection.
903.5 – PROCEDURE FOR TOWN EXTENSION
The Town may acquire any property or easements needed, contract for the design and construction and
perform any other tasks necessary to install the sewer extension. All extensions constructed under this
section shall comply with Section 903.20 “Sewer Design Standards” and Section 903.25 “New Sewer
Testing”.
903.6 - PUBLIC SEWER EXTENSION IN SPECIAL SEWER ZONE
The Selectboard may establish a Special Sewer Zone comprising all non-sewered lots of benefiting
property owners to a proposed sewer extension.
903.7 – SPECIAL SEWER ZONE EXTENSION INITIATED
Property owners(s), builder(s) or developer(s) may petition the Selectboard to establish a Special Sewer
Zone for the purpose of extending the public sewer within the Town property or road right-of-way or
easement of the Town.
903.8 – APPROVAL OF SPECIAL SEWER ZONE EXTENSION
Prior to establishing a Special Sewer Zone and authorizing any sewer extension the Selectboard shall:
1. Notify the Town of Thomaston Planning Board in order to assure conformity with the
comprehensive plans and other public policies relating to the Town’s growth and
development.
2. Notify all abutting property owners to the proposed sewer extension by registered mail not less
than 10 days prior to the meeting at which they will take final action on the authorization of
the extension.
3. Publish notice of the proposed action in a newspaper with general circulation in the Town not
less than 7 days prior to the meeting at which they will take final action on the authorization of
the extension.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 9, Sewer Ordinance
Chapter 9 – Page 9
903.9 – FINANCING A SPECIAL SEWER ZONE EXTENSION
Extensions to the sewer collection system provide benefits by increasing the area served by public
sewers, spreading the cost of safely treating and disposing of wastewater among more users and helping
to protect the Georges River and its watershed. However, existing buildings along the proposed sewer
route may have working septic systems and not need public sewer at the time the sewer is installed.
There may be vacant lots that are not built on until years after the sewer is installed. To promote the
benefits of expanding the public sewer service area the Town may establish a Special Sewer Zone and
provide funding, or not, as necessary to install a public sewer. To reimburse the Town, or others, for a
portion of the sewer extension expense the Selectboard may establish a Special Assessment for each
owner within the zone to be paid at the time of connecting into the public sewer. This Special
Assessment must be paid before the owner can obtain a written connection permit from the Town and is
in addition to the Sewer System Development Charge (SSDC) and any other charges associated with the
connection.
903.10 – PROCEDURE FOR SPECIAL SEWER ZONE EXTENSION
The Town may acquire any property or easements needed, contract for the design and construction and
perform any other tasks necessary to install the sewer extension. All extensions constructed under this
section shall comply with Section 903.20 “Sewer Design Standards” and Section 903.25 “New Sewer
Testing”.
903.11 - PUBLIC SEWER EXTENSION BY OTHERS
If the Selectboard does not elect to construct a public sewer extension the property owners(s), builder(s),
or developer(s) may construct the necessary public sewer extension if the Selectboard in accordance
with the requirements of Section 903.12 approves such extension.
903.12 – APPROVAL OF PUBLIC SEWER EXTENSION BY OTHERS
Prior to authorizing a sewer extension greater than 500 feet the Selectboard shall:
1. Notify the Town of Thomaston Planning Board in order to assure conformity with the
comprehensive plans and other public policies relating to the Town’s growth and
development.
2. Notify all abutting property owners to the proposed sewer extension not less than 10 days
prior to the meeting at which they will take final action on the authorization of the extension.
3. Publish notice of the proposed action in a newspaper with general circulation in the Town not
less than 7 days prior to the meeting at which they will take final action on the authorization of
the extension.
903.13 – FINANCING EXTENSIONS BY OTHERS

connection to the public sewer shall be made. Any funds remaining in the escrow account after the
Town has paid all of the expense for review and inspection of the sewer extension shall be returned to
the owner, builder or developer.
903.14 – PROCEDURE FOR EXTENSION BY OTHERS
Design of sanitary sewers shall be as specified in Section 903.20. The design of sewers and pump stations
to be deeded to the Town shall anticipate and allow for all possible future system extensions or
developments within the future drainage areas as established by the Town. The Selectboard's decisions
or the decisions of its representative shall be final in matters of quality and methods of construction. The
owner(s), builder(s), developer(s) or their successor in interest shall warranty the public sewer extension
and pay for all operations, maintenance, corrections and repair costs for one year after acceptance by the
Town. In order to ensure that all operations, maintenance, corrections and repair costs are paid by the
owner, builder or developer, a one-year maintenance guarantee as specified in Section 903.15 may be
required by the Town.
903.15 – OWNERSHIP OF NEW SEWERS
All extensions of public sewers constructed at the expense of property owner(s), builder(s) or
developer(s), after approval and acceptance by the Town, shall become the property of the Town and
shall thereafter be maintained by the Town. The property owner(s), builder(s) or developer(s), shall, for
all sewers, pump stations and appurtenances not in a public right-of-way, and before acceptance,
provide, by deed free and clear of encumbrances or by easement to the Town, right or title to the sewers,
pump stations and appurtenances including access from a public right-of-way.
Said sewers, after their acceptance by the Town, shall be guaranteed against defects in materials or
workmanship for twelve (12) months, the guarantee being in a form stipulated by the Selectboard. At
the sole discretion of the Selectboard, a completion bond or certified check may be demanded as part of
the guarantee.
903.16 - PRIVATE SEWER EXTENSION
All private sewer extensions on private property that discharge or connect to the public sanitary sewer
shall be approved by the Selectboard prior to construction. Excluded from this requirement are building
drains and building sewers. The Selectboard may approve a private sewer extension if plans and
specifications, properly designed by an engineer registered in the State of Maine and conforming to
design standards set out in this regulation, are submitted sixty (60) days before the regularly scheduled
meeting at which Selectboard approval of the extension will be requested.
903.17 – APPROVAL OF PRIVATE SEWER EXTENSIONS

and the Town's consulting engineer in reviewing and approving the plans and specifications and
performing the inspection work shall be paid from an escrow deposit made by the property owner(s),
builder(s) or developer(s) to the Town at the time of application to the Selectboard. The amount of the
deposit shall be 2% of the estimated cost of the extension. If the expenses exceed the amount of the 2%
escrow account, the extra expense shall be levied against the property owner, builder or developer.
Failure to pay the extra expenses will result in the disapproval of the application and no physical
connection to the public sewer shall be made. Any funds remaining in the escrow account after the
Town has paid all of the expense for review and inspection of the sewer extension shall be returned to
the owner, builder or developer.
903.19 – PROCEDURE FOR PRIVATE SEWER EXTENSION
Design of sanitary sewers shall be as specified in Section 903.5. The design of sewers and pump stations
shall anticipate and allow for all possible future system extensions or developments within the future
drainage areas as established by the Town. The Selectboard's decisions or the decisions of its
representative shall be final in matters of quality and methods of construction. The owner(s), builder(s),
developer(s) or their successor in interest shall pay for all operations, maintenance, corrections and
repair costs to the private sewer extension. None of these costs will be borne by the Town of Thomaston.
Prior to the actual physical connection of the private sewer extension to the public sewer, the person,
builder or developer must obtain a sewer connection permit and pay the Sewer System Development
Charge to the Town or else no physical connection to the public sewer shall be made.
903.20 – SEWER SYSTEM DESIGN STANDARDS

Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 9, Sewer Ordinance
Chapter 9 – Page 13
903.24 – PUMP STATION DESIGN CRITERIA
The Town has standardized the pump stations owned by the Town such that controls and alarms are the
same in all stations and that pumps and standby generators in stations of similar size are the same. New
pump stations shall, whenever possible, be designed with the same manufacturers equipment as is used
in existing stations of similar size. When a pump of a different size or manufacturer that is currently in
use is used in a new station a third or spare pump shall be provided.
All stations shall have control systems with double backup such that if the primary control fails the
controller will continue to cycle on the same schedule as it was on when it failed and if that fails the
high-high water alarm will turn on (and off) at least one pump through a float independent of the
primary controller.
All pump stations shall have either standby power capable of operating the station for a minimum of
three (3) days without outside power or a wet well sized to hold a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours
of flow at maximum design above the high-high water alarm level.
903.25 - SEWER TESTING & CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS
All public sewers, force mains and manholes shall pass a final test before the extension will be approved
and building sewer connections allowed by the Town. All testing shall be done in the presence of the
Town’s representative.
If leakage exceeds the specific amount allowed by any test, the necessary repairs or replacements
required shall be made and the test repeated until leakage is permanently reduced to within the specified
limit.
903.26 – SEWER TEST
All gravity sewer lines shall be tested by a low pressure exfiltration air test. All sewer lines shall be
cleaned to remove all sediment and debris prior to testing. Test plugs shall be properly installed
blocking both ends of the pipe and air introduced through a mechanism in one of the air lock units to a
minimum of four (4) pounds per square inch pressure. The air source shall then be shut off. A pressure
drop, from the applied pressure, of less than one (1.0) psi during the period of time specified in the table
below will constitute an acceptable air pressure test. If the pressure drop during the indicated time
interval is exceeded, the test will be determined as a failure. The pipe shall be retested following the
necessary repairs or replacement.
No repairs shall be made internally on the pipe unless specially authorized by the Town. If any pipe is
defective, it shall be removed and replaced. If debris and sediment enters the pipe during repair, the
pipe shall be cleaned again before retesting.
At the option of the Town a deflection test on any PVC sewer lines may be required with a mandrel
assembly (7½%) pulled through the entire length of each sewer run. If a deflection in the diameter of the
pipe equal to or greater than 7½% of the specified pipe diameter is measured, the defective pipe will be
removed and replaced. The pipe shall then be re-tested until found to be satisfactory.

after approval and acceptance by the Superintendent, shall become the property of the town and shall
thereafter be maintained by the
If the manhole fails the initial test, necessary repairs shall be made with a non-shrink grout while the
vacuum is still being drawn. Retesting shall proceed until a satisfactory test is obtained.
903.28 – FORCE MAIN TEST
All force mains shall be water-pressure tested. Because of serious safety hazards air-pressure testing is
not allowed. All force mains shall be cleaned by flushing to remove all sediment and debris prior to
testing. The force main shall be satisfactorily valved or capped on each end and slowly filled with water.
All air must be expelled from the pipe. Pressure shall be applied to the pipe by means of a pump
connected to the pipe until a minimum of one hundred (100) pounds per square inch is reached. The
duration of the pressure test shall be one (1) hour and water shall be added during that time to maintain
the pressure within five (5±) psi of the initial pressure.
Leakage shall be defined as the quantity of water that must be supplied into the new force main to
maintain pressure within five (5) psi of the initial pressure and acceptance shall be determined on the
basis of allowable leakage.
Allowable leakage from the force main shall be as specified in the table below:

interceptors shall be of a type tan capacity approved by the Superintendent, and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
In maintaining these interceptors the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal
by legal and environmentally safe methods of the captured material and shall maintain records of the
date, name of hauler, quantity hauled, and means of disposal. Signed copies of these records shall be
submitted every 6 months to the Superintendent. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials
not performed by owner(s) personnel shall be performed by state licensed waste disposal firms.
NEW DISCHARGE NOTIFICATION
The Board shall require forty-five (45) days notification of any new proposed discharge having a daily
flow greater than 2 percent of the average daily flow of the Town's facilities. In addition, a change in
volume or character of wastewater greater than twenty (20) percent of the present flow or load, shall
require said notification.

BYPASS METER POLICY
Sewer user fees in Thomaston are based on water usage as measured by the buildings incoming water
meter. The readings from that meter are provided to the town by the Camden-Rockland Water Co. The
town recognizes that not all water purchased by the user goes to the public sewer. To compensate for
this the user may, at their expense, purchase and install a bypass meter on any source of water that does
not go into the public sewer. The water that passes through this bypass meter may be deducted from the
total water use for sewer billing purposes.
The procedure for installing and using a bypass meter is as follows:
1. The bypass meter can be installed on any water line that does not discharge any portion of its
flow to the public sewer.
2. The owner must purchase and install the bypass meter. A list of suppliers is shown below.
3. The owner must notify the Town Office either in writing or by phone (354-6107 that the meter
is installed and ready to be used. The CEO will then inspect and approve the installation.
4. At the end of each calendar quarter the owner must submit the readings from the bypass meter
to the town.
NOTE: The town will try to send a reminder to the owner each quarter but the reporting
responsibility is with the owner and not the town.
5. The town may deduct the bypass water meter reading from the total water used before the
sewer bills are calculated.
Sources for bypass meters are as follows:
E.J. Prescott Co., Gardiner, Me; phone no. 582-2006
George Caldwell Co., Stoughton, MA; phone no. 1-800-695-4101.
Both firms will ship meters C.O.D. A 5.8 water meter costs between $40.00 to $60.00.

SEWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGES
(S.S.D.C.)
AUTHORITY
The following charges are established as provided by the Sewer Ordinance of the Town of Thomaston,
901.5.
INTRODUCTION
Increased residential, commercial and industrial development within the Town of Thomaston has
created a need to undertake capital improvements to the existing wastewater facilities to accommodate
and treat the increased wastewater flow directly produced and generated by this increased
development. These capital improvements have created a cost which is separate and distinct from
normal maintenance and upgrading repairs which benefits existing users.
In order to assess these capital improvement costs for increasing capacity fairly and equitably among
those creating this demand the Town hereby established a Sewer System Development Charge
(S.S.D.C.). The proceeds from this charge are to be applied solely towards the overall capital costs of
financing the necessary capital improvements and capital equipment purchases to increase the capacity
of the wastewater facilities.
An A.A.D.C. is the new or expanded municipal sewer users proportional cost of increasing the capacity
of the wastewater collection, pumping and treatment system which benefits the new or expanded user.
This charge is separate and distinct from the physical connection costs, the sewer rate, other sewer fees
and any sewer extension costs. The S.S.D.c. is the fee for a sewer connection permit and is a one-time
charge.
CHARGE CALCULATIONS
The S.S.D.C., which is the sewer connection permit fee, shall be due any payable by the property owner
prior to the issuance of a sewer connection permit for any new of additional expanded construction,
renovation or change in use that will be connected to an existing or proposed municipal sanitary sewer.
The S.S.D.C. shall also be charged when there is an additional wastewater flow to the collection and
treatment facilities resulting from new or expanded construction, renovation or change in use and no
new physical sewer connection is involved and there already an existing sewer connection. The S.S.D.C.
in this case shall be based on the difference between the existing calculated flows and the proposed
calculated flows. The S.S.D.C. shall not apply to a single family lining unit that is not changed from a
single family living unit by renovation or expansion.
The S.S.D.C. charge shall be established by the Selectmen and shall be based upon the gallons of daily
flow of wastewaters projected to be generated by each use as established in design criteria of the Maine
Department of Human Services, State Plumbing Code, Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules.
Residential rates shall be determined by using the minimum flow calculations in the Code except as
allowed in the next paragraph. The S.S.D.C. shall be calculated and determined by the Code
Enforcement Officer (C.E.O.). The wastewater flow of any use not included in this Code shall be
determined by the C.E.O.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 9, Sewer Ordinance
Chapter 9 – Page 33
Residential dwelling units in which water conserving fixtures, meeting or exceeding the standards
below, are permanently installed shall be allowed to reduce the daily flow figure by 1/3 and pay an
S.S.D.C. based on the lower figure. Non-residential users may install water conserving fixtures any
reduction in the S.S.D.C. will be considered on a case by case basis.
Standards for water conserving fixtures:
Low flush toilets - maximum 1.6 gallons per flush;
Low flow shower heads - maximum 2.5 gallons per minute.
It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide proof that proposed fixtures meet these
standards.
An applicant applying to expand wastewater generation within an existing residential dwelling unit(s)
may claim a credit for converting existing fixtures to water conserving fixtures. In no event shall the
credit claim exceed the S.S.D.C.
The S.S.D.C. may not be the only cost the property owner will pay for a connection to the public sewer
or for adding additional sewage flow to the sewer system. The Town under the sewer ordinance may
assess fees for inspection, connection, sewer extension and others.
PERMIT
Upon approval, the Board of Selectmen shall give the applicant a written permit to enter and connect
with the public sewer. This permit is available to the owner of the land described in the application, the
owner's heirs and assigns, and shall run with the land. Failure to enter and connect into the public seer
within one year from the date of granting the permit shall result in the expiration of the permit and
forfeiture of the permit fee or the S.S.D.C. Renewal of a permit shall be treated as a new application and
shall be subject to all of the provisions of this ordinance including the appropriate fees and charges.
The S.S.D.C. may be refunded, upon request of the owner, under the following conditions:
1. No portion of the permit has been used;
2. The permit is still valid as of the date a written request for refund is received;
3. A 20% administrative charge is deducted from any refund.
MUNICIPAL PROPERTY EXEMPT
The S.S.D.C. shall not apply to the treatment of any wastewater flow from property owned by the Town
of Thomaston including tax-acquired property. Other tax-exempt properties such as public or private
schools or institutions shall be charged an S.S.D.C.
S.S.D.C. FUND
All S.S.D.C. fees collected shall be paid into a special interest bearing Capital Dedication Reserve
Account of the Town or into a special sinking fund account for debt service payment as determined by
the Selectmen. Accounting practices shall identify the amounts paid in by each person or firm and the
amounts expended for system development. Expenditures shall be tracked on a first-paid, first-spent
basis. The use of the special capital Dedicated Reserve Account or sinking fund account shall be clearly
shown in the Town's annual audit.
Monies collected from the S.S.D.C. shall be used solely to finance increases in the wastewater facilities
capacity including but not limited to the following:

capacity of the Town Wastewater facilities.
The funds may not be used to finance routine maintenance and repair activities or other expenses solely
related to operation of the wastewater system.
Any S.S.D.c., or portion thereof, paid into the fund, if not expended within ten (ten) years of payment
shall be refunded with interest to the person or firm who paid the fee or his successor in interest.
SCHEDULE OF CHARGES
The S.S.D.C. shall be based on the Town of Thomaston, Sewer System Evaluation Report, done by
Wright-Pierce Engineers and dated June 1990. table 9 of this report is a prioritized list of twenty-two (22)
recommended sewer system improvements projects. The total estimated cost (in 1990 dollars) is
$5,978,750 and the total estimated removable peak instantaneous flow is 1,837,274 gallons. The average
cost per gallon of clean water removed is $3.25. Based on normal removal ratio of 5 to 1 require by DEP
in other communities (the 10 to ratio require in the Consent Agreement expires October 1992) a gallon of
capacity in Thomaston's wastewater facilities will cost $16.25 in 1990 dollars. An allowance of 5% per
year has been added to cover normal construction cost increases in future years.

TOWN OF THOMASTON
SEWER MONITORING PROGRAM
SEWER USE VIOLATION MONITORING PLAN
AUTHORITY
The following plan is established as provided by the Sewer Ordinance of the Town of Thomaston,
Section 901.4.
INTRODUCTION
A significant portion of the total I & I reaching the Wastewater Treatment Plant comes from the private
portion of the collection system. Some of this is intentional such as sump pumps, and some of it is
unintentional such as groundwater leaking into building sewers. For many years this private I & I was
overlooked for two reasons: first, it was not believed by many people to be as large a portion of the
problem as it is, and second, it was believed that little or nothing could be done about it. Today,
however, both of these may have been dispelled.
Thomaston's sewer Ordinance prohibits any source of unpolluted water from being connected to the
sanitary sewer. No sump pumps, roof drains, cellar drains, foundation drains or any other unpolluted
waters are permitted. This is fairly easy to control with a new building. However, just as the town has to
upgrade its public sewers, so the private owners must look at their situation and assert that they are also
in compliance with the Sewer Ordinance. Just because a building has been connected to the sewer for
many years does not exempt them from compliance.
This plan outlines a step by step program to bring as may sewer users as possible into full compliance
with the Sewer Ordinance. Just because a building has been connected to the sewer for many years does
not exempt them from compliance.
This plan outlines a step by step program to bring as may sewer users as possible into full compliance
with the Sewer Ordinance and to try to do this by working with people and not against them.
1990-1992 RECONSTRUCTION
Each structure generating wastewater and adjoining a section of the sewer scheduled for reconstruction
as shown on the map entitled "Preliminary Plan Thomaston Sewer Replacement" as prepared by T. Y.
Lin Consulting Engineers of Falmouth, shall be inspected by the C.E.O. or his agent. This inspection
shall, as a minimum, determine the following:
. location of existing building drain and building sewer; . location of proposed building sewer; .
necessary basement elevations; . if the structure is in violation of the Sewer Ordinance (Section 902.14
polluted Waters).
Prior to any visit, a letter with similar format to the one shown as Appendix A of the plan shall be sent
to each structure owner. The written record of the inspection shall be forwarded to the engineers
designing the project. Provision shall be made to handle unpolluted water in the design stage in the
order shown below:
. if possible a new sanitary sewer and sanitary building sewer shall be provided so that the existing
building sewer may remain as a storm drain. This new sanitary building sewer should enter the
basement several feet above the basement floor to prevent its use as a basement drain; . or, if the existing
sewer cannot be converted to a storm drain then a new separate storm drain should also be installed to
each building and connected to an existing storm sewer or ditch or natural watercourse.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 9, Sewer Ordinance
Chapter 9 – Page 36
In any event, esigned construction shall ensure that only sanitary wastewater enters the sanitary sewer
and that unpolluted water has an acceptable outlet from each building directly effected by the
construction project.
When the house sewer is being installed it shall be inspected by the C.E.O. as provided by Section 902.9
of the Sewer Ordinance. This inspection shall ensure that all portions of the Sewer Ordinance are
complied with including Section 902.14 unpolluted water. A copy of the form used for approving the
installation is shown as Appendix C. This is the same form used for approval to reconnect. On the back
of this form a sketch will be made, with ties, of the new house service line.
NON-RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY
The work outlined in this section shall be substantially completed by the end of 1992. The C.E.O. shall
prepare a list of all structures meeting the following criteria:
. The structure can generate wastewater; . the structure is connected to the public sewer in Thomaston
(including East Thomaston). . The building sewer is not scheduled for replacement under the 1990-1992
reconstruction as described in 1990-1992 Reconstruction of this plan,
Each structure on this list shall be inspected by the C.E.O. or his agent during periods of maximum
groundwater levels. This is approximately March through May in the spring.
Prior to inspection a notice shall be sent to each owner and/or tenant of similar format to the one shown
in Appendix D. This inspection shall determine if the structure is in compliance (or not in compliance)
with Section 902.14 of the Sewer Ordinance. As a minimum, the inspection shall determine if the
structure has any; sump pumps, roof runoff, cellar drainage or other unpolluted water connected to th
public sanitary sewer. A written record of each inspection shall be made on a form such as shown in
Appendix E. information on foundation drains should be gathered if possible, but they cannot be
removed until the town replaces the building sewer.
The C.E.O. shall notify the owner of any structure found to be in violation of the Sewer Ordinance in
writing within 10 working days of the inspection. The format shall be similar to the model in Appendix
E. Each situation shall be followed up until compliance with the Sewer Ordinance is obtained.
NEW CONNECTION INSPECTION
Each new structure before connecting to the public sewer must make out an Application for Sanitary
Sewer Connection Permit. Once this is approved and the building sewer is installed, the line and the
connection to the public sewer must be inspected by the C.E.O. to record the inspection. There is also
space to note here that a check of the structure has been made to insure compliance with Section 902.14
Unpolluted Water. The back of this form is also used to make a sketch with ties of the location of the
new house sewer. Should part of the plumbing not be complete at the time of inspection the C.E.O. shall
revisit the site at a later date to check for compliance with the Sewer Ordinance.
LONG TERM MONITORING
In the spring of each year thereafter, during the wettest time of the year, a portion of the sanitary
collection system should be inspected by TV cameras. It is suggested that several thousand feet be
televised each year. This way the whole system could be looked at each five or six years. This inspection
is for two purposes. First to ensure that the private property excess water removal plan is being adhered
to, and second to check the main sewer lines for leaks, broken pipes, and other problems.
Because part of the reason for televising is to inspect the main sewer pipe itself, it would make more
sense to start this work on the sections of sewer not replaced in the Capital Improvement Program.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 9, Sewer Ordinance
Chapter 9 – Page 37
Since the major objective of this program is to remove excess water, not charge people a surcharge for it,
a warning letter should be sent to anyone found to be in violation. A suggested form is shown in letter F.
Anyone who does not correct the problem in the allowed time, however, will have the added charge.
Even if the problem is corrected immediately after the surcharge is added, it must be paid for a full year.
If the problem is not corrected by the time of the next inspection, the surcharge will continue for another
year.

SEWER MONITORING PROGRAM
SANITARY SEWER OPERATIONS PLAN
AUTHORITY
The following plan is established as provided by the Sewer Ordinance of the Town of Thomaston,
Section 901.4.
INTRODUCTION & GOALS
In order to protect the substantial investment the Town has made in a modern wastewater collection
system and to keep the system in a condition whereby it will meet the goals outlined below, this
operational plan has been established for the maintenance and management of the Town’s sanitary
sewer system. The function of this collection system is to collect, contain and transport wastewater to a
point of treatment. The goals of this plan are:
• Prevent public health hazards;
• Protect the Town’s investment by maximizing the useful life and capacity of the
system;
• Prevent unnecessary damage;
• Convey wastewater with minimum inflow, infiltration and exfiltration;
• Perform all activities safely and avoid injury.
OPERATIONAL CONTROL
The Town of Thomaston operates three drainage systems for the benefits of its citizens:
SYSTEM PURPOSE
SANITARY Collect and convey to treatment polluted wastewater.
CLEAN WATER Convey cellar drains, sump pump discharge and other clean water
from building to receiving waters.
STORM WATER Collect and convey rainwater from streets to receiving waters.
NOTE: MDOT is responsible for State highways storm water.
The Pollution Control Department (PCD) shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of the
sanitary sewers and shall work with the Public Works Department (PWD) as outlined in sections below.
PWD shall be completely responsible for all clean water drains and all storm drains except for those
owned by MDOT.
PCD RESPONSIBILITY
PCD shall be solely responsible for:
• Keeping the sanitary sewer mapping up-to-date and seeing to it that current copies of
overall plans are available at both the Town Office and the PWD Office.
Thomaston Ordinances, Chapter 9, Sewer Ordinance
Chapter 9 – Page 39
• Arranging for all planning, design and construction (with the approval of the Board)
of all major repairs, replacements and extensions to the sanitary sewer system.
NOTE: consideration shall be given to using the PWD for construction work.
• Providing video inspection and smoke testing as needed to check condition of lines,
leakage problems, problem areas or ther reasons.
• Monitoring flows as needed to check for infiltration or illegal sewer use.
PWD RESPONSIBILITY
PWD shall be solely responsible for:
• Emergency calls such as plugs sewers, holes in pavement and calls from sewer users.
JOINT RESPONSIBILITY
PWD and PCD shall work together in the following areas:
• Regular inspection and maintenance PCD shall coordinate inspections with PWD and
the regular annual maintenance program shall be agreed to by both Departments
before budgets are approved. Performance of the regular maintenance shall be done
by PWD with assistance from PCD.
• Policies covering public relations shall be developed by PCD (with approval from
PWD and the board) and administered by both departments.
• A system for record keeping shall be set up by the PCD and both departments shall
follow this system. Data shall be assembled by PCD with regular summaries made
available to PWD.
• Training shall be coordinated between both departments with the goal of having all
personnel involved in sewer work trained. All personnel shall be certified for the
work they perform.
• Minor repairs and improvements to the sanitary sewer system such as rebuilding
manhole tops, repairing manhole channels and patching around manholes. PWD shall
perform such work if possible.
FUNDING
Funding for the operation and maintenance of the sanitary sewer system shall be paid for by PCD for
items that are listed herein that are PCD’s responsibility and by PWD for items contained herein that are
PWD’s responsibility. Funding for major sewer line replacement or extension may come from other
sources (i.e.: grants, loans, etc.) if approved by the Town. Items contained herein that are under joint
responsibility will be paid for by the Department performing the work. The two departments will be
responsible for coordinating the planning and scheduling in sufficient time to include necessary funds in
their respective annual budgets.
In the event the two departments cannot agree on responsibility the Town manager shall resolve the
questions.
