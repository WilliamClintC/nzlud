BIG BEAR LAKE MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances 
of the City of Big Bear Lake, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 8, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
 
PREFACE 
The Big Bear Lake, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1984, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 8, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Alvin Beardsley, city attorney. 
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 8, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2018-463, passed July 9, 2018.

\HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are "Reserved" for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 8, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 8, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 8, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System." (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "Reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage the submission of ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. We prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

The amount of the fine for failure to correct the violation shall increase at the rate specified in section 1.17.030 or as specified by a separate resolution of the city council.

3.20.020 - Definitions. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter: 
A.  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied, intended or designed for use or occupancy by transients, including but not limited to dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house, or portion thereof, duplex, triplex, single-family dwelling units, except any private dwelling house or other individually owned single-family dwelling unit rented only occasionally (infrequently) and incidentally to the normal occupancy by the owner or his/her family; provided, that the burden of establishing that the housing or facility is not a hotel as defined herein shall be upon the owner or operator thereof, who shall file with the tax administrator such information as the tax administrator may require, to establish and maintain such status. 
B.  "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room, rooms or any portion thereof offered for rent for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, regardless of the purpose for which such rooms are rented. 
C.  "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgage in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his/her functions through a managing agent of any type or character, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter, and shall have jointly and severally the same duties and liabilities as his/her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
D.  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
E.  "Rent" means the amount of the consideration charged or chargeable to the tenant for the occupancy of space, valued in money whether received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including in full value of receipts, cash, credits, property or services of any kind or nature, without any deduction whatsoever. It is not the intent of this subsection to make the operator liable for the tax on uncollected rent. However, uncollected rent must be reported. 
F.  "Tax administrator" means the city manager or his designated agent. 
G.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient if his actual total period of occupancy does not exceed thirty days.

In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of the determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.

The claims shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the person or credited to rent subsequently payable by the person to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once erroneously, or illegally collected or received by the city, by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

All persons, upon receipt of the notice, shall advise the city immediately of all such credits, other personal property or debts in their possession, under their control or owing by them. If such notice seeks to prevent the transfer or other disposition of a deposit in a bank, or other credits or personal property in the possession or under the control of the bank, to be effective the notice shall be delivered or mailed to the branch or office of such bank at which such deposit is carried or at which such credits or personal property is held.

(Ord. 82-72 § 1(part), 1982)  
5.08.050 - Application—Investigation by health officer. 
Upon receipt of a completed application, the health officer shall conduct an investigation to determine if the public health, safety, welfare, convenience and necessity require the granting of an original or additional permit for the ambulance service area for which the application has been made and shall further determine if the applicant meets all requirements of this chapter. Upon completion of his investigation, the health officer shall recommend to the city council that a permit be granted or denied for the ambulance service area. No permit shall be issued by the health officer until the city council has determined that the public health, safety, welfare, convenience and necessity require the granting of such permit for the particular ambulance service area. 
(Ord. 82-72 § 1(part), 1982)  
5.08.060 - Permit—Issuance or denial. 
A.  The city council may order the issuance of a permit to conduct an ambulance service in a specified area upon finding that the public health, safety, welfare, convenience and necessity require the availability of such ambulance service and that the applicant meets all requirements of this chapter. 
B.  The city council may order the denial of a permit on the ground of infeasibility. Whenever a new application is filed under the provisions of this chapter for a permit to provide ambulance service in the city where services already exist, the council, after due investigation, may find and determine, as a matter of fact, that there does not exist in the area sufficient potential need for ambulance service to justify the granting of an additional separate and distinct permit for use within that ambulance service area. Predicated on such findings, the city council may deny the application for permit on the grounds that the granting of such new permit is not economically or financially feasible and not in the public interest and welfare. 
C.  The city council may order the denial or revocation of a permit if the applicant or any partner, officer or director thereof: 
1.  Was previously the holder of a permit issued under the ordinance which permit has been revoked or not reissued and the terms or conditions of the suspension have not been fulfilled or corrected; 
2.  Is committing any act, which, if committed by any permittee, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a permit issued pursuant to this chapter; 
3.  Has committed any act involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit whereby another is injured or where the applicant has benefited; 
4.  Has acted in the capacity of a permitted person or firm under this chapter without having a permit therefore; 
5.  Has entered a plea of guilty to, or been found guilty of, or been convicted of a felony, or a crime involving moral turpitude, and the time for appeal has elapsed or the judgment of conviction has been affirmed on appeal, irrespective of an order granting probation following such conviction suspending the imposition of sentence, or of a subsequent order under the provisions of Section 1203.4 of the Penal Code allowing such person to withdraw his plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty, or setting aside the plea or verdict of guilty, or dismissing the accusation of information. 
D.  Bonding of Applicant. Before any permit is issued under the provisions of this chapter, the council shall require the applicant as a condition to the issuance of the permit to post with the clerk of the council a surety bond in the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars or a surety bond in the same amount furnished by a corporation authorized to do business in the state, payable to the city. The bond shall be conditioned upon the full and faithful performance by the permittee of his obligations under the applicable provision of this chapter and shall be kept in full force and effect by the permittee throughout the life of the permit and all renewals thereof. The council, upon recommendation of the department, from time to time may by resolution establish such additional or lower bond requirement for individual permittees as may be deemed necessary in the event it is determined the foregoing bond requirements constitute insufficient or more than sufficient protection to the city, as the case may be. The bond requirement may be waived by the city council if public need and necessity require it. 
E.  Liability Insurance. The permittee shall obtain and keep in force during the term of the permit public liability and bodily injury insurance issued by a company authorized to do business in the state, insuring the owner, and also naming the city as an additional insured of such ambulance against loss by reason of injury or damage that may result to persons or property from negligent operation of defective construction of such ambulance or from violation of this chapter or of any other law of the state or the United States. The policy shall be in the sum of not less than two hundred thousand dollars for personal injury to or death of any one person in any single accident; and the limits of each such vehicle shall not be less than one hundred thousand dollars for damages to or destruction of property in any one accident. Workers compensation insurance shall be carried covering all employees of the permit holder. Before the health officer issues a permit, copies of the policies or certificates evidencing such policies shall be filed with the department. All policies shall contain a provision requiring a thirty-day notice to be given to the department prior to cancellation, modification or reduction in limits. The amounts of public liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage shall be subject to review and adjustment at the council's option. 
(Ord. 82-72 § 1 (part), 1982)

The city reserves the right to reject a specific policy if its terms, definitions and exclusions prohibit or diminish coverage and liability as required by this chapter.

5.20.225 - Additional requirements for insurance policies.

Insurers shall have no right of recovery or subrogation against city except in matters of sole negligence on the part of the city, as finally adjudicated, (including its officers, boards and board members, commissions and commission members, employees, volunteers, and other agents and agencies); it shall be the intention of the city and the franchisee that the insurance policies so effected shall protect both parties and be primary coverage for any and all losses covered by the above described insurance.

B.  Any action or proceeding instituted by any franchisee against the city shall be instituted and prosecuted in the appropriate state court for the county of San Bernardino, California. By its acceptance of a franchise agreement and performance thereunder, a franchisee will be deemed to have waived the benefit of any statute or judicial decision (whether of federal or state origin) providing for a change of venue to either another state court or federal district court. The foregoing waiver includes, without implied limitation, any benefits provided to the franchisee pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 394 and all other federal or state statutes of similar effect, including, without implied limitation, any federal statute providing for federal district court jurisdiction due the diversity of citizenship between the city and any franchisee, or due to the fact that a question of federal law is alleged or involved. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2(, 1998)  
ARTICLE VIII. - LIQUIDATED DAMAGES 
 
5.20.235 - The city reserves the right to assess liquidated damages. 
In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the city, the city reserves the right to assess on behalf of its citizens and the franchisee's subscribers liquidated damages in the event of a failure to comply with any time or performance requirements, or breach of a term or condition of such franchise, of his cable service provider chapter, or of any federal, state or local law or regulation pertaining to the provision of cable service, which failure has not been remedied following procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.240 - Parties shall agree to specific liquidated damages to be paid by franchisee for certain delays or nonperformance. 
Upon preparation and acceptance of a franchise agreement, a franchisee shall indicate it understands that failure to comply with any time and performance requirements, or breach of a term or condition of such franchise, of this cable service provider chapter, or of any federal, state or local law or regulation pertaining to the provision of cable service, as stipulated in the agreement or this chapter will result in damage to the city, and that in certain cases it is and will be impracticable to determine the actual amount of such damage in the event of delay or nonperformance of specified obligations. If the cable administrator elects to assess liquidated damages against the franchisee, such liquidated damages shall constitute the exclusive monetary remedy available to the city, and the city shall be entitled to no other monetary damages with the exception of claims sounding in fraud or tort, or defense and indemnity. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.245 - Liquidated damages—Amounts. 
By acceptance of a franchise agreement, the franchisee understands and agrees that failure to comply with any time and performance requirement as stipulated in the franchise agreement or this chapter, absent good cause, will result in damage to the city. Liquidated damages shall continue to accrue, even during the appeals process, until such day as the liquidated damages payment is actually received by the city or waived by the city, or the appeal is sustained. Failure to pay liquidated damages within the time provided shall be a violation of this chapter and cause to proceed against either the letter of credit or bond or surety provided by the franchisee under the terms of Article XXIII, Sections 5.20.910 through 5.20.930, and Article XXIV, Sections 5.20.935 through 5.20.955. The franchisee shall be charged no more than the following amounts in liquidated damages: 
A.  For failure to complete system construction or reconstruction in accordance with the franchise agreement; one hundred fifty dollars for each day, or part thereof, the deficiency continues, assuming the timely grant to franchisee by the city of all permits and licenses and the supplying of all utilities and other required services to be supplied by the city. 
B.  For failure to provide any data, documents, reports or information required by the franchise for the purpose of franchise monitoring and administration, or for failure to cooperate with the city during an application process or cable system review; fifty dollars for each day, or part thereof, the violation occurs or continues. 
C.  For failure to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system following a written request pursuant to this chapter or the agreement; fifty dollars for each day, or part thereof, that such noncompliance continues. 
D.  For failure to meet the customer service requirements of this chapter or the agreement; up to one hundred dollars for each day, or part thereof, that such noncompliance continues. 
E.  For failure to meet any safety requirements of this chapter or the franchise agreement; one hundred dollars, per failure, for each day, or part thereof, that such noncompliance continues; provided, however, in the case of failures, which do not, as determined by the city, pose a reasonable likelihood of causing bodily injury or property damage if not immediately repaired, the franchisee shall not be subject to the liquidated damages provided for in this subsection if the franchisee demonstrates to the city that it is working promptly, diligently and in good faith to correct such violations within a time frame to be determined by the city. 
F.  For failure to comply with any other section, subsection or provision of this chapter, or a franchise agreement; fifty dollars, per each instance of noncompliance, for each day, or part thereof, that such noncompliance continues.

ARTICLE IX. - PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING LIQUIDATED DAMAGES 
 
5.20.250 - Requirement of notice and opportunity to cure—Reason for suspension of requirement. 
A  The cable administrator shall provide notice and opportunity to cure for any time or performance requirement, or breach of, a term or condition of such franchise, of this cable service provider chapter, or of any federal, state or local law or regulation which the cable administrator deems sufficient to warrant assessment of liquidated damages. Force majeure is a defense to the application of this article. 
B.  Notice and the opportunity to cure shall be in writing, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the franchisee's local place of business or any other place reasonably calculated to provide such notice to the franchisee. The franchisee will be deemed to have cured any default and shall not be subject to the assessment of liquidated damages if the franchisee commences to cure such default within fifteen days from the receipt of the city's written notice and completes such cure within thirty days following commencement or, if such default cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty-day period, the franchisee commences to cure such default within fifteen days from receipt of the city's written notice and diligently prosecutes such cure to completion within sixty days thereafter. 
C.  A notice of intention to assess liquidated damages may be issued concurrently with a notice to cure. If a notice of intention to assess liquidated damages is issued concurrently with a notice to cure, the franchisee understands and agrees that liquidated damages will be accruing at the end of the opportunity to cure period. The notice of intention to assess liquidated damages shall set forth the basis of the assessment, and shall inform the franchisee that liquidated damages will be assessed from the date of the notice, or the end of the opportunity to cure period, whichever is later. 
D.  If the franchisee desires to appeal the cable administrator's assessment of liquidated damages, it may do so in accordance with Article IV, Sections 5.20.125 through 5.20.130. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.255 - Other franchise violations—Procedures for remedying. 
Prior to imposing any penalty or sanction against the franchisee for failure to perform any of its obligations under this chapter or its franchise agreement, other than liquidated damages or termination (for which this section shall not apply), the cable administrator shall give the franchisee notice and opportunity to remedy such failure in accordance with the following procedures: 
A.  Notice and Opportunity to Cure. The cable administrator shall provide the franchisee with written notice specifying the nature of such failure. The franchisee will be deemed to have cured any default if the franchisee commences to cure such default within fifteen days from the receipt of the city's written notice and completes such cure within thirty days following commencement or, if such default cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty day period, the franchisee commences to cure such default within fifteen days from receipt of the city's written notice and diligently prosecutes such cure to completion within sixty days thereafter. 
B.  Penalties and Sanctions for Failure to Comply. In the event the cable administrator finds that the franchisee has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this chapter or the franchisee's franchise agreement, and, further, that the franchisee has not remedied such failure within the period allowed therefor following receipt of written notice from the cable administrator, the cable administrator may impose such penalties or sanctions as are provided for under this chapter or the franchisee's franchise agreement. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
ARTICLE X. - COMPLAINT PROCEDURES 
 
5.20.260 - Supervision and regulation of franchise—Franchisee's attendance at meetings. 
The city may do all things necessary and proper to supervise, inspect, and regulate the construction and operation of cable systems franchised under this chapter and implement complaint procedures. The responsibility for such supervision, inspection and regulation is delegated to the cable administrator who is empowered, among other things, to adjust, settle or compromise any controversy arising from the operations of any franchisee, either on behalf of the city or any subscriber, in accordance with the best interests of the public, provided that any person aggrieved by a decision of the cable administrator may appeal the matter in accordance with this chapter for hearing and determination. The city council always reserves the right to reject or modify the decision of the cable administrator and may adjust, settle or compromise any controversy arising from the operation of a franchisee or from any provision of this chapter. At the request of the cable administrator, franchisees are encouraged to participate in any advisory committee meetings established by the cable administrator relating to cable service provider operations. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.265 - Franchisee to maintain an office or service center within city limits. 
A franchisee shall maintain a business office or customer service center within the city limits which shall be open during the business hours stated in the franchise agreement, and shall maintain a publicly-listed local and a toll-free telephone number and sufficient lines which shall be so operated and staffed to respond to customers in at least five ways: accept payments and resolve billing difficulties; give out and exchange or accept return of converters; schedule service or technician calls (or provide an on-site, toll-free telephone for customers to schedule such service calls); answer subscriber inquiries; and receive complaints and commence the resolution thereof. Subscribers shall be promptly notified of any change of address of such office or of telephone number(s). 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.270 - Repair and maintenance crew to be maintained that is capable of responding to subscriber complaints. 
Franchisee shall maintain sufficient repair and maintenance crews capable of responding to subscriber complaints or requests for service in accordance with subscriber service standards described in this chapter, including, without implied limitation, any state law requirements concerning the same. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2), 1998)  
5.20.275 - Notice to be given subscribers regarding complaint handling procedures. 
A franchisee shall establish procedures for receiving, acting upon, and resolving subscriber complaints in conformance with the requirements of this chapter and the franchisee's franchise agreement. Such procedures shall, at a minimum, contain the procedures set forth in this chapter. Adjustments to a subscriber's billing statement, where appropriate, shall occur in the next statement issued to the subscriber. All complaints will be expeditiously addressed and, if reasonably possible, resolved within the requirements set forth in this chapter. A franchisee shall furnish a notice of such procedures to each subscriber at the time of initial subscription of the cable system, at least annually thereafter, and at any time upon request. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.280 - Cable service complaints to be logged, showing nature and disposition of each complaint. 
Failure to meet the requirements of this section will result in foreseeable damages in an amount specified in Article VIII, Liquidated Damages. The franchisee shall institute a complaint logging procedure as follows: 
A.  The franchisee shall maintain a log of all installation and service requests which require a service call to the subscriber's residence, place of business or other location as set forth in this chapter, together with a log of all complaints received requiring corrective action by the franchisee, whether such complaints are written, telephonic or otherwise. Franchisee's logs shall include the identity and address of the subscriber, the date of the request for installation or service or of the complaint, a description of the nature of the service request or of the complaint, the date of the service request or complaint and a description of any response by franchisee to the service request or corrective action by franchisee to remedy the complaint, together with the report of the service representative dispatched to such service location, if applicable. 
B.  This log shall be available for inspection by the city. Regarding complaints of the same type of problem, which evidence a violation by the franchisee in its obligations under this chapter or its franchise agreement, the city may serve the franchisee with a notice to cure. If no, or inadequate, corrective action is taken by the franchisee, the cable administrator may institute an inspection of the franchisee's system. If such inspection discloses a violation of any requirement of this chapter or the agreement, then the franchisee shall bear the costs of such inspection which are in excess of any liquidated damages assessed by the city for such violation. In the cable administrator's discretion, repeated complaints or lack of corrective action may constitute cause for imposition of liquidated damages and/or termination of the franchisee's franchise. 
C.  Upon request of the cable administrator, the franchisee shall, within ten days after receiving such a request, send a written report to the cable administrator with respect to any such complaint and its disposition. Such report shall provide a full explanation of the investigation, findings and corrective steps taken by the franchisee. 
D.  Franchisee shall keep and retain on file a copy of such subscriber service and complaint logs for a period of one year. The franchisee shall submit to the cable administrator this log, including a summary of the number and nature of requests for installation and service and complaints received as well as their disposition. A copy of the summary shall be completed for each six month period and submitted to city by the thirtieth day of the succeeding month. Copies of complaints received through the mail, together with copies of the franchisee's responses (if any), shall also be retained and made available for inspection in the franchisee's public file for not less than one year following the date of their receipt by the franchisee. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.285 - Outage log to be maintained showing details of service failures. 
A.  A franchisee shall maintain an outage log showing the date, approximate time, location, duration, estimated or actual number of subscribers affected, type and probable cause of all head-end, trunk, or distribution line service failures due to causes other than routine testing or maintenance at reasonable times. Upon request by the city, a copy of such log showing the "reliability criteria" (below) shall be filed with the cable administrator by the tenth day of every month and shall be retained by a franchisee for a period of three years. The franchisee will design, procure, install and maintain its equipment to meet, under normal operating conditions, a monthly average system availability criteria to subscribers of ninety-nine and one-half percent measured as follows: 
100-0.5 	Power 	On—Outage 
	Time 	
100 	ON 	
 
B.  Franchisee may at any time propose a new reliability criteria standard for the city's acceptance. The monthly average system availability criteria set forth above shall not include such outages as are caused by or attributable to failure of electrical power from an electric utility that provides electric service to the city which exceeds the operational capacity of the cable system's backup generator and batteries. Where service interruptions or signal interruptions are the result of loss of electrical power from an electric utility and there are no backup generators or batteries or the backup generators or batteries fail to perform to their rated capacity, then the monthly average system availability criteria set forth above shall include such electrical outages.

(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.295 - Current rate schedule to be filed with city—Thirty days notice required prior to rate change. 
A.  A franchisee, for information purposes, and for the city to ensure nondiscrimination, shall provide the city with a complete schedule of all current basic service and enhanced service rates and charges for cable services, including premium services TV and pay-per-view rates and charges, as of January 1st of every year. 
B.  Thirty days prior to any price changes, the franchisee shall give notice to all affected subscribers of any pricing changes or additional charges, excluding temporary marketing and sales discounts or offers and pay-per-view events, which notice shall clearly state all price increases and/or decreases, provided that such pricing changes or additional charges are within the control of the franchisee. In those cases where such pricing changes or additional charges are not within the control of the franchisee, the franchisee shall provide such notice as is reasonable under the circumstances. 
C.  Forty-five days before any price changes or additional charges are to take effect, a franchisee shall provide the city with a copy of the proposed notification for subscribers. The city may review the text of the notification and comment upon its form and content, provided it does so within five business days following receipt from the franchisee. The final form and content of such notice shall be within the discretion of the franchisee, provided that such notice clearly and accurately identifies any such price changes or additional charges. Nothing in this section shall be construed as diminishing the city's powers to regulate a franchisee's rates for cable service or other communication services. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.300 - Subscriber rates. 
The franchisee agrees that installation (i.e., connection) and service fees shall be uniform as to all city subscribers within the categories (if any) set forth in the renewal proposal. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.305 - Other rate matters. 
A.  The franchisee shall notify the cable administrator and subscribers in writing of any change in rates at least thirty days prior to the change.

C.  Official services purchased by the city will not be subject to a converter deposit; however, the city agrees to report and pay for missing or stolen converters utilized for official services. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.310 - Franchisee to pay city five percent of gross annual revenue as a franchise fee. 
A.  Because the streets and other city rights-of-way which are used by the franchisee in the operation of its cable system within the boundaries of the city are valuable city properties acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to taxpayers, and because the grant to the franchisee to use of such properties is a valuable property right without which the franchisee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and because the city will incur costs in regulating and administering a franchise, and to compensate the city for franchisee's use of the city rights-of-way in which its cable system is located, which compensation may be used by the city: 
1.  To regulate the construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance, use and development of such a system on the city; 
2.  For the costs of regulating and administering a franchise; 
3.  For the development and use of access channels; 
4.  For fair and just compensation for the use of city rights-of-way; and 
5.  To the extent permitted by law, for other purposes whether or not such purposes are related to the regulation of cable systems in the city.

(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.315 - Five percent fee also applies to any person distributing a service over the cable system. 
Consistent with Section 622(h) of the Cable Act, the city shall have the power to require any person, other than a cable service provider, who originates or controls the distribution of any service over the cable system and receives fees for such service, which fees are not received by or transmitted through the cable service provider, to pay the city a fee equal to five percent or the maximum permitted by law, of the gross revenues of such person derived from the distribution of such service over the cable system, less any amounts directly paid to the cable system in compensation for the use of such cable system. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.320 - Franchise fee to be paid quarterly along with statement verifying all collected gross revenues. 
The franchise fee assessed shall be payable quarterly to the city. The franchisee shall file a complete, accurate, and certified statement of all collected gross revenues within the city during the period for which such quarterly payment covers, and such payment shall be made to the city not later than thirty days after the end of each quarter. The franchisee shall also provide annually within ninety days after the end of the fiscal year a report certified by a certified public accountant, who may be an employee of franchisee, verifying all collected gross revenues. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.325 - City may examine all franchisee's records to determine accuracy of amounts payable to city.

B.  The city shall have the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under a franchise agreement; provided, however, that such audit shall commence within thirty-six months following the close of each of the franchisee's fiscal years (unless subsequent information indicates fraud or improper withholding of information, in which case the thirty-six month limitation shall not apply), and that the city shall not conduct such an audit more frequently than twice in one year (unless subsequent information indicates fraud or improper withholding of information). The franchisee shall make such records available to the city within ten days of request. Such records shall be available for inspection by the city upon ten days' request during normal business hours and shall be retained by the franchisee for a period of three years. 
C.  The city will bear the cost of any such audit; provided, however, that if such audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of five percent or more of the amount due, franchisee shall assume all costs of such audit and pay such costs at such time as any proceedings contesting the city's audit are completed. 
D.  Any additional amounts due to the city as a result of the audit shall automatically be paid within thirty days following the completion of the audit. The franchisee shall be given a copy of the audit report. 
E.  The franchisee has the right to appeal the results of any audit conducted by the city; nevertheless, the franchisee shall remain liable and shall pay the city the amount owed according to the audit. Upon final determination of the audit appeal, if the franchisee has overpaid franchise fees, then the city will remit such overpayment within thirty days of completion of the determination of overpayment. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.330 - Acceptance by city. 
No acceptance by the city of any payment from franchisee shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the franchisee. Acceptance of an accord and satisfaction or release shall not occur unless or until the city shall agree to such accord and satisfaction or release in a separate writing, signed by the city. There shall be an accord and satisfaction with respect to any payment not subject to audit within thirty-six months following the close of the fiscal year to which such payment relates, unless there is subsequent evidence that franchisee has engaged in fraud or has improperly withheld relevant records which relate to such payments. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.335 - Late payment of franchise fee to be charged interest and penalty. 
In the event that the franchisee does not make any franchise payment(s) or recomputed amount(s) on or before the applicable date(s) heretofore specified, then a late penalty shall accrue at a rate of one and one-half percent per month on the unpaid amount(s) from the date on which it was due. If the franchisee has not made a franchise payment or recomputed amount on or before the date that such payment or amount is otherwise due in accordance with the provisions of this chapter or the franchisee's franchise agreement and such payment or recomputed amount is not made within five days after receipt of written notice from the city, franchisee shall pay an additional late penalty. Such a late penalty shall be an amount equal to ten percent of the total unpaid amount including accrued interest. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2 1998)  
5.20.340 - Alternative user charge. 
A.  This section is applicable to any licensed but unfranchised cable service provider, and to any cable service provider who has had its franchise ruled unconstitutional, unenforceable or invalid. This section also is applicable to a franchised cable service provider who has had its franchise fees ruled unconstitutional, unenforceable or invalid. 
B.  Where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law, and as an alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth in this chapter, the franchising authority may impose, extract and collect a charge from an affected cable service provider for the use by such provider of the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and right ways of the city. 
C.  Such an alternative user charge shall be based on the value of the rights-of-way being used by the affected cable service provider as determined by the city. However, in no event, shall the alternative user charge exceed five percent of the affected cable service provider's gross revenue for the reporting period. 
D.  An alternative user charge is adopted in order to receive fair compensation for the affected cable service provider's use of the public streets and public ways if such compensation cannot be obtained by imposing a flat percentage fee on such cable service provider's annual gross revenue. However, an affected cable service provider may agree to an alternative charge that is based on a flat percentage of gross revenue, as long as that charge does not exceed five percent of an affected cable service provider's annual gross revenue. 
E.  It is expressly understood that a franchise fee and an alternative user charge will not be imposed on the same cable service provider at the same time, for the same period. 
F.  An affected cable service provider shall at no time be charged or obligated to pay an alternative user charge that exceeds five percent of such provider's gross revenue (as defined by this chapter) for any particular reporting period. In the event that the alternative user charge does exceed five percent of gross revenue, then such alternative user charge shall be reduced to reflect an amount not greater than the five percent cap. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.345 - Alternative user charge to be paid quarterly along with statement verifying gross revenues. 
The alternative user charge assessed shall be payable quarterly to the city. The cable service provider shall file a complete, accurate and certified statement of gross revenues within the city during the period for which such quarterly payment covers, and such payment shall be made to the city not later than thirty days after the end of each quarter.

5.20.350 - Franchise required—Exception. 
A.  No person or cable service provider shall be permitted to construct, operate or maintain a cable system which requires the laying or positioning or use of cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) across the rights-of-way of the city, without having first obtained a cable service franchise, unless such person or cable service provider is exempted under state law, or not required under the Cable Act. 
B.  Consistent with the Cable Act, no franchise shall be required for the city to operate as cable service provider.

The cable administrator shall have primary responsibility for continuing administration of this chapter and all cable service provider franchise agreements. With regard to all questions or disputes concerning the performance of the franchisee under any of the terms or conditions of this agreement, the franchisee agrees to deal either with the cable administrator as common agent for the city subscribers or directly with the affected subscribers, at the option of the cable administrator.

Subject to the provisions of this chapter, construction or reconstruction in accordance with the plan submitted by a franchisee shall occur according to the time schedule set forth in the franchisee's franchise agreement and shall commence as soon after the effective date of the franchise as is reasonably possible. Failure to complete such construction or reconstruction shall be grounds for termination of the franchise and/or liquidated damages for each day, or part thereof, that such construction or reconstruction remains uncompleted due to any cause or event within the franchisee's control in addition to such other remedies as may be applicable under the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.460 - Service drops. 
A.  Franchisee shall make service available to any subscriber within the city upon subscriber's request and at the standard connection charge if the connection requires no more than a one-hundred-foot aerial or one-hundred-foot underground drop, measured from the demarcation point of subscriber's residence or place of business to franchisee's nearest activated coaxial distribution line, and includes one standard video outlet and standard materials. 
B.  If making service available requires more than a standard drop (such as a wall fish installation), franchisee may charge the subscriber (1) the standard connection charge; and (2) an amount equal to the reasonable actual labor (including wages, benefits and payroll taxes), material and other costs incurred by franchisee for the additional facilities and work (including a reasonable allowance for overhead). In the alternative, franchisee may charge an appropriate hourly service charge for the entire installation. 
C.  Standard drops shall be accomplished, no less than ninety-five percent of the time measured on a quarterly basis, within seven calendar days of subscriber's requested installation date and payment under normal operating conditions; a nonstandard drop shall be accomplished within thirty calendar days of a subscriber's request and payment. The ability of franchisee to extend a drop within such time periods is predicated upon the assumptions that a franchisee is able to secure all necessary rights-of-way at the location of the drop upon reasonable terms and conditions, that the schedule or preferences of the person requesting the installation have not been responsible for delay, and that all applicable fees and charges have been timely paid and collected. Should franchisee or the city receive a complaint from any resident of the city that cable service was not installed for that resident within the time periods stated above, franchisee shall complete such installation within two business days after notice to franchisee of such complaint, subject to the provisions of this section, and that resident shall be charged no installation fee for such installation.

1.  The franchisee's standard connection fee, if any, plus the actual installation costs incurred by the franchisee for the distance exceeding the standards set forth in the preceding subsection or 
2.  The franchisee's hourly service charge for the entire installation, as the case may be. 
B.  Actual installation costs include reasonable actual labor or hourly service charges (including wages, benefits and payroll taxes) and material costs incurred by franchisee for the additional work beyond, as applicable, one hundred fifty feet or one hundred feet, together with a reasonable charge for overhead. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.470 - Underground installation not to exceed standard installation if subscriber provides trenching and conduit. 
In the event that a subscriber independently provides for his or her own trenching and conduit (including any necessary boring, backfilling, replacing and/or replanting), which trenching and conduit must comply with the city's and franchisee's construction standards, the installation charge shall be the same as for a standard installation, if such an installation is standardized, or at reasonable rate and charges, provided, however, that the subscriber agrees in writing and in a form acceptable to the franchisee and the city to hold the franchisee and the city harmless for any injury, loss or damage caused by or related to the work so undertaken by the subscriber, and that the franchisee shall not be responsible for any service problems caused as a result of the work performed by the subscriber. In such case the installation by the franchisee will consist of a standard service drop. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)  
5.20.475 - Installation of A/B switches. 
Franchisee shall offer new subscribers the option of having an A/B switch installed by franchisee at the time of installation of new cable service, and shall install A/B switches at the request of any subscriber who currently receives cable service for a reasonable fee.

In addition, the city may at any time conduct independent inspections or measurements of the system (e.g., measurements at subscriber terminals). 
B.  Where the city has reasonable evidence to conclude that franchisee's system is not in technical compliance with all applicable standards, the city may require franchisee to allow the city to conduct the city's own technical testing of the cable system. If franchisee's cable system is not in technical compliance with applicable standards, a franchisee shall pay the costs incurred by the city for any technical assistance deemed necessary by the city for (1) observing franchisee's annual performance tests, or (2) obtaining independent verification of technical compliance with all standards.

B.  The city may at some future time decide to underground into conduit all aerial utilities and services in the city. The city grants franchisees permission to locate cable systems above ground until such undergrounding transpires; provided, however, that if and when above ground utilities and services are relocated underground, the franchisee agrees to relocate its cable system underground. In consideration for the franchisee being allowed to install the franchisee's cable system above ground, the franchisee agrees to relocate its cable services underground, contemporaneously with the undergrounding of all other utilities and services at no cost to the city. The franchisee agrees to bear all costs incurred in such underground relocation, removal or other work in consideration for being allowed to construct such cable system above ground using existing aerial supports.

At the option of the city, such trimming may be done by the city at the expense of the franchisee, or by the franchisee under the city's supervision and direction at the expense of the franchisee. When trees, tree branches or roots are located near the wires and cable of both franchisee and other utilities, then the costs of trimming such trees, tree branches or roots are to be allocated pro rata among the franchisee and such other utilities. When authorized, such trimming shall be limited to the area required for clear wiring passage and shall not include major structural branches which materially alter the appearance and natural growth habits of the tree. If such trimming is not performed by the city, the franchisee shall be responsible for any and all damages to any tree as a result of trimming or to the land surrounding any tree whether such tree is trimmed or removed, or for damage to property or person caused by such trimming and removal of any tree to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of the franchisee, its employees or contractors.

3.  A part of the system which is visible or accessible to the public or is capable of causing a safety hazard, is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of ninety days, or the city has terminated, canceled, revoked or affirmatively denied renewal of the franchise, a franchisee shall promptly at its own expense and upon written notice remove from the city all such property and poles of such cable system other than any which the city permits to be abandoned in place. 
B.  In the event of such removal, a franchisee shall at its own expense promptly replace or repair and restore the street or other area from which such property has been removed to its prior condition, or better, as is reasonably possible consistent with applicable ordinances, codes and regulations of the city as determined by the city. The franchisee may be permitted to abandon in place the underground portion of its cable system, provided that no portion of such cable system is accessible to the public or is capable of causing a safety hazard subject to the right of the city to require that the franchisee remove such underground portion of the cable system which interferes with roadwork or other road construction. In the event that any part of such cable system or property has been installed in any street or public place without complying with the requirements of this chapter or the franchise agreement, then the city may require the franchisee either to remedy such noncompliance, or if the franchisee should fail to remedy such noncompliance within thirty days of receipt of notice by the city, to remove such part of the cable system as provided in this section.

Upon abandonment in place of the property of a franchisee, the franchisee shall submit to the city an instrument in writing, to be approved by the city transferring to the city the ownership of such property. If such an instrument is not received within thirty days of the city granting permission to abandon in place the property, the property shall automatically become that of the city. 
C.  Any abandonment, either with or without the city's consent, shall not relieve the franchisee from its obligations to remove and/or remediate all toxic or hazardous materials (as defined by applicable provisions of either state or federal law), nor shall such abandonment relieve the franchisee from its defense and indemnification obligations regarding the same. 
(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)

B.  Such portions of the plant which are subject to removal or wreck-out in accordance with the provisions of this section must be removed before any construction, reconstruction, or rebuild is deemed complete by the city. Franchisee shall not be in default of any completion deadline unless franchisee has been given notice and opportunity to cure such default as provided in Section 5.20.255(A). However, franchisee will not be required to remove or wreck-out, and may be permitted to abandon in place, any underground plant which has been rebuilt or replaced, provided that no portion of the abandoned plant is accessible to the public or is capable of causing a safety hazard. 
C.

Nothing in this chapter or the franchise agreement shall hinder the right of the city or any governmental authority to perform or carry on, directly or indirectly, any public works or public improvements of any description. Should the cable system in any instance interfere with the construction, maintenance, or repair of such public works or public improvements, the franchisee shall, upon reasonable notice and at its own cost and expense, protect or relocate its cable system, or part thereof, as reasonably directed by the city. Unless an emergency situation exists, for the purpose of this section and in order to allow the franchisee to budget for any required relocation, in the event that public works or public improvement projects are pre-planned in the city's prior year budget process, "reasonable notice" will be construed as written notification of no later than October 31st of the prior year, or within forty-five days of the conclusion of the city's budget process, whichever allows the city more time. The franchisee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of its property. If public funds are available to any company using such street, easement, or right-of-way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, such funds shall also be made available to the franchisee.

(Ord. 98-287 § 2, 1998)

The answering service or automated response unit shall be able to contact and dispatch a repair technician to meet the requirements of this section for a system service interruption. For nonemergency problems (e.g., requests for adding premium services), a franchisee's customer service representative is to return the phone call to the customer the next business day after the customer's call to the answering service or automated response unit. In addition, franchisee shall develop or cause to be developed a log which, at a minimum, contains and segregates the number and nature of calls made to its answering service or automated response unit from subscribers within the city on an ongoing basis, and the franchisee shall report this information, when requested by the cable administrator.

5.20.1025 - Telephone access to customer service supervisors. 
If a subscriber states that he or she is unsatisfied with the response of a customer service representative, or asks to speak with a customer service supervisor or any qualified supervisor, the matter shall be immediately referred to a qualified supervisor for resolution. If no customer service supervisor or other qualified supervisor is available, the customer service representative must record the pertinent information and a qualified supervisor shall return the telephone call as promptly as possible, but in no event later than one business day. If that call does not achieve contact with the subscriber, the supervisor must utilize reasonable efforts to do so including, without limitation, calling periodically, leaving a telephone message or writing the subscriber to give a direct dial or extension number to reach the supervisor directly. If a subscriber remains dissatisfied with the resolution of his or her complaint following review by a qualified supervisor, the subscriber shall be referred to the manager or director of customer service for final resolution. The manager or director of customer service shall provide the customer with a follow up written response detailing the corrective measures taken by the franchisee within seven days of the customer's initial call or complaint, a copy of which shall be sent to the cable administrator.

Trained customer service representatives shall be available to respond to customer telephone inquiries during normal business hours, defined as not less than nine hours per business day Monday through Friday and four hours on Saturday. 
B.  Franchisee shall connect a telephone caller within thirty seconds after the caller dials and "ringing" begins. This standard shall be deemed satisfied when a connection is made either to an automated attendant capable of responding to the subscriber's inquiry, such as an automatic response unit, or to a customer service representative capable of responding to the subscriber's inquiry. Under normal operating conditions, the caller will receive a busy signal less than three percent of the time. 
C.  If the call needs to be transferred, if the caller needs to be placed on hold, or if the caller wishes to be transferred, such transfer or hold time shall not exceed thirty seconds. 
D.  Each of the standards set forth in this section shall be met no less than ninety-five percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis, under normal operating conditions. The franchisee maintains the burden of providing a statistical printout so that compliance can be determined. However, the franchisee will not be required to acquire equipment to measure compliance with the telephone answering standards above unless a historical record of complaints indicates a clear failure to comply. 
E.  During the hours when a customer service representative of franchisee is not on duty to receive calls, a qualified employee or contractor shall either be available to an adequately trained answering service or to an automated paging system to act upon subscriber calls to correct service interruptions in cable service as provided in this article.

5.20.1040 - Failure to satisfy telephone system requirements. 
A.  If the cable administrator reviews the telephone usage complaints against a franchisee and finds them to reflect a failure to comply with the standards of this chapter, the cable administrator shall direct the franchisee to provide to the city, at the franchisee's cost, a statistically accurate call traffic study which shall identify the franchisee's compliance with the requirements of this chapter and propose remedies to correct any deficiencies in compliance. This study shall be delivered to the city within ninety days following receipt of written notice from the city specifying the need for such study. The study shall be conducted over a period of ninety days so as to determine whether the standards set forth in this section have been satisfied no less than ninety-five percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis, under normal operating condition. 
B.  Remedy. In the event that the city determines that the franchisee has failed to meet the standards set out in this section based upon such study, the franchisee shall have thirty days from written notification of such noncompliance by the city to cure the same. Failure to meet the requirements of this section will result in foreseeable damages in an amount specified in Article VIII, "Liquidated Damages."

B.  If a work interruption is reasonably necessary (for example, to obtain unforeseeable but necessary permits, tools, materials, equipment or additional personnel), the employee or contractor shall complete such work at the earliest reasonable date that is convenient to the customer, provided; however, that a lack of an adequate supply of cable converters or other electronic hardware shall not be deemed a necessary work interruption. 
C.

D.  If such repair is not possible, the employee or contractor shall leave a door hanger at the customer's location which shall notify the customer that a repair was attempted and ask the customer to call the franchisee to reschedule another mutually convenient service call.

The credit shall automatically appear in the customer's next billing cycle.

Consistent with Section 5.20.620, franchisee shall furnish and maintain services to each person within the franchise area who makes a bona fide request to receive any service.

Subscribers not satisfied that their cable services have been provided as required in the franchise agreement or this chapter shall be encouraged to notify the franchisee, and the franchisee shall notify subscribers of the opportunity to do so in franchisee's annual notice required to be distributed to subscribers. A franchisee shall work with the subscriber to resolve the problem. Upon request and verification, franchisee shall provide a credit to service charges for each service interruption as set forth in this section. 
B.  Any signal interruption or service interruption of a combined duration of fifteen minutes or more in any continuous twenty-four hours (when normal operating conditions exist), whatever its cause, shall entitle each subscriber or subscribers affected to an automatic credit of the monthly subscribe fee pro rated on a per day basis. Such credit must be applied to the first bill issued following the interruption. The only exceptions are for interruptions due to power outages which exceed the operating limits of the system's backup power supplies, acts of God or nature, or scheduled outages. 
C.  Any signal interruption or service interruption shall be computed from the time the franchisee receives notice from the first subscriber. In no event shall a franchisee be required to credit a subscriber's account in an amount in excess of one day's credit for each day a customer endures a service interruption. For example, a customer suffers a service interruption for five hours; this would entitle the customer to one day of credit. If there was a loss of signal during two four-hour periods within the same day, the customer would still be entitled to only one day's credit. If, however, a service interruption runs into a second or more days, then one day's credit is due for each day, or part thereof, the service interruption occurs. Failure to meet the requirements of this section will result in foreseeable damages in an amount specified in Article VIII, "Liquidated Damages." 
D.  No credit shall be required for any service interruption which is caused by the acts or omissions of the subscriber, video, audio or other equipment of the subscriber. 
E.  The franchisee's customer service manager shall be given authority to credit a subscriber's account for a service interruption or signal interruption of in an amount up to one month's service charges, based upon the facts and circumstances of the complaint.

5.20.1180 - Subscriber's liability for loss or damage to converter or other electronic equipment is limited if it can be shown franchisee contributed to such loss. 
Notwithstanding any other sections of this chapter, where the actions of a franchisee, its agent(s) or subcontractor(s) can be shown, upon a reasonable demonstration of evidence by a subscriber or the cable administrator, to have been the substantial cause for the theft, loss or damage of a converter or other electronic equipment provided for the use of a subscriber (for example, by leaving a converter or other electronic equipment unattended on a subscriber's doorstep when delivering such converter to the subscriber), the subscriber shall have no liability with respect to such theft, loss or damage. Where the franchisee fails to retrieve a converter or other electronic equipment within seven days after a disconnection and the local office located in the city is not staffed or operated in accordance with this chapter or the franchise agreement, neither the city nor the subscriber shall have liability with respect to such converter or other electronic equipment nor shall a franchisee subject a subscriber to any charges in connection with the failure by the franchisee to regain such converter or other electronic equipment.

2.  To pay for more than thirty days of such services at any one time, provided, however, that the subscriber may be required to pay for more than thirty days of service if the account is or has been past due. The franchisee shall clearly disclose on the billing statement both the date on which the payment is due and the date on which a penalty may begin to accrue if payment has not been received. There shall be a minimum of fifteen days from the date of the postmark on billing statements to the payment due date, and there shall be a minimum of forty-five days from the date of the postmark on the first billing statement to the imposition of a late fee.

C.  Advising subscribers, whenever applicable, that known or planned service outages may affect subscribers' cable reception, provided, however, that in lieu of this franchisee may use a character generator to disclose such information on an appropriate and convenient channel.

ARTICLE XXIX. - TERMINATION PROCEDURES 
 
5.20.1275 - Requirement of notice and opportunity to cure—Reason for suspension of requirement. 
A.  The cable administrator shall provide notice and opportunity to cure for each occurrence, event, incident, violation, failure, refusal, neglect or breach of this chapter, the franchise agreement, local, state, or federal law or regulation which the cable administrator deems sufficient to warrant termination of the franchise agreement. 
B.  Notice and the opportunity to cure shall be in writing, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the franchisee's local place of business or any other place reasonably calculated to provide such notice to the franchisee.

C.  The cable administrator shall make a written notice to cure and demand that a franchisee comply with any provision, rule, order, or determination under or pursuant to the cable service provider ordinance or the franchise agreement. If the occurrence, event, incident, violation, failure, refusal, neglect or breach by a franchisee continues for a period beyond the stated opportunity to cure period following such written demand without written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the cable administrator may place the issue of termination of a franchise before the council. The cable administrator shall cause to be served upon franchisee, at least thirty days prior to the day of such council meeting, a written notice of intent to request termination and the time and place of the meeting. Such notice shall specify the failure alleged to have occurred.

The franchisee may, at its own expense, make a transcript of any such hearing or share equally with the city the costs of obtaining a transcript of such hearing. 
B.  At the completion of the hearing or a reasonable time thereafter, the council shall issue a written determination as to whether such an occurrence, event, incident, violation, failure, refusal, neglect or breach has occurred based upon the record of such proceeding, stating with particularity the reasons for such determination. A copy of the council's determination shall be provided to the franchisee. 
C.  In the event that the council finds that: 
1.  No failure occurred, 
2.  The franchisee remedied the failure or (3) the franchisee promptly commenced to remedy such failure following receipt of written notice from the cable administrator and actively and expeditiously proceeded, or is actively and expeditiously proceeding, to complete such remedy, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanctions shall be imposed.

If the council determines that the occurrence, event, incident, violation, failure, refusal, neglect or breach by a franchisee of a term or condition of this chapter, the franchise agreement, or other law or regulation was the fault of the franchisee and within its control, following the notice and opportunity to cure and due process requirements of this, the council may declare the franchise terminated.

C.  If the city questions the accuracy of the information provided under subsection (B) of this section, it must notify the cable operator within thirty days of the filing of such information, or such information shall be deemed accepted, unless the cable service provider has failed to provide any additional information reasonably requested by the franchise authority within ten days of such request. 
D.  If the city fails to act upon such transfer request within one hundred twenty days, such request shall be deemed granted unless the franchise authority and the requesting party otherwise agree to an extension of time.

A franchisee shall submit to the city an original petition, which includes the completed FCC Form 394, and four copies, unless otherwise directed, which petition shall fully describe the terms and conditions of the action or proposed action subject to this section and clearly state the basis on which the petition should be approved.

ARTICLE XXXII. - REGULATION OF STATE VIDEO AND CABLE SERVICE FRANCHISE HOLDERS 
 
5.20.1405 - Applicability of chapter to state video services franchisees. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require any person or entity to obtain a franchise issued by the city, to the extent that such person or entity is authorized to provide cable service or video services under a cable franchise or video services franchise issued by another government entity under applicable law, including but not limited to Section 5800 et seq. of the California Public Utilities Code. The requirements and provisions of this chapter shall not apply or be enforced to the extent that they actually conflict with applicable state or federal law. 
(Ord. 2008-378 § 1(part), 2008)  
5.20.1410 - Regulation of state video services franchisees. 
Sections 5.20.1405 through 5.20.1440 of this chapter are intended to regulate video service providers holding state video franchises and operating within the city. Since January 1, 2007, the state of California has had the sole authority to grant state video franchises pursuant to the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 ("Act"). Pursuant to the Act, the city of Big Bear Lake shall receive a franchise fee and may receive a fee for public, educational and government ("PEG") purposes from all state video franchise holders operating within the city. Additionally, the city has the responsibility to establish and enforce penalties, consistent with state law, against all state video franchise holders operating within the city for violations of customer service standards, but the Act grants all authority to adopt customer service standards to the state. The Act leaves unchanged the city's authority to regulate the city's current cable franchise in accordance with this chapter and the cable franchise currently in effect, until such time as the cable franchisee no longer holds a city franchise or is no longer operating under a current or expired city franchise.

B.  Any state video franchise holder operating within the boundaries of the city of Big Bear Lake shall pay to the city, in addition to the franchise fee, a fee equal to one percent of the gross revenue of that state video franchise holder, which shall be used by the city for public, educational, and government access purposes consistent with state and federal law. This fee obligation shall take effect upon the earlier of: (1) the fulfillment of all obligations to remit cash payments to the city for support of public, educational, and government access facilities which are contained within a city-issued cable franchise that was in effect on January 1, 2007, and which remained unsatisfied as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article; or (2) the termination by the holder of a city-issued cable franchise of its franchise as provided under state law. The intent of this subsection is to comply with the requirements of subsections (l), (m), and (n) of Section 5870 of the California Public Utilities Code, and the fee established in this subsection is intended to be a fee authorized by subsection (n) of Section 5870. 
C.  Gross revenue, for the purposes of subsections A and B above, shall have the definition set forth in California Public Utilities Code 5860. 
D.  To the extent reauthorization is required by law, this Article XXXII, including the PEG fee specified in subsection B of this Section 5.20.1415, is automatically reauthorized as to each affected state video franchise holder upon the expiration of any state video franchise. Any and all reauthorizations shall be effective for so long as such reauthorization is required by law.

5.20.1425 - Customer service penalties under state video franchises. 
A.  Any holder of a state video franchise operating within the boundaries of the city of Big Bear Lake shall comply with all applicable state and federal customer service and protection standards pertaining to the provision of video service. The city manager, or his or her designee, shall provide any required notice in advance of enforcing such standards, including but not limited to the ninety (90) day notice required by 47 CFR 76.309(a), 76.1602(a), 76.1603(a), and 76.1619(c). 
B.

Chapter 5.98 - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 
Sections: 
 
5.98.010 - Purpose.

The city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of sexually oriented businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this chapter to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to ameliorate the harmful effects of sexually oriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of sexually oriented businesses in certain areas.

Conditions of approval may be required of the person or entity applying for the exemption. Such conditions must be maintained throughout the life of the exemption. The failure to maintain such conditions may lead to the revocation of the previously approved exemption.

The county auditor shall cause the amount of the same to be entered upon the property from which removal was accomplished, and the said special assessment and tax shall be included upon the next succeeding tax statement. Thereafter, the amounts of the assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes are collected, and are subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary county taxes, except that if any real property to which such lien would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of such taxes would become delinquent, then the lien which would otherwise be imposed by this section shall not attach to such real property and the costs of abatement, as confirmed, relating to such property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. If the property is tax-exempt, collection may be made by any appropriate means. 
B.  Appeals. Any appeal from these charges must be filed within sixty days from the date of billing or date of mailing of a tax bill which shows abatement charges, if and only if, no bill was received by the appellant. The appeal procedure shall be essentially the same as Section 8.72.050 of this chapter, and the appeal board's decision shall be conclusive. 
C.  Cancellation of Lien. All or any portion of any such special assessment, penalty or costs heretofore entered, shall on order of the board of appeals be canceled by the auditor if uncollected, or, except in the case provided for in subsection (C)(5) of this section, refunded by the county treasurer if collected, if it or they were entered, charged or paid. 
1.  More than once; 
2.  Through clerical error; 
3.  Through the error or mistake of the board of appeals or of the officer, board or commission designated by them to give notice to destroy the weeds, in respect to any material fact, including the case where the cost report rendered and confirmed as hereinbefore provided shows the city abated the weeds but such is not the actual fact; 
4.  Illegally; 
5.  On property acquired after the lien date by the state or by any county, city, school district or other political subdivision and because of this public ownership, not subject to sale for delinquent taxes. 
D.  Procedure for Refund of Payment. No order for a refund under subsection C of this section shall be made except on a claim: 
1.  Verified by the person who paid the special assessment, his guardian, executor or administrator; 
2.  Filed within three years after making the payment sought to be refunded.

E.  Payment of any fine or service of a jail sentence shall not relieve a person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity from the responsibility of correcting the condition resulting from the violation. 
F.  In addition to the above penalties, the court may order that the guilty party reimburse the city for all of its costs of investigating, analyzing and prosecuting the enforcement action against the guilty party.

(Ord. 90-186 § 1(part), 1990)  
8.82.080 - Emergency abatement and other services. 
A.  Emergency Abatement.

Required notification procedures prior to disposal of such vehicle(s) shall be followed. 
B.  Request for Service. If any member of the public, except self-storage operators, requests CDD in writing to remove abandoned, dismantled, inoperative, junked or wrecked vehicles or parts thereof, CDD is authorized to provide processing and removal for a fee which covers all CDD costs. The removed abandoned, dismantled, inoperative, junked or wrecked vehicles or parts thereof, through transfer of title or lien sale process shall become the property of the city and such will be the responsibility of the city to dispose of according to law. 
C.  Complaints. CDD will investigate anonymous complaints associated with abandoned, dismantled, inoperative, junked or wrecked vehicles or parts thereof. The complaint may be phoned in or be in writing and must have situs address and/or assessor parcel number with a description of the violation.

8.82.090 - Abatement procedures for vehicles which are a public nuisance. 
A ten-day notice of intent to abate and remove shall be given to the property owner to remove the vehicle or vehicles or parts thereof, as a public nuisance, unless the property owner and the owner of the vehicle have signed releases authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof. Notification shall be given either by personal delivery or posting the property, and shall be mailed by registered or certified mail addressed to the property owner at the his/her last known business or residence address as the same appears in the public records of the last equalized assessment roll, and to the last registered and/or legal owner of the vehicle by registered or certified mail to the last address listed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. If such a vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership, notice need not be given to the last registered and/or legal owner. The notice shall be substantially as follows: 
You are hereby notified to abate this public nuisance by removal of the vehicle(s) or parts thereof within ten days from the date of mailing of this notice. If you fail to do so, the public nuisance and such dismantled, wrecked, junked, inoperative, abandoned vehicles or parts thereof, will be abated and removed by San Bernardino County DEHS and/or contract services and all the costs for abatement and removal, together with administrative costs, may be assessed to the legal owner of the land on which the public nuisance and such dismantled, junked, abandoned, inoperative vehicle or parts thereof are located. 
The notice shall also set forth the procedures and time period for filing an appeal. The notice shall contain a statement of the hearing rights of the owner of the property on which the vehicle is located and of the owner of the vehicle. The statement shall include notice to the property owner that he/she may appear in person at a hearing or may submit a sworn statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his/her reasons for such denial, in lieu of appearing. 
If the nuisance is not abated and a request for hearing has not been received within the time period given in the notice, the CDD is authorized to abate the nuisance. 
A notice of intent to abate and remove shall not be required for removal of a vehicle or parts thereof which is inoperable due to the absence of a motor, transmission, or wheels and incapable of being towed; is valued at less than two hundred dollars; and is determined to be a public nuisance presenting an immediate threat to public health or safety; provided that the property owner has signed a release authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or parts thereof. Notice of intent to dispose of the vehicle or parts thereof shall be provided to the last registered and legal owners prior to the final disposition. If the vehicle or parts thereof are not claimed and removed within twelve days after the notice is mailed, the CDD may authorize disposal of the vehicle and parts thereof. This paragraph shall only apply to inoperable vehicles located upon a parcel that is either zoned for agricultural use or is not improved with a residential structure containing one or more dwelling units. 
Notice shall be given to the Department of Motor Vehicles within five days after the date of removal of vehicles under this section, identifying the vehicle or part thereof and any evidence of registration available, including, but not limited to, the registration card, certificates of ownership, or license plates. 
No vehicle which has been abated or removed as a public nuisance shall thereafter be reconstructed or made operable unless it is a vehicle which qualifies for either horseless carriage license plates or historical vehicle license plates. 
The city and/or contract services shall not liable for damage caused to a vehicle or part thereof by removal pursuant to this section. 
(Ord. 90-186 § 1(part), 1990)  
8.82.100 - Payment for abatement of vehicles which are a public nuisance. 
When abatement has been completed, the director of CDD shall render to the city finance director an itemized statement covering work necessary for the abatement. The city finance director shall pay the same from the funds of the agency causing the work to be done, and the director shall present to the property owner a demand for payment by mail. If payment is not made on behalf of the property owner within sixty days after mailing of such bill, the director shall file a notice of pendency and certify to the finance director the remaining unpaid cost. The finance director shall cause the amount of the same to be entered upon the next succeeding secured tax roll. Thereafter, the amounts of the assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes are collected, and are subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary county taxes, except that if any real property to which such lien would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien or a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attached thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of such taxes would become delinquent, then the lien which would otherwise be imposed by this section shall not attach to such real property and the costs of abatement, as confirmed, relating to such property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection from the person who was the property owner at the time of the abatement. 
(Ord. 90-186 § 1(part), 1990)  
8.82.110 - Appeals of abatement. 
Upon written request by the legal owner of the vehicle under title or requiring registration under the California Vehicle Code, received by the CDD within ten days after mailing of the notice of intent to abate and remove, or a sworn written statement from the owner of the land, claiming nonresponsibility for the vehicle(s), a public hearing shall be held by the administrative board on the abatement and removal of such vehicle(s) and parts thereof as a public nuisance. The sworn written statement shall be construed as a request for hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting such request. The administrative board shall hear and act on appeals within sixty days of filing and its determination shall be conclusive. The owner of the land on which the vehicle is located may appear in person at the hearing, or present a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his/her reasons for such denial. If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the landowner and that he/she has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, then the local authority shall not assess the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such cost from such owner. The administrative appeals board shall consist of the city attorney as chair, the commander of the local sheriff's station and one public member appointed by the city council. The board shall operate under the rules established for judicial arbitration established by the California Code of Civil Procedures. 
(Ord. 90-186 § 1(part), 1990)  
8.82.120 - Appeals of charges.

A.  More than once; 
B.  Through clerical error; 
C.  Through the error or mistake of the administrative board, the director, or the person designated by them to give notice to abate regarding any material fact relevant to the determination of a charge; 
D.  Illegally; 
E.  The owner of the land was not responsible for the vehicle(s); 
F.  On property acquired after the lien date by the state or by any county, city, school district, or other political subdivision and because of this public ownership, not subject to sale for delinquent taxes 
(Ord. 90-186 § 1(part), 1990)  
8.82.140 - Procedure for refund of payment.

A.  Verified by the person who paid the special assessment, their guardian, executor, or administrator; 
B.  Filed within three years after making the payment sought to be refunded. 
(Ord. 90-186 § 1(part), 1990)  
8.82.150 - Payment for abatement of abandoned vehicles. 
The abandonment of any vehicle on public or private property shall constitute a prima facie presumption that the last registered owner of record is responsible for the abandonment and thereby liable for the cost of removal and disposition of the vehicle. When the abatement has been completed, the director of CDD shall render to the city finance director an itemized statement covering work necessary for abatement. The finance director shall pay the same from the funds of the agency causing the work to be done, and the director shall present to the registered owner of the vehicle a demand for payment of the costs required for removal and disposition of the vehicle, not to exceed those for towing and seven days of storage.

B.  It is the intent of the council in passing and enacting this chapter to minimize the number of false alarms and the negative effects associated therewith, while at the same time permitting law enforcement officials to use their resources most effectively and efficiently to provide victims or crimes perpetrated against their property, dwellings and other structures.

(Ord. 2008-379 § 2 (part), 2008)  
8.94.090 - Protection of sensitive biological resources. 
A.  Should any owner receive a NOTICE TO ABATE form that mandates the modification of Native Brush or shrubs other than the following shrub species: Juniper, Spanish broom or Native Brush species: manzanita, service berry, mountain whitethorn, sage, or mountain mahogany and the property falls within the potential sensitive shrub resource area (as set forth in the city's official records, and which may be amended from time to time), a sensitive plant survey will be required for the property prior to any abatement activities. If it unclear whether a particular property falls within the potential sensitive shrub resource area or whether or not sensitive plant surveys are required, the owner must contact the city of Big Bear Lake, planning department. The city's planning department shall provide requesting owners with a list of qualified surveyors, which list may be updated or revised at the discretion of the city. Ideally, sensitive plant surveys should be conducted between June and August to encompass the blooming periods of those sensitive plants that are the most difficult to detect outside the blooming period; however, the sensitive plant survey can be conducted during other parts of the year (aside from periods when snowfall is covering the ground) if necessary. Upon completion of the survey, the surveyor shall advise the owner as to any known or potential sensitive plants that should be avoided during abatement activities. A form shall be completed at the end of the survey that will provide details as to the results of the survey. The surveyor shall provide a copy of the form to the owner and the planning and fire departments. The owner shall not conduct any modification without prior written approval of the city. All surveys required by this subsection shall be conducted within a reasonable time, as determined by the fire chief, or his or her designee. 
B.  If any Native Brush modification is required for more than twenty (20) shrubs and vegetation modification activities cannot be performed outside the nesting season (typical nesting season is March 15 through August 15), a nesting bird survey shall be performed less than one week prior to vegetation modification activities. Should the owner be required to conduct a nesting bird survey, he or she shall contact the city of Big Bear Lake planning department for a list of qualified nesting bird surveyors, which list may be updated or revised at the discretion of the city. Upon completion of the survey, the surveyor shall advise the owner as to any shrub(s) containing nesting birds that should not be modified until the completion of the nesting cycle. A form shall be completed at the end of the survey that will provide details as to the results of the survey. The surveyor shall provide a copy of the form to the owner and the planning and fire departments. The owner shall not conduct any modification without prior written approval of the city. All surveys required by this subsection shall be conducted within a reasonable time, as determined by the fire chief, or his or her designee. 
C.  Any owner receiving a NOTICE TO ABATE form (for any number of shrubs) will also receive a pamphlet pertaining to providing protection for nesting birds. The pamphlet will describe the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and suggest that if vegetation modification will occur during the nesting season (March 15 through August 15), owners need to check for the presence of active bird nests and avoid modification of any vegetation containing an active bird nest (or vegetation within twenty-five (25) feet of the active bird nest) until the young have fledged. 
(Ord. 2008-379 § 2 (part), 2008)

B.  The fire protection district board shall conduct the hearing under such rules of procedure as are appropriate to quasi-judicial proceedings, provided that the appellant and the parties shall be entitled to present relevant evidence, testify under oath, and call witnesses who shall testify under oath and that the parties shall not be bound by the statutory rules of evidence in the hearing, except that hearsay evidence may not be the sole basis for the determination of the fire protection district board. The city shall have the initial burden of proof. In its discretion, the city shall cause a transcript of the hearing to be taken and prepared. 
C.  In making its determination, the fire protection district board shall consider the evidence presented by the appellant, as well as evidence presented by the fire chief, or his or her designee. The fire protection district board shall also consider the following factors, without limitation, in making its decision regarding the appeal: 
1.  The effect that the fire chief's decision will have on the overall public health, safety and welfare of the city of Big Bear Lake and the community; 
2.  The immediate danger and/or threat to the public if the fire chief's decision is not upheld; 
3.  The financial hardship to the owner should he or she be required to modify the brush and/or shrubs pursuant to this chapter;

Chapter 9.37 - SOCIAL HOSTS AND CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES BY MINORS 
 
9.37.010 - Legislative findings and purpose. 
The city council makes the following findings concerning minors' consumption of alcoholic beverages: 
A.  Minors often obtain, possess or consume alcoholic beverages at gatherings held on private property under the control of a person who knows or should know of the conduct but fails to stop it. 
B.  Underage consumption of alcoholic beverages poses an immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare in that it increases alcohol abuse by minors, physical altercations, violent crimes including rape and other sexual offenses, accidental injury, neighborhood vandalism and excessive noise disturbance, all of which may require intervention by local law enforcement and other emergency response personnel. 
C.  Law enforcement and other emergency personnel responses to disturbances involving underage consumption of alcoholic beverages at gatherings frequently require the use of extensive resources. Further, when these personnel respond to such disturbances, it limits their ability to respond to other service calls in the community, thereby placing the community at increased risk. Law enforcement and other emergency personnel are not currently reimbursed for their expenses when called to multiple disturbances involving underage consumption of alcoholic beverages at gatherings. 
D.  The prohibitions found in this chapter are reasonable and expected to deter consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors by holding persons responsible who encourage, and are aware of or should be aware of, the illegal consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors, but fail to take reasonable steps to prevent it.

Chapter 9.38 - SYNTHETIC DRUGS 
 
9.38.010 - Purpose and intent. 
Recreational use of psychoactive bath salts, psychoactive herbal incense, and similar products, commonly known as "synthetic drugs," has been documented to cause hallucinations, agitation, psychotic episodes, long-term psychosis, seizures, paralysis, kidney failure, increased heart rate and heart attacks, brain swelling and death. While state and federal laws and regulations prohibit some synthetic drugs, the makers of these drugs continually alter the composition of the compounds in their products so as to escape the purview of these laws and regulations. The purpose of these regulations is to provide the city with the means to address the dangers to the community caused by the distribution and sale of synthetic drugs that are not regulated by state or federal law. This chapter is enacted to make synthetic drugs unavailable for distribution and sale within the city. These regulations work in concert with the county regulations to make synthetic drugs unavailable for purchase throughout the entire Big Bear Valley. The intended outcomes of making synthetic drugs unavailable are to promote awareness of the significant dangers of synthetic drugs, to protect people, especially the youth and young adults who may be unaware of the dangers of synthetic drugs, to protect private and public property from damage by users of these drugs, and to maintain the public health, safety and welfare of all citizens and visitors. This chapter shall not apply to any activity already regulated by the State Synthetic Drug Laws, the Federal Controlled Substances Act, or any other applicable state or federal law or regulation. 
(Ord. No. 2016-447, § 4, 1-25-2016)

9.38.030 - Provision, sale, and/or distribution of synthetic drugs prohibited. 
A.  It is unlawful for any person to provide, distribute, or sell any synthetic drug. 
B.  Merely disclaiming a synthetic drug as "not safe for human consumption" will not avoid the application of this chapter.

5.  The product resembles an illicit street drug (such as cocaine, methamphetamine, or marijuana); or 
6.  The product's name or packaging uses images or slang referencing an illicit street drug (such as "Eight Ballz" or "Green Buddha"). 
C.  Merely disclaiming a substance claimed or represented to be a synthetic drug as "not safe for human consumption" will not avoid the application of this chapter.

9.38.050 - Possession of synthetic drugs prohibited. 
It is unlawful for any person to possess any synthetic drug for the purpose of providing, distributing, or selling the synthetic drug.

9.38.080 - Summary abatement. 
Because the use of synthetic drugs has been documented to cause hallucinations, agitation, psychotic episodes, long-term psychosis, seizures, paralysis, kidney failure, increased heart rate and heart attacks, brain swelling and death, any violation of this chapter presents a grave and imminent danger not only to the person consuming the synthetic drug, but also to the public at large.

Chapter 12.60 - NEWSRACKS ON PUBLIC PROPERTY[1] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2009-386, §§ 1, 2, adopted March 23, 2009, repealed and reenacted Chapter 12.60 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, Chapter 12.60, §§ 12.60.010—12.60.140 pertained to newsrack regulations and permits, and derived from Ord. No. 97-280, § 1, adopted 1997. For additional regulations pertaining to newsracks, the user's attention is directed to Chapter 17.04. 
 
12.60.010 - Short title. 
This chapter shall be known as the "Big Bear Lake Placement and Maintenance of Newsracks on Public Property Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2009-386, § 2, 3-23-2009)  
12.60.020 - Intent and purpose. 
The city council hereby finds and declares: 
A.  The city has significant interests in: (1) promoting vehicular traffic and pedestrian safety and convenience; (2) preventing damage to public sidewalks, structures, and landscaping; (3) preventing visual clutter, and (4) protecting the unique aesthetic and historical character of the "Village L." 
B.  The city has a substantial interest in promoting the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of its citizens, businesses and visitors by ensuring that public streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way in the city are not unreasonably obstructed by newsracks and that newsracks are properly maintained. 
C.  In recent years, the proliferation of newsracks on the streets and sidewalks of the city, in particular excessive, poorly maintained or abandoned newsracks, have contributed to the congestion of the city sidewalks, impeded the flow of pedestrian traffic, interfered with the use of streets, sidewalks and public rights-of-way, presented hazards to persons and property and resulted in substantial visual blight. 
D.  The city has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting the unique visual and aesthetic qualities of the city. To that end, and consistent with the city's general plan the city desires to take steps to reduce the visual blight, pedestrian inconvenience and hazards associated with an unlimited number and design of newsracks, poorly maintained newsracks and the unrestricted placement of newsracks on streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way in the city. 
E.  After extended inquiry by the city council and city staff, it has become clear that the most effective way to reduce the visual clutter and hazards associated with excessive numbers of newsracks and unregulated design or appearance of such newsracks is to prohibit the unlimited placement of private newsracks in the city and instead, institute a program to provide city-approved fixed pedestal newsracks of a consistent design, placement and color. 
F.  Thus, the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and welfare and the aesthetic qualities of the city by controlling the size, shape, construction and appearance of newsracks in the city, as a reasonable time, manner and place regulation, so as to: 
1.  Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience; 
2.  Ensure that there is no unreasonable interference with the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, including ingress and egress from any city residence, place of business or public facility, or any legally parked or stopped vehicles; 
3.  Ensure compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act and improve passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused by poorly-located newsracks; 
4.  Reduce visual blight and clutter and litter problems associated with poorly maintained or improperly located or abandoned newsracks; 
5.  Advance the economic interests of the city merchants and other information providers, including those involved in the publication and distribution of newspapers and periodicals through newsracks; 
6.  Protect the unique architectural, historical and aesthetic attributes of the city; 
7.  Reduce exposure of the city to personal injury or property damage claims and litigation; 
8.  Provide for public and property safety during emergency conditions; 
9.  Maintain and protect the values of surrounding properties; and 
10.  Provide reasonable access for the safe and efficient use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, delivery areas, loading zones, transit shelters, curb and handicapped ramps and other street furniture; 
G.  In adopting this chapter, the city council is mindful that newsrack regulations implicate rights protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 2 of the California Constitution. To that end, the city council hereby adopts these regulations and directs that their enforcement be conducted in a manner consistent with the constitutional rights of citizens and regulated parties. 
H.  Given the limited space available within the city's rights-of-way, the city has a substantial interest in devising a systematic approach to newsrack removal and placement in the city to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of newspapers and periodicals. The city council declares that this objective and the other aforementioned objectives are best achieved by adopting this chapter and creating regulations to allow fixed pedestal newsracks of a consistent design, placement and color and also by enhancing aesthetic character of public areas through uniformity in appearance. 
I.  The city council further declares that allowing only newsracks of a consistent design, placement and color in the city directly promotes the city's interests in promoting public safety, reducing visual blight and clutter, protecting the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the city and advancing the economic interests of the city merchants and other information providers.

B.  If a permit application for a specific geographic location is received and said geographic location complies with the standards set forth in section 12.60.100, and all other requirements of this chapter are met, said application shall be approved on a first come, first served basis, except that all applications accepted during the initial implementation program, described in subsection 12.60.070 A. of this chapter, shall be deemed pending as of the same date and time. If there is more than one application for a specific geographic location pending, then the priority for granting the applications shall be as set forth in subsection D. of this section. 
C.  If permit applications in excess of the number of potential locations that are then available are pending or if, during the time from October 1 to November 30, a permit application is made that would, if that permit were issued, create a number of newsracks in excess of the number of potential locations that are then available, then the priority for granting applications shall be as set forth in subsection D. of this section. Such priority shall not be granted with respect to any permit applied for during the remainder of the calendar year. 
D.  No applicant may be granted priority for a newsrack location for a publication at a location for which that specific publication has already been granted a permit or is part of a shared permit. Priority shall be given as follows:

5.  Within groups of applicants with the same frequency of publication and within groups of applicants not entitled to priority, permits shall be granted to the maximum allowable in a block by the drawing of lots as follows: the director shall assign the location at random by placing the name of all applicants for the remaining locations into a container from which the names shall be drawn, one at a time, by the director, until the remaining number of locations is filled. 
6.  The priority for granting a shared permit shall be based upon the frequency of publication of the primary applicant for the shared permit. 
7.  Any permit that cannot be granted on the unavailability of a location as set forth in this chapter shall instead be approved for a location on that block that complies with the requirements of this chapter that is in closest proximity to the requested location. 
E.  It shall be a condition of any permit granted according to a priority set forth in this section to maintain editions in the newsrack according to the frequency for which the priority was given.

(Ord. No. 2009-398, § 1, 11-23-2009)  
14.05.070 - FOG pretreatment required. 
Food service establishments are required to install, operate and maintain an approved type and adequately sized grease interceptor necessary to maintain compliance with the objectives of this chapter, subject to the variance and waiver provisions of section 14.05.080. The grease interceptor shall be adequate to separate and remove FOG contained in wastewater discharges from food service establishments prior to discharge to the sewer system. Fixtures, equipment, and drain lines located in the food preparation and clean up areas of food service establishments that are sources of FOG discharges shall be connected to the grease interceptor. Compliance shall be established as follows: 
A.  New Construction of Food Service Establishments. Newly constructed food service establishments shall install grease interceptors prior to commencing discharges of wastewater to the sewer system. 
B.  Existing Food Service Establishments. 
1.  For existing food service establishments, the requirement to install and to properly operate and maintain a grease interceptor may be conditionally stayed, that is, delayed in its implementation by the FOG control program manager for a maximum period of three years from the effective date of this chapter (three-year amortization period). Terms and conditions for application of a stay to a food service establishment shall be set forth in the permit. 
2.  Existing food service establishments, which have caused or contributed to grease-related blockage in the sewer system, or which have sewer laterals connected to hot spots, or which have been determined to contribute significant FOG to the sewer system by the FOG control program manager based on inspection or sampling, shall be deemed to have reasonable potential to adversely impact the sewer system, and shall install grease interceptors within 180 days upon notification by the city. 
3.  Existing food service establishments or food service establishments that change ownership, that undergo remodeling or a change in operations as defined in subsection 14.05.020 D.2., shall be required to install a grease interceptor. 
(Ord. No. 2009-398, § 1, 11-23-2009)  
14.05.080 - Variance and waiver of grease interceptor requirement. 
A.  Variance from Grease Interceptor Requirements. An existing food service establishment may obtain a variance from the grease interceptor requirement to allow alternative pretreatment technology that is, at least, equally effective in controlling the FOG discharge in lieu of a grease interceptor, if the food service establishment demonstrates that it is impossible or impracticable to install, operate or maintain a grease interceptor. The FOG control program manager's determination to grant a variance will be based upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions: 
1.  There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of a grease interceptor. 
2.  There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor and/or between the grease interceptor and the private collection lines or the public sewer. 
3.  The food service establishment can justify that the alternative pretreatment technology is equivalent or better than a grease interceptor in controlling its FOG discharge. In addition, the food service establishment must be able to demonstrate, after installation of the proposed alternative pretreatment, its effectiveness to control FOG discharge through downstream visual monitoring of the sewer system, for at least three months, at its own expense. A variance may be granted if the results show no visible accumulation of FOG in its lateral and/or tributary downstream sewer lines. 
B.  Conditional Waiver from Installation of Grease Interceptor. An existing food service establishment may obtain a conditional waiver from installation of a grease interceptor, if the food service establishment demonstrates that it has negligible FOG discharge and insignificant impact to the sewer system. Although a waiver from installation of grease interceptor may be granted, the food service establishment may be required to provide space and plumbing segregation for future installation of grease interceptor. The FOG control program manager's determination to grant or revoke a conditional waiver shall be based upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions: 
1.  Quantity of FOG discharge as measured or as indicated by the size of food service establishment based on seating capacity, number of meals served, menu, water usage, amount of on-site consumption of prepared food and other conditions that may reasonably be shown to contribute to FOG discharges. 
2.  Adequacy of implementation of best management practices and compliance history. 
3.  Sewer size, grade, condition based on visual information, FOG deposition in the sewer by the food service establishment, and history of maintenance and sewage spills in the receiving sewer system. 
4.  Changes in operations that significantly affect FOG discharge. 
5.  Any other condition deemed reasonably related to the generation of FOG discharges by the FOG control program manager. 
C.  Waiver from Grease Interceptor Installation with a Grease Disposal Mitigation Fee. For food service establishments where the installation of grease interceptor is not feasible and no equivalent alternative pretreatment can be installed, a waiver from the grease interceptor requirement may be granted with the imposition of a grease disposal mitigation fee as described in section 14.05.100. Additional requirements may be imposed to mitigate the discharge of FOG into the sewer system. The FOG control program manager's determination to grant the waiver with a grease disposal mitigation fee will be based upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions: 
1.  There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of a grease interceptor. 
2.  There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor and/or between the grease interceptor and the private collection lines or the public sewer. 
3.  A variance from grease interceptor installation to allow alternative pretreatment technology cannot be granted. 
D.  Application for Waiver or Variance of Requirement for Grease Interceptor. A food service establishment may submit an application for waiver or variance from the grease interceptor requirement to the FOG control program manager. The food service establishment bears the burden of demonstrating, to the FOG control program manager's reasonable satisfaction, that the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible or applicable. Upon determination by the FOG control program manager that reasons are sufficient to justify a variance or waiver, the permit will be issued or revised to include the variance or waiver and relieve the food service establishment from the requirement. 
E.  Terms and Conditions. A variance or waiver shall contain terms and conditions that serve as basis for its issuance. A waiver or variance may be revoked at any time when any of the terms and conditions for its issuance is not satisfied or if the conditions upon which the waiver was based change so that the justification for the waiver no longer exists. The waiver or variance shall be valid so long as the food service establishment remains in compliance with their terms and conditions until the expiration date specified in the variance or waiver. 
(Ord. No. 2009-398, § 1, 11-23-2009)  
14.05.090 - Commercial properties. 
Property owners of commercial properties or their official designee(s) shall be responsible for the installation and maintenance of the grease interceptor serving multiple food service establishments that are located on a single parcel. 
(Ord. No. 2009-398, § 1, 11-23-2009)  
14.05.100 - Grease disposal mitigation fee. 
Food service establishments that operate without a grease control interceptor may be required to pay an annual grease disposal mitigation fee to equitably cover the costs of increased maintenance of the sewer system as a result of the food service establishments' inability to adequately remove FOG from its wastewater discharge. This section shall not be interpreted to allow the new construction of, or existing food service establishments undergoing remodeling or change in operations to operate without an approved grease interceptor unless the city has determined that it is impossible or impracticable to install or operate a grease control interceptor for the subject facility under the provisions of section 14.05.150. 
A.  The grease disposal mitigation fee shall be based on the estimated annual increased cost of maintaining the sewer system for inspection and removal of FOG and other viscous or solidifying agents attributable to the food service establishment resulting from the lack of a grease interceptor or grease control device. 
B.  The grease disposal mitigation fee may be waived or reduced on a no less than an annual basis when the discharger demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the FOG control program manager that they had used best management and waste minimization practices on a regular basis that has significantly reduced the introduction of FOG into the sewer system. 
C.  The grease disposal mitigation fee may not be waived or reduced when the food service establishment does not comply with the minimum requirements of this chapter and/or its discharge into the sewer system in the preceding 12 months has caused or potentially caused or contributed alone or collectively, in sewer blockage or SSO in the sewer downstream, or surrounding the food service establishment prior to the waiver request. 
(Ord. No. 2009-398, § 1, 11-23-2009)  
14.05.110 - Sewer system overflows, public nuisance, abatement orders and cleanup costs. 
A.  Notwithstanding the three-year amortization period established in section 14.05.070, food service establishments found to have contributed to a sewer blockage, SSOs or any sewer system interferences resulting from the discharge of wastewater or waste containing FOG, shall be ordered to install and maintain a grease interceptor, and may be subject to a plan to abate the nuisance and prevent any future health hazards created by sewer line failures and blockages, SSOs or any other sewer system interferences. 
B.  SSOs may cause threat and injury to public health, safety, and welfare of life and property and are hereby declared public nuisances. 
C.  Sewer lateral failures and SSOs caused by food service establishments alone or collectively, are the responsibility of the private property owner or food service establishment, and individual(s) as a responsible officer or owner of the food service establishment. 
D.  If the city must act immediately to contain and clean up an SSO caused by blockage of a private or public sewer lateral or system serving a food service establishment, or at the request of the property owner or operator of the food service establishment, or because of the failure of the property owner or food service establishment to abate the condition causing immediate threat of injury to the health, safety, welfare, or property of the public, the city's costs for such abatement may be entirely borne by the property owner or operator of the food service establishment, and individual(s) as a responsible officer or owner of the food service establishment(s) and may constitute a debt to the city and become due and payable upon the city's request for reimbursement of such costs.

Chapter 15.64 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT  
ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
15.64.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and the general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the city council of Big Bear Lake does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.020 - Findings of fact. 
The city council hereby finds that there is a need to manage floodplains within the city to promote public health, safety and the general welfare of its citizens and finds the following: 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city of Big Bear Lake are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards, which increase flood heights and velocities, also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions. 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.040 - Methods of preventing flood loss. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

15.64.050 - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application: 
"Accessory use" means a use that is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
"Alluvial fan" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration. 
"Apex" means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front. 
"Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
"Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AN Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
"Area of special flood hazard"—See "Special flood hazard area." 
"Base flood" means a flood, which has a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter. 
"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade: i.e., below ground level—on all sides. 
"Building"—See "Structure." 
"Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
"Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
"Flood," "flooding," or "flood water" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
"Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
"Flood Hazard Boundary Map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards. 
"Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
"Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
"Floodplain" or "flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source—see "Flooding." 
"Floodplain Administrator" is designated as the city engineer of the city of Big Bear Lake who is appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning chapters, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose chapters (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
"Flood proofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents (refer to FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93 for guidelines on dry and wet flood proofing). 
"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "Regulatory Floodway." 
"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "Regulatory Floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Article IV., Appeal and Variance Procedure, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the reviewing authority will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use, which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities and port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
"Governing body" is the city council of the city of Big Bear Lake that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
"Hardship" as related to Article IV., Appeal and Variance Procedure, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The reviewing authority requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
A.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
B.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; or 
C.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs that have been approved by the Secretary of Interior. 
D.  Any structure designated by the city council as having historical significance to the residents of the city. 
"Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
"Levee system" means a flood protection system, which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition): 
A.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
1.  The wet flood-proofing standard in Section 15.64.170 (3)(c); 
2.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.64.170 (1); 
3.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.64.170 (2); 
4.  The standards for utilities in section 15.64.180. 
B.  For residential structures, all sub-grade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
"Manufactured home park" or "subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
"Market Value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation, which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
"New construction", for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city of Big Bear Lake, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city of Big Bear Lake. 
"Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
"One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood"—See "Base flood." 
"Public safety and nuisance" as it related to Section 15.64.100 of this chapter means that the granting of an exception must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle, which is: 
A.  Built on a single chassis; 
B.  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
C.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
D.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
"Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot. 
"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other effected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
"Sheet flow area"—See "Area of shallow flooding." 
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH. 
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
"Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
A.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
B.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter, pursuant to Article 1V of this chapter. 
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

This chapter applies to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city of Big Bear Lake. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.070 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated January 17, 1997 and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), dated March 18, 1996, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council of the city of Big Bear Lake by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at the city of Big Bear Lake Civic Center, 39707 Big Bear Boulevard, Big Bear Lake, CA 92315. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.080 - Compliance. 
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the term of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Big Bear Lake from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.090 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another chapter, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.100 - Interpretation. 
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

15.64.130 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
The city engineer is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.140 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit review. Review all development permits to determine that all of the following requirements have been met: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely effects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point. 
B.  Floodplain administrator's review, use and development of other base flood data: 
1.  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.64.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article III. Any such information shall be submitted to the city of Big Bear Lake for adoption as deemed appropriate by the floodplain administrator; or 
2.  If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas—A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995 in order to administer Article III. 
a.  Simplified method: 
i.  100-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication, or the discharge-drainage area method; and 
ii.  Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA; or 
b.  Detailed method: 
i.  100-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' HEC-HMS computer program; and 
ii.  Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' HEC-RAS computer program. 
C.  Notification of Other Agencies. In reviewing any development proposal that may result in the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, the floodplain administrative shall: 
1.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
2.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
3.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
4.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations. Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
5.  Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
D.  Documentation of floodplain development. The floodplain administrator shall obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available, as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Section 15.64.170 (C)(1) and 15.64.170 (C)(4) (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Section 15.64.170 (C)(2) (elevation or flood proofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  Certification required by Sections 15.64.170 (C)(3) (wet flood proofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Section 15.64.190 (B) (subdivision standards); 
5.  Certification required by Section 15.64.220 (A) (floodway encroachments); and 
6.  Reports required by Section 15.64.230 (mudflow standards). 
E.  Map determinations. The floodplain administrator shall make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. 
F.  Remedial action. The floodplain administrator shall take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.64.080. 
G.  Appeals. The city council of the city of Big Bear Lake shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

C.  Elevation and flood proofing. (See Section 15.64.050 definitions for "basement," "lowest floor," "new construction," "substantial damage" and "substantial improvement"): 
1.  For residential construction, including either new or substantial improvement, the lowest floor, including basement, shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  In an A zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated to at least one foot above the base flood elevation; said base flood elevation shall be determined by one of the methods in Section 15.64.160 (B)(2) of this chapter; 
b.  In all other zones, the lowest floor shall be elevated to at least one (1) foot above the base flood elevation; 
c.  Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the chief building official to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
2.  For nonresidential construction, including either new or substantial improvement, the lowest floor, including basement, shall either be elevated to conform with Section 15.64.170 (C)(1) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall meet the following requirements:

(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.200 - Floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.64.090 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
A.  Any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development, shall be prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If Section 15.647.220 (A) is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 15.64.200. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.210 - Mudslide (i.e. mudflow) prone areas. 
A.  The floodplain administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area. 
B.  Before issuing permits, development shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include but are not limited to the following: 
1.  Type and quality of soils; 
2.  Evidence of ground water or surface water problems; 
3.  Depth and quality of any fill; 
4.  Overall slope of the site; and 
5.  Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope. 
C.  Within areas that may have mudslide hazards, the floodplain administrator shall require that:

A.  The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas as known to the community. 
B.  Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard. 
C.  If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard. 
D.  Within Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, a setback is required for all new development from the lake, bay, stream or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
ARTICLE IV. - APPEAL AND VARIANCE PROCEDURE 
 
15.64.230 - Nature of Variances. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning laws that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.240 - Reviewing authority. 
A.  The planning commission of the city of Big Bear Lake shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. Any decision by the planning commission on any such matter may be appealed to the city council, whose decision on the matter shall be final. 
B.  The reviewing authority shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter, upon receipt of an appeal by the engineering division and the required fee as established by city council resolution. 
C.  In reviewing applications for appeals and variances, the reviewing authority shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following criteria: 
1.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
11.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
D.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. 2002-324 § 1(part), 2002)  
15.64.250 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Articles II and III of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "Historic Structures" (as defined in Article I of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" (as defined in Article I of this chapter), considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
E.  Variances shall be issued upon the determination by the reviewing authority of all the following: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in Article I of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create "nuisances" (as defined in Article I of this chapter), cause "fraud or victimization" (as defined in Article I of this chapter) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or chapters. 
F.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 15.64.270 (A) through (E) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
G.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.64.260 (C), and the purposes of this chapter, the reviewing authority may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
H.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the city engineer that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain board in the office of the San Bernardino County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the effected parcel of land.

Chapter 15.68 - GROWTH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, adopted May 11, 2009, amended Chapter 15.68 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, Chapter 15.68 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 97-276, § 1, adopted 1997. 
 
15.68.010 - Purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter: 
A.  To establish a responsible growth management program for the city; 
B.  To ensure that growth and related infrastructure are managed and coordinated to provide adequate levels of service in order to preserve the city's quality of life, community character, natural resources, and the health, safety, and welfare of its inhabitants; 
C.  To establish an equitable financing plan to pay for infrastructure improvements based on the development impacts that are created and the benefits that are received; and 
D.  To establish a mechanism for monitoring the effectiveness of this chapter by providing relevant information and reports to the city council and general public, and by periodically updating and revising this chapter when appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
15.68.020 - Establishment of a growth management program. 
The city council establishes a growth management program. The program shall include: 
A.  A projection of future development based on the general plan's land use policies and data on building and occupancy permits form the building and safety department to be reviewed periodically and revised as necessary; 
B.  A development impact plan (hereafter called "the plan") that consists of an inventory of projected future impacts from development, proposed improvements, and their corresponding costs; and 
C.  A determination for impact fees for both residential and commercial/industrial development projects that will finance the projected costs of associated impacts listed in the plan. 
(Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
15.68.030 - Projection of future development. 
The 1990 estimated projection of future development through the year 2010 is 3,500 additional dwelling units, 12,500 total dwelling units, 1,500,000 additional commercial/industrial square footage, 3,000,000 total commercial/industrial square footage. 
For the purposes of this chapter, "dwelling units" shall be defined to include one-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings, condominiums and apartments. Commercial square footage shall include hotels and motels. 
(Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
15.68.040 - Five-year anticipated demand for residential development. 
A.  The intent of this section is to ensure that growth and related infrastructure are coordinated over the 20-year horizon of this chapter to provide adequate levels of service consistent with the purposes of this chapter. Residential development and related impacts are not expected to occur in a straight-line numerical pattern over the 20-year period addressed in this chapter. Consequently, an annual limit or target for residential development will not be in harmony with typical market conditions and could counteract necessary and beneficial economic growth. 
This section identifies an appropriate average level of residential development and then allows new residential construction to fluctuate within a five-year period while generally maintaining the overall average. At times, residential development may exceed the yearly average but may likely be offset by other years when development may be less than average. 
When it appears that the five-year average will be exceeded in any five-year period, the city council will consider taking corrective actions. The absolute limit on residential development for any five-year period cannot exceed 25 percent more than the anticipated average without the implementation of such corrective actions. 
Commercial development is not limited in any given year or five-year period. The amounts of commercial and residential development are closely correlated. Therefore, pacing residential development also indirectly paces commercial development. 
B.  The anticipated five-year demand for residential development is projected to be 1,100 additional dwelling units. This number is established by dividing the total 20-year projected residential development by four and adding approximately 25 percent. 
C.  The number of new dwelling units issued building permits between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 1996, and every five-year period thereafter, shall not exceed 1,100. No carryover shall be permitted from one five-year period to another. 
D.  Housing affordable to very-low income and/or low-income households shall not be counted towards this limit provided suitable guarantees are made to the satisfaction of the city attorney that such housing remains affordable to very-low-income and/or low-income households for a minimum of 45 years for owner occupied units, and 55 years for rental units. 
E.  Dwelling units shall not be counted towards the totals specified in this section if: 
1.  The dwelling units are remodeled with no increase in number of dwelling units; or 
2.  The dwelling units are demolished and a building permit obtained within 12 months from the date a demolition permit is finalized for replacement with no increase in the number of dwelling units. 
F.  Upon issuance of the building permit for the 875th new dwelling unit to be constructed during any such five-year period, the city council shall convene to review development trends, projected future development, infrastructure capacity, and projected structure enhancements. Within six months of such building permit issuance, the city council shall take appropriate action including but not limited to accelerating construction of infrastructure and, if necessary, reducing permitted development. It is the city's intent to assure that existing and projected infrastructure capacity will keep pace with and be adequate to serve existing and anticipated development. 
G.  For calendar year 1991, all unused 1991 equivalent dwelling units (EDU's) pursuant to repealed chapters 2.13 and 15.44 of this Code (previous growth management ordinance), and all carryover EDUs from 1990, shall be permitted. On January 1, 1992, any remaining URDUs will no longer be permitted. 
(Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
15.68.060 - Impact fees—Nexus provision. 
A.  Structure size and average daily trips (or a combination of both) shall be used where appropriate to link the impact fees and the plan contained in this chapter in a rational manner. 
B.  The city council hereby adopts the impact fee report set forth in exhibit "A", attached to the ordinance adopting this chapter and incorporated by reference herein. The impact fee report shall be kept on file with the city clerk and available for public inspection and, upon payment of the applicable copying charge, photocopying. 
(Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
15.68.070 - Reserved.  
15.68.080 - Impact fees—Applicability. 
A.  Every applicant constructing or causing to be constructed any project that is habitable or leasable within the city shall pay an impact fee computed as set forth by the city. This impact fee shall be in addition to all other fees and charges required by the city. 
B.  The remodeling of any existing structure that results in additional square footage shall be subject to impact fees on the additional new square footage only. The remodeling of any existing residence shall be subject to the square footage portion of the residential impact fee for any square footage that exceeds the existing square footage. No per unit impact fee shall apply to such remodeling. 
C.  For all projects involving the voluntary demolition or destruction by natural disaster of an existing structure, an impact fee shall be required only for the square footage of a new structure on that lot or parcel that exceeds that which was demolished or destroyed. For residential projects, the per unit impact fees shall only be required for the number of new dwelling units on that lot or parcel that exceeds that which was demolished or destroyed. These provisions shall only apply provided that the square footage of the structure(s) and number of dwelling units is established by the property owner and approved by the chief building official in writing at the time of demolition or destruction and that building permits are issued within seven years from the date of issuance of a demolition permit or the date of the natural disaster, whichever is earlier. The burden of proof demonstrating the existing square footage and number of dwelling units of a demolished or destroyed structure shall rest with the applicant. If building permits are not issued within the specified time period then impact fees shall be required for all square footage and each dwelling unit constructed regardless of the size and use of the original structure(s). 
D.  The city council hereby adopts the schedule of development impact fees by type of fee ("fee schedule") set forth in the impact fee report, with the exception of parkland acquisition and improvements impact fees. This exception is reflected in exhibit "B", attached to the ordinance adopting this chapter and incorporated by reference herein. The adopted impact fees may be revised from time to time by resolution of the city council, in accordance with state law. The fee schedule may be adjusted by resolution, pursuant to section 15.68.110, to be effective on July 1 of each year (or sooner as directed by city council), with this section being considered as enabling and directive in compliance with the Mitigation Fee Act, Government Code Section 66000 et seq. 
E.  The city council hereby adopts the five-year phasing plan set forth in exhibit "C", attached to the ordinance adopting this chapter and incorporated by reference herein. Each increase shall automatically become effective on July 1 of each year, commencing July 1, 2010 and continuing thereafter, unless expressly modified by the city council. 
F.  The impact fees imposed by the ordinance adopting this chapter shall only apply to those impact fees described herein. Except as expressly modified by the ordinance adopting this chapter, all other development impact fees, community development and user service fees adopted by the city council pursuant to prior city ordinances or resolutions, as they may be amended from time to time, or any future ordinances or resolutions adopted for such purposes, shall remain in full force and effect. 
(Ord. No. 2009-389, § 1, 5-11-2009; Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
15.68.090 - Impact fees—Collection and transfer to account. 
A.  The finance division shall establish a separate interest-bearing growth management fund. Interest earned by the fund shall be credited to the fund and shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this chapter or in the resolution of the city council establishing development impact fees. 
B.  The finance division shall maintain and keep accurate financial records for the growth management fund which shall show the source of all funds and all disbursements. The finance division shall ensure that the disbursement of funds from the fund shall be used solely and exclusively for the projects specified in the plan. 
C.  Any funds collected prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, pursuant to repealed chapter 15.44 of this Code, shall not be transferred to the growth management fund referenced in this section, but shall be use only to offset the cost of improvements authorized by this Code at the time of collection. 
D.  Impact fees established in this chapter or established by city council resolution adopted pursuant to this chapter shall become effective no sooner than 60 days following the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or the resolution establishing such fee, or at such later time as may be established in such ordinance or resolution. Those impact fees set forth in exhibit "B" shall become effective on September 1, 2009. 
E.  The final determination of the amount of impact fees to be paid by the applicant shall be made by the city engineer. Appeals of the decision of the city engineer shall be made directly to the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
15.68.100 - Impact fee reductions. 
A.  Any portion of a impact fee may be appealed to the city council within 30 days following the date the applicant is first notified by the city of the amount of the impact fee. An impact fee waiver, in whole or in part, may be approved by the city council if the council finds that the actual cost for a future public improvement as estimated by the city council and used in computing the impact fee will be reduced by the proposed development project. If an applicant constructs improvements identified on the master facilities plan, the applicant shall receive a credit on all costs associated with the improvements, based on a determination by the city engineer of the actual and reasonable costs to the applicant of providing the improvements. The city manager is authorized to enter into standard fee credit agreements with such applicants, setting forth the terms upon which such credits shall be granted. 
Upon council approval, the impact fee shall be-reduced by an amount equal to the reduction in cost of the public improvement. The burden of proof demonstrating this relationship rests with the applicant. 
B.  Under special circumstances and upon recommendation of the planning commission, the city council may reduce or waive the impact fee for a proposed development project as an incentive to encourage land uses that will provide exceptional benefits to the city. In extraordinary cases, an impact fee waiver, in whole or in part, may be approved if the city council finds any of the following: 
1.  That the proposed development project will provide exceptional economic, aesthetic, or recreational benefits to the city; or 
2.  That the proposed development project will provide exceptional housing opportunities for very-low-income and/or low-income persons; or 
3.  That the proposed development project will significantly improve a blighted area within the boundaries of any improvement agency project area. 
C.  Prior to approving any impact fee reduction or waiver pursuant to subsection B., the city council must find that other city resources are available to offset the impact fee reduction or waiver, must delineate those resources, and must direct the administrative services department to transfer to the growth management fund account such equivalent resources. 
(Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
15.68.110 - Yearly revisions to development limits, cost of development impacts, improvement projects and impact fees. 
A.  The city council shall review the anticipated demand for residential development, the projection of future development, costs of development impacts, and proposed improvements and shall consider future and alternate development impacts, development limits, infrastructure improvements, and costs annually and shall adopt any necessary amendments to this chapter or to any resolution of the city council establishing impact fees pursuant to this chapter, after public hearing. 
B.  After the close of each calendar year and under the authority of the city manager, staff shall adjust the estimated cost of development impacts based on engineering news record's construction cost index (Los Angeles Region) and subsequently recommend a revision to the impact fees accordingly. The city manager shall present recommendations to the city council in the form of an annual report. All recommendations shall be in terms of calendar year calculations. 
C.  The city council may adopt additional adjustments to those presented by staff pursuant to subsection B. However, any changes that increase or reduce staff's adjustments in impact fees must be accompanied by nexus findings. 
(Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
15.68.120 - Administration. 
A.  The city manager shall be responsible for assuring the timely administration of all provisions of this chapter. A growth management capital improvement plan (hereafter referred to as "GMCIP") shall be prepared detailing the specific improvements identified in section 15.68.050 along with a time frame for implementation and a financing plan. This GMCIP shall be separately identifiable and may be incorporated into the citywide capital improvement plan or prepared separately, as deemed appropriate by the city manager. The GMCIP shall be submitted to the city council for review and approval. The city council shall annually conduct a public hearing to determine those capital projects to be funded by the impact fees collected under the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  The city council is hereby authorized to make inter-fund transfers and loans between capital facilities accounts into which are deposited impact fees upon those reasonable terms of repayment and interest rates as determined by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2009-388, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
Chapter 15.70 - FIRE SUPPRESSION DEVELOPMENT FEE PROGRAM 
 
15.70.000 - Findings. 
The city council finds as follows: 
A.  Pursuant to Article 11, Section 7 of the California Constitution, the city of Big Bear Lake is empowered to enact measures that protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. 
B.  The development of residential, commercial and industrial property in the city of Big Bear Lake will create increased calls for fire protection services. As a result, new fire suppression facilities, vehicles and equipment will be needed to maintain current levels of service and maintain safe emergency response times within the city. 
C.  The city council finds that the proposed fire suppression facilities, vehicles and equipment are identified in Chapter 6 of the "Development Impact Fee Calculation and Nexus Report and Master Facilities Plan for Big Bear Lake, CA" ("Report") and are necessary to provide fire protection services to the city of Big Bear Lake. 
D.  The city council further finds that the fire suppression development fee program is necessary to establish administrative regulations and authority for a funding mechanism for the acquisition and construction of fire suppression facilities, vehicles and equipment, as these are identified in the report, and is necessary to provide funding to maintain adequate fire protection services to the residences and businesses of the city of Big Bear Lake. 
E.  With regard to the methodology for levying the fire suppression development fee, the city council further finds that: 
1.  The report describes in detail the number of fire calls for service that typical single and multiple family residential, commercial/office and industrial uses generate, the expanded fire suppression facilities, vehicles and equipment required to service new development in the city and the estimated costs of those facilities, vehicles and equipment. 
2.  The estimated cost for the fire suppression facilities, vehicles and equipment as described in the reports is based upon current construction costs for similar facilities constructed in the city of Big Bear Lake and comparable cities and current acquisition costs. Although the report was prepared in February of 2002, the city council finds that the construction and acquisition costs identified are less than or equal to current construction and acquisition costs. As such, use of the 2002 report is reasonable and will not lead to charges that exceed the reasonable costs for providing the services. The city council finds that the method for estimating the costs of is reasonably based on a square footage basis and will not exceed the reasonably estimated total of these costs. 
3.  The land use element of the general plan and Development Code of the city of Big Bear Lake specify the permitted uses of land within the city and place limits on the intensity and density of development. The city council has reviewed the relationship between land uses and densities permitted and the rate and amount of actual development within the city. The city council has identified trends in growth and development which enable the city council to project, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the extent of future development and the impacts such development will have on public safety services, including fire protection. 
4.  The city council has also examined the extent to which different land uses generate demands for public safety services and have taken into consideration, among other evidence, the information contained in the report discussing such demand generators. 
5.  The city council also finds that the costs of the fire suppression facilities, vehicles and equipment and personnel costs, as described in the report and as proposed to be funded by the fire suppression development fee, are apportioned relative to the anticipated impacts created by new development within the city of Big Bear Lake, and that the fees are fairly apportioned on individual residential dwelling units and proposed commercial/industrial development on a square footage basis throughout the city on the basis of benefits conferred on property proposed for development and the need for such facilities created by such development. 
6.  The facts and evidence establish that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the fire suppression facilities, vehicles and equipment and the types of development upon which the fee will be imposed, and that there is a reasonable relationship between the fee's use and the types of development for which the fee is charged. These relationships are described in more detail in the report. 
7.  The facts and evidence further establish that there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fees collected and the costs of the fire suppression facilities, vehicles and equipment attributable to the development for with the fire suppression development fee is imposed. This relationship is described in more detail in the report. 
F.  The fire suppression development fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used only to finance the fire suppression facilities, vehicles and equipment described and identified in the report. 
G.  It is the intent of the city council to adopt a fair and equitable method of securing the necessary revenues to fund the fire suppression facilities, vehicles and equipment, including the construction costs to accommodate expansions in existing fire stations.

1.  The owner has constructed the improvements, or portions thereof, that are identified in the master facility plan; 
2.  The city required that the improvements be constructed to contain supplemental size, capacity, number or length for the benefit of property not within the owner's project; 
3.  The city approved, prior to construction or furnishing, the proposed budget for the project and finds any change to that budget fair and reasonable;

The city council is empowered to grant deferrals or waivers of any fee imposed by this chapter upon request, after notice and hearing, if in the opinion of the city council, properly supported by specific findings, deferral would allow a better or more fair financing arrangement to be developed and imposed, or where waiver is required because imposition of such fee or fees would cause undue hardship. Findings must include facts supporting deferral or waiver including, without limitation, findings that in the case of deferral: (1) other properties to be benefited by any fee will not be burdened by the review and delay in fee imposition, or (2) alternative financing methods involving more than one owner have been proposed for review, and (3) delay will result in a more fair funding arrangement; and, in the case of waiver the owner will receive little or no benefit from the fee imposed and would therefore be required, if the fee were imposed, to pay more than his/her fair share for the benefit received. 
(Ord. 2005-347 § 2(part), 2005)  
15.70.080 - Application to subsequently annexed land. 
As areas not presently situated within the city boundaries seek to annex to the city, the city council shall determine the benefit to such land areas of the public facilities and infrastructure funded by this chapter. The city council may then impose the fire suppression development fee, in whole or in part, as established by this chapter, upon such annexed areas to the extent necessary to assure that such areas pay their fair share of the actual costs of the fire suppression facilities, vehicles or equipment that benefit their projects, unless the city council determines that such an imposition would cause inequities or that a better or fairer financing arrangement can and should be developed and imposed.

Chapter 15.72 - CHANGES OF USE OF MOBILEHOME PARKS 
 
15.72.010 - Findings and declaration of purpose. 
Mobilehome owners make considerable investments in purchasing, maintaining, and improving their mobilehomes, but must rent a space for the home in a mobilehome park and cannot easily move the mobilehome due to the high cost and risk of damage involved in moving a mobilehome. Further, park owners prefer to rent any vacant spaces to new homes and frequently refuse to rent a space to a homeowner wishing to relocate a home that is not new. In recognition of the unique situation and vulnerability of mobilehome owners created by these facts, the State Mobilehome Residency Law, Civil Code Section 798, et seq. and Government Code Sections 65863.7 and 66427.4, limit the grounds on which mobilehome owners may be evicted from a mobilehome park, protect their right to sell their mobilehomes in place in a mobilehome park and authorize local jurisdictions to impose reasonable measures to mitigate the adverse impacts on displaced mobilehome owners when a mobilehome park closes or converts to another use. Pursuant to these state laws, this chapter provides a procedure and standards for reviewing applications for change of use and closure of mobilehome parks, determining reasonable mitigation measures and protecting residents from tactics such as intimidation, designed to pressure mobilehome owners to relocate without receiving assistance pursuant to this chapter. Without such assistance mobilehome owners may lose the investment in their homes, which may be their only asset, and may not be able to relocate to decent, affordable housing.

Approval of a change of use shall become null and void if the notice of "Termination of Tenancy" has not been given within the time provided in Section 15.72.070 and relocation pursuant to the conditions of approval has not occurred within twelve months of the effective date of the resolution approving the change of use, unless otherwise extended as provided in subsection B of this section or unless otherwise provided in the resolution approving it. 
B.  Upon application by the park owner filed with the director on or before the time provided for giving the notice of termination or the expiration of the approval of the change of use, the date for giving notice and the approval may be extended by the city council upon a showing of good cause. The request may be denied if the council finds that the park owner has unreasonably delayed implementation of the mitigation measures or that further delay will result in prejudice or further adverse impacts upon eligible residents remaining in the park. Approval of an extension may be conditioned on reasonable measures designed to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from the delay. The application for extension shall be subject to the notice and hearing procedures set forth in Section 15.72.080 (A).

C.  Revision of Map After Filing. A revised tentative map may be submitted at any time prior to action on the map by the advisory agency, subject to the provisions of the subdivision manual, Chapter 3. 
D.  Advisory Agency Actions.

i.  Responsibility of Subdivision Committee. The subdivision committee shall hold at least one meeting on each tentative tract map filed, and as many additional meetings as may be necessary, with the subdivider or his agent.

The report shall contain such factual and technical information as the committee may deem to be of interest or assistance to the planning commission or to any other interested person, officer, department, municipality, district or agency. Such report shall also include the recommendations of the subdivision committee and shall be made available to any interested person, officer, department, municipality, district or agency.

ii.  If the preliminary soils report identifies the existence of critically expansive soils or other soils problems which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, the advisory agency may approve the subdivision or a portion thereof if it is documented that recommended corrective action is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure to be constructed. A condition to the issuance of any building permit may require that the approved recommended action be incorporated in the construction of each structure. 
iii.  The requirements imposed upon the subdivision would not render unfeasible the development of housing for all segments of the economic community and that the effect of any actions on the map considers the housing needs of the region and is balanced against the public service needs of its residents and available fiscal and environmental resources.

Such action shall include a condition that a final map or parcel map of the subject parcel of land shall not be recorded until the appropriate zoning regulations have become effective. 
e.  Report to Subdivider of Advisory Agency Action. The approval, conditional approval, or denial of the tentative map by the advisory agency shall be reported, in writing, directly to the subdivider. This requirement shall be deemed to have been complied with when a report of the advisory agency's action has been placed in the mail directed to the subdivider at his designated address and bearing the proper postage.

Upon the completion of such notification, the tentative map shall have been officially withdrawn. Any charges accrued for case processing shall be determined and the appropriate refund or balance paid. 
F.  Time Limits for Recording. Within a period of thirty-six months after the date of the approval or conditional approval of the tentative map by the advisory agency, or on appeal by the city council, the subdivider shall cause the subdivision, or any part thereof, to be surveyed, and a final map to be prepared in accordance with the tentative map as approved, and filed in accordance with Section 66452.6(d) of the Subdivision Map Act. Upon written application of the subdivider, extension not exceeding a total of three additional years may be granted by the advisory agency or on appeal to the city council.

Chapter 16.18 - PARK AND RECREATION DEDICATION AND FEES 
Sections: 
 
16.18.010 - Park and recreation dedication and fees.

(Ord. No. 2009-389, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
16.18.020 - Definitions. 
The following definitions shall govern the meaning of words in this chapter, unless from the context in which the word is used, a different meaning is clearly intended: 
A.  "Park" means a parcel or contiguous parcels of land which is owned, operated and maintained by a public agency or private association and which provides recreational land and facilities for the benefit and enjoyment of the residents of the subdivision and of persons residing, working or visiting in the city. Parks may be classified as community parks, including community centers, athletic facilities, large multiuse swimming pools, picnic areas, cultural centers or similar facilities; public neighborhood parks, including playground equipment, sports fields, and picnic areas; and private neighborhood parks, generally intended to serve only the immediate subdivision/development or specified planned community in which they are located. Parks may also include, or be limited to open space areas suitable for active or passive uses. 
B.  "Park and recreational facilities" means any public improvements deemed necessary by the city to develop, improve or rehabilitate land and facilities for park and recreational purposes. Such improvements may include but not be limited to grading; landscaped areas for active and passive recreational use, open space and sports fields; irrigation and drainage systems; lawn, shrubs and trees; facilities for recreational community gardening; walkways; bicycle facilities and park lighting; playground or other recreational equipment; picnic facilities; community center or other buildings, swimming pools; volleyball, basketball, tennis, racquetball and other courts; vehicle driveways and parking areas and any other facilities which may hereafter be authorized by state law or approved by the city. 
C.  "Private open space" means that privately owned land and facilities for park and recreation purposes provided within a subdivision and perpetually maintained and operated by the future residents or owners of the subdivision, which land and facilities can be credited against the dedication and payment requirements established in this chapter, when the following criteria are met: 
1.  That the private land meet a minimum size requirement of one-third-acre; 
2.  That the proposed private park land be reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location of the private park land; 
3.  That the following areas or subdivision design features shall not be eligible for private park credit; yards, court areas, setbacks, subdivision edges, landscaped subdivision entries, greenbelts, meandering streams and circulation improvements such as bicycle, hiking, equestrian trails and detention/retention basins; 
4.  That the location of the land provide convenient access to housing and schools; 
5.  That the perpetual private ownership and maintenance of the land is adequately provided for by a recorded written agreement, approved as to form by the city attorney; and 
6.  That the use of the private park land is perpetually restricted for park and recreational purposes, which restriction cannot be defeated or eliminated without the written consent of the city council and in no event without providing equivalent park and recreational space elsewhere in the subdivision. 
D.  "Fair market value" means the value of the land being subdivided based upon the current assessed value, modified to equal market value in accordance with the current practice of the county assessor, or at the option of the city based upon an appraisal by a qualified appraiser selected by city. In the event the subdivider disagrees with this fair market value determination, the subdivider may select a qualified appraiser who, together with the original appraiser, shall select a third qualified appraiser. The three appraisers so selected shall conduct a fair market value analysis of the property and their determination shall be binding upon the city and the subdivider for the purposes of this chapter. All costs of appraisal shall be paid by the subdivider prior to the recordation of any final map or the issuance of any building permit. The fair market value shall be determined as of the time the final map or parcel map is filed. With regard to any park and recreation improvements or equipment provided by the subdivider, the fair market value shall be the actual and reasonable costs to acquire, construct or install the improvement or equipment. 
(Ord. No. 2009-389, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
16.18.030 - Standards for determining dedication/maximum requirement. 
A.  General. If the park dedication is required under section 16.18.030, the park area required shall be determined in accordance with the standards provided in this section. 
B.  Standard Set By Resolution in Amount Not To Exceed Formula of Park Area to Population. The amount of park area required to be dedicated by a subdivider shall be as set forth by resolution of the city council, as such resolution may be amended from time to time, based upon the findings and determinations of the city that the amount of dedicated park land required by the resolution will serve the public interest, convenience, health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city. 
However, said resolution shall not require the dedication of land in excess of three acres of property for every 1,000 persons residing within the city to be devoted to local park and recreational purposes. Said ratio of .003 is hereafter referred to as the "maximum park area standard." 
C.  Dwelling Unit Occupancy Factor. Based upon the latest available census data, the dwelling unit occupancy factors shall be as follows: 2.336 for detached dwelling units, 2.165 for attached dwelling units, and 2.331 for mobile home dwelling units. These figures may be revised from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
D.  Computation of Maximum Area of Park That May Be Required To Be Dedicated. The maximum amount of park land the city may require for any subdivision shall be determined by multiplying the number of dwelling units in the subdivision for each housing type by the occupancy factor for each housing type by .003 (i.e. the ratio of the maximum park area standard of three acres per 1,000 population). This is represented as follows: 
Area of park to be dedicated = (# of dwelling units) × (occupancy factor) × (.003) 
The city council, by resolution may require a dedication of park land less than the maximum amount set forth above if the city finds that a smaller dedication will serve the public interest, convenience, health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city. 
E.  Qualification of Land Being Dedicated. In addition to meeting the requirements set forth in this section, any land offered for park dedication shall, in the city's opinion, meet the criteria specified in subsection 16.18.060 D. 
(Ord. No. 2009-389, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
16.18.050 - Standards for determining impact fees/maximum fee. 
When required by section 16.18.060, the subdivider shall pay to the city a fee in lieu of making such dedication. The fee shall be set by resolution of the city council, as said resolution may be amended from time to time, based upon the findings and determinations of the city that the amount of fees required by the resolution will serve the public interest, convenience, health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city. 
Notwithstanding the above, the maximum fee that the city may require a subdivider to pay to the city pursuant to this chapter shall be computed by multiplying the area of park to be dedicated under subsection 16.18.040 D. by the fair market value of the land being developed. 
(Ord. No. 2009-389, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
16.18.060. - Determination of dedication, fees or combinations. 
A.  Impact Fee Generally Required. Where required by the city, or where no park or recreational facility located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision is designated in the general plan of the city, a specific plan, or other adopted resolution policy or standard of the city, the subdivider shall pay an impact fee computed in accordance with section 16.18.050 to be used for park and recreational purposes to serve the residents of the area being subdivided and other members of the public. 
B.  Dedication In Lieu Of Impact Fee. Where a park or recreational facility has been designated in the general plan of the city, a specific plan, or other adopted resolution policy or standard of the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision and other members of the public, the city may require the subdivider to dedicate land for a park and provide recreational facilities thereon, in lieu of payment of an impact fee as provided in this chapter if the city determines that dedication and provision is desirable as provided in this section. If the fair market value of the park and recreational facilities provided is less than the dedication or in lieu fees otherwise required hereunder, the difference shall be paid by the subdivider as an impact fee. 
C.  Combination of Land and Fees. The city may accept a combination of land, recreational facilities and fees, with the respective amounts to be determined in the sole discretion of city, so long as the aggregate fair market value of the land and recreational facilities plus in lieu fees does not exceed the limits established in this chapter. 
D.  Determination of Land or Fee. Whether the city requires payment of an impact fee, or accepts land dedication in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall, in the city's sole discretion, be determined by consideration of the following: 
1.  The provisions of the city's general plan, any specific plan adopted thereto, and any other adopted resolution, policy or regulation of the city; 
2.  Topography, geology, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication; 
3.  Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication; 
4.  The feasibility of dedication; 
5.  Access and location of other park sites to subdivision; and 
6.  Need of other accessible park sites for development, improvement and rehabilitation. 
The determination of the city as to whether an impact fee shall be charged or land shall be dedicated, or a combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive. 
E.  Impact Fees for Subdivisions of 50 Parcels or Less. If the subdivision contains 50 parcels or less, only the payment of impact fees may be required, except that condominium, stock cooperative or community apartment projects may be required to dedicate land if they have more than 50 dwelling units, notwithstanding the fact that the number of parcels may be less than 50. 
(Ord. No. 2009-389, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
16.18.070 - Subdivider credits. 
A.  Public Parks. The subdivider shall receive a credit against the impact fee payment or park dedication requirement for the fair market value of any land dedicated and for the value of any park and recreation improvements provided by the subdivider in conjunction with any public park. The value of such improvements shall be determined by the city engineer. 
B.  Private Park. In conjunction with any planned development, real estate development, stock cooperative, community apartment or condominium, as defined by state law, if the subdivider provides private open space as defined in section 16.18.020, then the subdivider may receive a credit equal to the fair market value of the private open space against the park dedication requirement of this chapter, but such credit shall not exceed one-third of such impact fee payment or park dedication requirement. The actual amount of such credit shall be determined by the city based upon the comparability of the private open space to public park area and the adequacy of such private open space to serve the needs of the subdivision for active recreational areas. 
C.  Application of Credit. The credits provided in this section shall be applied to reduce the subdivider's obligation to dedicate and/or pay an impact fee as required under this chapter, but only to the extent of such credit. 
(Ord. No. 2009-389, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
16.18.080 - Disposition of land or fees. 
The amount and location of land to be dedicated or the impact fee to be paid shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision. In accordance with Government Code Section 66477, it is expressly acknowledged that the land to be dedicated or impact fees to be paid may be for both neighborhood and community parks. Impact fees paid by a subdivider pursuant to this chapter may be spent to develop, improve and rehabilitate community and neighborhood parks even though such parks may be used by nonresidents of the subdivision, so long as the benefit of the park and recreational facilities to residents of the subdivision is reasonable in relation to the location of the parks and amount of the impact fees. 
(Ord. No. 2009-389, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
16.18.090 - Time of payment of impact fees or land dedication. 
All park impact fees shall be paid directly to the city cashier upon the date of final inspection, or the date the certificate of occupancy is issued, whichever occurs last, provided that the city may require payment on a pro rata basis for each dwelling or upon a percentage of dwelling when they have received final inspection or certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs last. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may require earlier payment of such fees if necessary to reimburse the city for previous expenditures or if the fees are collected for park and recreation improvements where the city has established an account, appropriated funds, and adopted a construction schedule or plan for the park and recreation improvements prior to final inspection or certification of occupancy. In the event of dedication, dedication shall be made at the time of recordation of the final map. 
(Ord. No. 2009-389, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
16.18.100 - Schedule of performance. 
A.  City Schedule. The community development director shall prepare and maintain a schedule specifying how, when and where land or impact fees, or both, which were dedicated to the city to develop park or recreational facilities will be used. Any impact fees collected under this chapter shall be committed within five years after the payment of such fees or the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If any fees are not so committed, they shall be distributed to subdivision owners in accordance with law. 
B.  Subdivider's Schedule. In the event that subdivider improves or develops parks for public or private ownership, the subdivider shall prepare a schedule specifying when, how and where such subdivider will develop the park or recreational facilities to serve the residents of the subdivision. This schedule will be required as a condition of subdivision map approval. 
(Ord. No. 2009-389, § 2, 5-11-2009)  
16.18.110 - Procedure. 
A.  Approval of Subdivision Map. Unless otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, any decision or action required by city in this chapter, shall be made after the duly noticed public hearing at the time of approval of the tentative tract map or parcel map, by the city planning commission. Such decision or action shall be made a condition of approval of the subdivision map. 
B.  Appeals. Any person may appeal a determination of the planning commission made pursuant to this chapter to the city council.

17.01.020 - Intent and purpose of Development Code. 
This Development Code provides for the creation of zones in the incorporated area and sphere of influence of the city of Big Bear Lake, and prescribes classes of uses, area requirements, and standards of development for buildings, structures, improvements and premises in said zones.

B.  To protect the physical, social, and economic stability of residential, commercial, recreational, and other land uses within the city to assure its orderly and beneficial development; 
C.  To protect existing residents and property owners from the adverse effects of incompatible uses, while allowing for the infill and redevelopment of areas at a scale and character compatible with surrounding properties; 
D.  To accommodate expansion of development into vacant and under-utilized lands, while considering environmental and infrastructural conditions; 
E.  To permit a variety of businesses so as to strengthen economic vitality; 
F.  To reduce hazards to the public resulting from the inappropriate location, use, or design of buildings and other improvements; 
G.  To conserve significant natural resources; 
H.  To ensure compliance with applicable county, state, and federal laws and regulations; and

To establish Big Bear Lake as a safe community with a high quality of life for residents, a diverse economic base, an aesthetically pleasing appearance in keeping with the natural mountain environment, and adequate infrastructure to serve present and future needs, while maintaining and enhancing its character as a year-round destination resort and recreation area. 
(Ord. 2003-333 § 4 (Exh. A (part), 2003))  
17.01.030 - Consistency of Development Code with general plan. 
A.  In accordance with California Government Code Section 65403(c), which requires that local jurisdictions implement their general plans once adopted, this Development Code is intended to implement the city of Big Bear Lake general plan adopted by Resolution No. 99-36 on August 3, 1999. As stated in the general plan, "the Development Code is the primary tool for implementing the general plan . . . .[by regulating] development through the creation of zone districts shown on the zoning map, with accompanying text which outlines the permitted uses allowed and development standards required within each zone." 
B.  Adoption of this Development Code is consistent with Policy L1.2 of the general plan Land Use Element, which states that the city will "Ensure that the zoning map, Development Code, specific plans, and other applicable development-related ordinances are brought into conformance with the general plan, as soon as practical after the general plan is adopted." Further, adoption of this Development Code is consistent with numerous other general plan policies and programs which reference its adoption as a means of implementing the general plan. 
C.  In accordance with California Government Code Section 65855, which requires that zone text amendments shall also be consistent with any applicable specific plan, the adoption of this Development Code is consistent with the Village Specific Plan adopted by Ordinance No. 87-142 because the zoning map adopted in conjunction with this Development Code indicates the area that is governed by the Village Specific Plan. Further, this Development Code contains specific standards to supplement the Village Specific Plan in order to encourage pedestrian-oriented commercial uses in the village area, such as standards for outdoor dining and temporary display of merchandise. 
D.  Any interpretation of this Development Code shall be made in conformance with the general plan. In no case shall this Development Code be interpreted to allow a use, or development type or intensity, which is not in conformance with the general plan. 
E.  No land shall be developed nor shall any use be approved or initiated or permit approved which is not in conformance with the general plan, applicable specific plan, this Development Code, or other applicable provisions of the Big Bear Lake Municipal Code. 
F.  No land shall be developed nor shall any use be approved or initiated or permit approved which is not in conformance with all applicable federal, state, or county adopted plans, regulations, or programs, including, but not limited to, National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and San Bernardino County Hazardous Waste Management Plan. 
(Ord. 2003-333 § 4 (Exh. A (part), 2003))  
17.01.040 - Applicability and scope. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of this Development Code shall apply to all real property located within the incorporated boundaries of the city of Big Bear Lake, including land and improvements. 
B.  This Development Code is intended to be implemented in conjunction with other applicable codes and ordinances of the city of Big Bear Lake, including but not limited to building and fire codes, engineering design standards, and development-related ordinances. Where such other codes and ordinances are less specific or restrictive than the language of this Development Code, the provisions of this Development Code shall govern; but when such other codes and ordinances are more specific or restrictive than the language of this Development Code, the more specific or restrictive language shall govern. 
C.  This Development Code shall not apply to any land and/or improvements located within the incorporated boundaries of the city of Big Bear Lake which are owned by other governmental entities having authority for environmental review and land use approval and for which state or federal regulations pre-empt local zoning ordinances. 
D.  Whenever reference is made to any portion of this Development Code, or of any other law or ordinance, the reference applies to all amendments and additions, now or hereafter made, to this Development Code and to such laws and ordinances. 
E.  The provisions of this Development Code shall not be construed to limit or interfere with the installation, maintenance, and operation of public utility pipelines and transmission lines, when located within a public right-of-way or easement and permitted by easement or franchise. 
F.  Existing Permits and Approvals. 
1.  Any building for which a valid building permit was issued under the provisions of earlier ordinances of the city which are in conflict with this Development Code, before the effective date of this title, may be continued and completed in accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the permit was issued, provided that such permit is valid at the time of commencement of construction and that substantial work has been completed and substantial liabilities have been incurred in good faith reliance upon said building permit. 
2.  Subdivision of property pursuant to a tentative tract map or tentative parcel map which has been approved pursuant to the provisions of earlier ordinances of the city prior to the effective date of this Development Code, and which is in conflict with this title, may be continued and completed in accordance with the provisions of approval provided it is completed within the time limit in effect at the time of its approval, and provided that it complies with all other ordinances and laws in effect at the time the application was deemed complete. Final tract maps and final parcel maps may be approved pursuant to this section, provided that building permits and other permits issued for any lots created pursuant to this paragraph, shall be consistent with the applicable provisions of this Development Code.

4.  Nothing in this Development Code shall be interpreted to supersede the provisions of a development agreement which was adopted prior to the effective date of the Development Code, and which is still in effect on that date. However, in any instance where such development agreement is silent on standards, requirements or other provisions which are contained in this Development Code, and such provisions are not in conflict with the development agreement, the Development Code shall govern. 
G.  Pending Applications. After the effective date of this Development Code, any pending land use application that was not deemed complete as of that date shall be subject to the applicable provisions of the Development Code, except for subdivisions. Any pending subdivision application which has been deemed complete as of the effective date of this Development Code shall be subject to the provisions of the Development Code and other ordinances which were in effect on the date such application was deemed complete; except that in cases where the applicant informs the city, in writing, that the applicant wishes the application to be reviewed pursuant to this Development Code, then the provisions contained herein shall apply. 
H.  Previous Violations. Any use, building, or improvement which was determined to be a violation of city codes, ordinances or requirements prior to the effective date of this Development Code, shall be deemed to be a continuing violation.

If the final written determination on the appeal is not made within that sixty (60) day period, the application with the submitted materials shall be deemed complete. The planning commission shall be the final reviewing authority on an appeal of a determination of application incompleteness. 
C.  The city planner or his/her designee, or the planning commission, and the applicant may mutually agree to an extension of these time limits, as permitted by state law. 
D.  After a final determination that an application is incomplete, the city shall return the application materials to the applicant and shall refund any unexpended portion of the application fee, pursuant to the city's fee resolution.

17.03.070 - Time limits for rendering land use decisions. 
The following time limits are established for rendering land use decisions, unless otherwise required or authorized by applicable law. 
A.  Except for legislative acts of the city council, the city shall render its decision on a land use application within the following time limits unless otherwise required or authorized by applicable law: 
1.  If a negative declaration is prepared, or if the project is exempt pursuant to the Public Resources Code, the project shall be approved or disapproved within the time limits set forth by California Government Code Section 65950, as amended from time to time except as provided in Section 17.03.070.A.3. 
2.  If an environmental impact report (EIR) is prepared, the project shall be approved or disapproved within the time limits set forth by California Government Code Section 65950, as amended from time to time, except as provided in Section 17.03.070.A.3. 
3.  Should compelling circumstances justify additional time to complete the environmental review process, no more than one extension of time may be granted by the planning division, if the project applicant requests or consents to such an extension, for a period not to exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the extension, subject to the applicable provisions of state law and the city's adopted CEQA Guidelines. No other extension, continuance, or waiver of these time limits either by the project applicant or the city shall be permitted, pursuant to state law. 
4.  The planning commission shall approve, conditionally approve, extend, or disapprove a tentative map within the legal time limits established by the Subdivision Map Act. These time limits or any other time limits for reporting and acting on maps as specified in Title 16 (Subdivisions) of the Municipal Code or any other applicable adopted ordinance, policy or code, may be extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the planning division. Upon consent of the subdivider, a waiver of any of these time limits may be obtained for the purpose of permitting concurrent processing of related land use applications. Pursuant to California Government Code Section 66452.1(c), the time limits for action on a tentative map commence after the certification of an EIR, adoption of a negative declaration, or a determination that the project is exempt from CEQA review. 
B.  When a land use application decision is contingent on approval of another application which requires legislative action, such as a general plan amendment or zone change, the time limits specified by this section for acting on such a land use application shall commence on the effective date of the last such legislative action on which that land use application is contingent.

(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.03.080 - Decisions by reviewing authority. 
A.  A reviewing authority may refer a request for a land use decision to the reviewing authority designated as the appeal body for that type of land use application. In such cases, the referring authority shall prepare a statement containing the reasons for referring the land use decisions. 
B.  Prior to rendering a land use decision, the reviewing authority shall address each of the required findings or criteria that apply to the application type as described in this chapter. Evidence or testimony shall be given to substantiate the reviewing authority's determination on each of the findings applicable to the case being considered, and shall be specifically cited in the action taken by the reviewing authority. 
C.  From time to time, hearings on development applications may be continued, provided that the time and place to which continued is announced prior to adjournment of the meeting from which continued. Where such continuances are requested by the applicant, the city may require payment of fees as specified by city council resolution, to reimburse costs reasonably borne for such continuance of the public hearing. 
D.  The reviewing authority may take an action of denial without prejudice on a land use application. Such action shall allow the applicant to reapply for the same permit immediately upon the effective date of the decision unless otherwise specified in the Development Code. 
E.  In approving an application for a land use decision, the reviewing authority may establish reasonable conditions to its approval that are found to be necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
F.  The reviewing authority shall ensure that each application approval is consistent with the San Bernardino County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, and shall add conditions of approval as deemed necessary to ensure compliance with said plan. 
G.  For legislative actions such as general and specific plan amendments, zone changes, and development-related ordinances, the planning commission shall review and make a recommendation to the city council as the final reviewing authority. 
H.  The planning commission shall adopt and publish rules for the conduct of their hearings or meetings on zoning matters. 
I.  When a city staff report exists concerning a zoning matter, such report shall, if possible, be made available to the public prior to any subsequent public hearing on the matter and shall be presented and made a part of the public record at the beginning of such hearing. 
J.  When a zoning matter is contested and a prior written request is made to the body conducting a hearing on the matter, a record of the hearing shall be made, and copies made available to any interested party at cost. A deposit may be required with such request.

17.03.090 - Effective date of land use decisions. 
A.  Ordinances approving land use decisions shall become effective thirty (30) days after the second reading of the ordinance, unless some later date is specified within the ordinance. 
B.  Land use decisions made at a public hearing shall be effective on the eleventh day after the decision date, except when the eleventh such day is not a city business day. In such circumstances, the land use decision shall become effective on the next city business day following such eleventh day. 
C.  Land use decisions made by administrative action shall become effective on the eleventh day after the written notice of the land use decision has been deposited in the U.S. mail, except when the eleventh such day is not a city business day. In such instances, the land use decision shall become effective on the next city business day following such eleventh day. 
D.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, land use decisions which are made contingent upon approval of a legislative action, such as a general plan amendment or zone change, shall become effective on the date when the approval of the last such application to which they are subject becomes effective.

17.03.100 - Modifications to land use approvals. 
A.  Minor modifications to the approved site plan or the conditions of approval for a development project may be approved by the city planner through an application for a minor modification, pursuant to Section 17.03.250 of this Development Code. However, should the city planner determine that the proposed modification(s) may have significant impacts on the project site or surrounding properties, the city planner may require submittal of an application and approval of a major modification to the original project approval. In the latter case, the review procedures for the requested modification(s) shall be those that were applicable to the project when originally reviewed. 
(Ord. 2003-333 § 4 (Exh. A (part), 2003)) 
(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.03.110 - Appeal procedures. 
A.  Prior to its effective date, any land use decision made in accordance with the provisions of this Development Code by a reviewing authority other than the city council, may be appealed by the applicant, a member of the city council, or any other person as follows: 
1.  The planning commission shall consider appeals regarding land use decisions made by the city planner. 
2.  The city council shall consider appeals regarding land use decisions made by the planning commission. 
3.  Appeals of any actions of the city planner or planning commission, as outlined above, may be made by any person in the manner described below. While an appeal is pending, the establishment of any affected structure or use is to be held in abeyance. 
B.  Applications for an appeal of a land use decision, including an appeal filed by a member of the city council, shall be made upon forms supplied by the reviewing authority to which the appeal is being made. All such applications for appeals shall be submitted to the planning division and shall be accompanied by a written statement of the grounds upon which the appeal is based. A uniform fee, as established by the city council, shall be paid at the time the appeal is filed. 
C.  An appeal of a land use decision must be filed prior to the date on which such land use decision becomes effective, as specified in Section 17.03.090 of this chapter. Within thirty (30) days of the acceptance of an application for an appeal of a land use decision (except where otherwise provided in the Subdivision Map Act), the city planner or city clerk shall establish a hearing date and shall give notice of the date, time and place of the hearing to the appellant, the applicant, and to any other party who has requested in writing to be so notified. In addition, notice shall also be given in the same manner as notice was given for the land use decision being appealed. 
D.  Any member of the city council who appeals a land use decision made in accordance with the provisions of this Development Code to the city council shall abstain from participating as a member of the city council in the appeal hearing and decision, but may provide written or oral testimony on the matter to the city council in the same manner as, and in the time provided for, members of the general public. 
E.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 17.03.110.D regarding appeal procedures for any city council member, the city council may vote at a duly noticed public meeting to review a decision by the planning commission, within ten (10) calendar days of such decision. The application decision requested for city council review shall be agendized at the next regularly scheduled meeting, and shall not be subject to payment of a fee. 
F.  Upon hearing the appeal, the appeal body shall consider the record and such additional evidence as may be offered, and may affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, the order, requirements, decision, determination, interpretation or ruling being appealed, or may make or substitute such other or additional decision or determination as it may find warranted under the provisions of the Development Code, or other applicable adopted city code, resolution or standards. The appeal body is subject to all of the criteria and findings requirements imposed upon the original decision maker, including the requirements for environmental review. The appropriate authority shall forthwith transmit a copy of the decision to the applicant, appellant and, in the case of a city council decision, to the planning commission. 
(Ord. 2003-333 § 4 (Exh. A (part), 2003)) 
(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.03.120 - Approval period for conditional land use decisions. 
A.  Any conditional land use decision made in accordance with the provisions of this Development Code shall be subject to the following time limitations: 
1.  Unless all conditions have been complied with and the occupancy, use or division of land authorized by the land use decision has been inaugurated or been recorded within the time specified for each land use application type within this Development Code, the land use decision shall become null and void. For the purposes of this section, the term "inaugurated" shall mean that applicable grading and building permits have been issued, and that substantial work has been performed and substantial liabilities have been incurred in good faith reliance on such permits. 
2.  Where circumstances warrant, the reviewing authority may grant an extension of time. The length of such extension shall be determined by the reviewing authority based on the limitation specified in this chapter, but in no case shall a conditional land use decision be extended for a total approval period exceeding three years unless otherwise provided by state law. The reviewing authority of an application for an extension of time of a previously approved development project shall be the authority which reviewed the original application, except where such application was approved on appeal, in which case the reviewing authority shall be the appeal body. All requests for a time extension shall be submitted in complete form within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date and must be deemed complete by the city by the expiration date in accordance with Sections 17.03.050 and 17.03.060, or the project approval will be deemed to have expired. 
3.  Public projects shall not be subject to a time limitation unless specific time limits are included within conditions placed upon the project's approval. When time limits are placed within the conditional approval of a public project, extensions of time may be granted whenever warranted, provided no single action is taken to grant an extension greater than twenty-four (24) months.

17.03.130 - Pre-construction conference. 
A.  The city may request that a project applicant or developer attend a pre-construction conference prior to the issuance of grading and/or construction permits for a conditionally approved development project. The purpose of this conference is to acquaint the developer with the requirements, policies and procedures of the city, to identify special conditions of approval and/or mitigation measures which must be addressed at the construction stage, and to familiarize the city with anticipated construction schedules and personnel. 
B.  The applicant may be required to submit materials at the time of application to facilitate review of construction related issues on the project.

(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.03.140 - Final clearance. 
A.  No building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied, and no change in the existing occupancy classification or existing use of a building, structure, or land, or portion thereof, shall be made unless zoning clearance is first obtained from the planning division, in addition to other required approvals, inspections, and certificates. 
B.  New buildings, building expansions and building alterations. Final clearance from the planning division shall be granted only after such new buildings, enlargement, or alteration have been completed in conformity with the provisions of the Development Code and with any approved site development plans and required conditions, and when the proposed use conforms to the Development Code and any other applicable adopted city ordinances, resolutions, ordinances, or standards. 
C.  Existing buildings and undeveloped land. Except as provided in Section 17.03.320 (Non-Conforming Uses and Structures), final clearance from the planning division shall be granted for the re-use of an existing building or the use of undeveloped land only after the improvements for such building or land conform to the property development standards of the Development Code and other applicable city codes, resolutions, ordinances, or standards. Such standards may include the provision of required walls, landscaping, parking, trash enclosures, street improvements, and all other improvements determined by the reviewing authority to be necessary or required by any regulating authority for the particular use.

17.03.150 - Preliminary development review. 
A.  An applicant may submit materials for and attend a preliminary development review conference to evaluate the development proposal prior to acceptance of a formal application. The purpose of this conference is to acquaint the city and other agencies with the intentions of the applicant, to acquaint the applicant with any applicable policies and procedures, to identify city ordinance and improvement standards applicable to the proposal, and to identify any significant development opportunities and/or constraints on the site. 
B.  The preliminary development review shall include an exchange of information concerning the entire area intended by the applicant to be developed, even if such development is intended to proceed by stages, whether or not applications for review of the entire project area are made at the time of the initial application. 
C.  Application for pre-development review shall be made at the planning division and shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee as adopted by the city council or other agencies. The applicant shall submit development plans and or other applicable materials, showing proposed land use types, areas and locations. The conceptual development plan and/or materials shall include sufficient information about the proposal to permit evaluation of the development issues identified in this section. The application shall include an affidavit signed by the applicant indicating their understanding that the preliminary development review is not an application for a "development project" as defined in California Government Code Section 65920 et seq., and that the time limits of the Permit Streamlining Act are not applicable. 
D.  The preliminary development review shall address, but not be limited to, the following subject matter, as applicable. 
1.  Subject Parcel: its size, location, dimensions and area; any existing improvements or development on site; existing general plan and zoning designations. 
2.  Proposed Development Project: uses proposed for the site, type and placement of buildings and other improvements. 
3.  Characteristics of the Project Site and Vicinity: existing and proposed land use designations and development on adjacent parcels; any identified natural or manmade hazards on site or in the vicinity. 
4.  Proposed Circulation Improvements, Both On and Off-Site: access points and vehicular access ways, parking, loading, and pedestrian circulation, location and width of existing and proposed improvements on adjacent roadways. 
5.  Public Improvements: type, location and sizes of public facilities likely to be required to support the proposal, including utilities, sewer, water and drainage, along with a plan for providing and maintaining improvements. 
6.  Open Space: location, amount, type and method of maintenance for proposed open space and landscaped areas. 
7.  Community Service Impacts: estimated impacts on public services, including schools, parks, fire and police protection, and solid waste disposal.

(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.03.160 - Plot plan review. 
The plot plan review process is intended to promote orderly and attractive development, recognize environmental limitations on development, stabilize land values and investments, and promote the general welfare by preventing the establishment of uses or erection of structures having qualities which would not meet the specific intent clauses or performance standards of the general plan or of this Development Code or which are not properly related to their sites, surroundings, traffic circulation, or environmental setting. 
A.  General Provisions. 
1.  No person shall undertake, conduct or use, or cause to be undertaken, conducted or used, any development project(s) which requires a plot plan review, without having first complied with the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  Where the use proposed, the adjacent land uses, environmental significance or limitations, topography, or traffic circulation is found to so require, the reviewing authority may establish more stringent regulations than those otherwise specified for the applicable zone district in which the project site is located. 
3.  The following uses have been determined to be exempt from plot plan review requirements: 
a.  Interior remodels which do not result in substantial changes in the character of the occupancy or use, or cause greater impact on traffic or waste disposal, as determined by the building official and city planner. For purposes of this section, the term "substantial changes" shall mean a change which requires a different occupancy classification under the applicable fire and building codes, or which alters the use of the building from one general use category to another (such as a change from residential to commercial, or a change from office to retail use). The term "greater impact" shall mean a significant increase in the number of vehicle trips generated by the use, or in the amount or type of solid waste generated by the use. 
b.  Alterations to building exteriors not resulting in substantial changes of use, drainage patterns, parking, traffic, easements, or greater impacts on infrastructure and public services, as determined by the city planner. For purposes of this section, the term "substantial changes" shall mean a change in use type or use classification as set forth in paragraph 17.03.160.A.3.a, or a change which results in changed or increased stormwater runoff, increased parking requirements, increased trip generation, the need for dedication of easements, greater incompatibility with surrounding properties and uses, and/or increased demand for public services. 
c.  Repair and maintenance of structures or parking areas, unless constrained by existing infrastructure and existing drainage patterns and/or easements. For purposes of this section, the term "constrained by existing infrastructure" shall mean that any proposed maintenance and/or repair will not alter the site so as to change drainage flows, obstruct easements, or conflict with existing utilities or rights-of-way. 
d.  Replacement and/or repair of a structure partially destroyed by fire, flood or other natural occurrence, when the repair of such structure is determined by the building official and city planner to be consistent with the design, use and intensity of the original structure, and consistent with the zoning and general plan designations. For purposes of this section, the term "partially destroyed" shall mean that the cost to repair the structure shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the value of the structure. 
e.  Expansions to multiple residential, commercial or industrial buildings or structures of twenty-five percent (25%) or less of the total floor area, or no more than five hundred (500) square feet, whichever is less, where the proposed expansion will not result in a change in the land use or intensity, or cause increased impacts on existing infrastructure and public services, as determined by the city planner. A new plot plan review or major modification shall be required where an addition, which combined with any addition approved within twenty-four (24) months of the filing of the application, exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the total floor area or five hundred (500) square feet, whichever is less. 
f.  Reductions of floor or building area within a previously approved plot plan review where it is determined that the modification would not result in a significant change in circumstances requiring additional environmental or planning review. 
g.  Single-family residential development (one residence per parcel) on existing lots of record. 
4.  Where permitted by the zone and unless otherwise specified, the following uses shall require approval of a plot plan review. 
a.  Any use that is listed as permitted with plot plan review in the applicable zone district. 
b.  Any new construction of a commercial, industrial, multiple family residential, or institutional use (including public and quasi-public facilities), except as otherwise specified in this Development Code. 
c.  Additions to pre-existing multiple residential, commercial or industrial structures or uses which have been legally established under the provisions of an approved plot plan review and which are permitted as such in the applicable zone district, which will result in an increase in total floor area of twenty-five (25) percent or greater, or expansions of five hundred (500) square feet or greater. 
d.  Projects involving a change or intensification of land use, when the new use is permitted in the underlying zone district with plot plan review. 
e.  A conversion of a single-family house to any other use, except as otherwise specified in this Development Code. 
5.  All applications for plot plan review or a major modification of a plot plan review shall be reviewed by the planning commission. 
6.  Any use existing on the effective date of this Development Code, which was permitted subject to an approved plot plan review, shall be deemed a pre-existing use. Such use may continue in accordance with this section, provided that the use is operated and maintained in compliance with the conditions prescribed at the time of its establishment, if any. Any expansion, alteration, or reconstruction of a site or building containing a previously approved plot plan review use which has become non-conforming due to adoption of this Development Code or any subsequent amendments thereto, shall comply with Section 17.03.320 of this chapter regulating non-conforming uses until such use is brought into conformance with this Development Code. Any use existing on the effective date of this Development Code which would require approval of a plot plan review to be established in that zone, but for which such approval has not been obtained, shall be deemed a non-conforming use and regulated by Section 17.03.320 of this Development Code, except that the owner may file an application for a plot plan review to legalize the use along with any proposed expansions, alterations or reconstructions which comply with the requirements of this Development Code. Approval of any such application would eliminate the classification of the property as "non-conforming." 
B.  Application Procedure. 
1.  Preliminary Development Review. A conference between city staff, any referral agencies deemed necessary by the city, and the applicant may be conducted pursuant to Section 17.03.150. 
2.  Formal Application Submittal.

17.03.170 - Conditional use permits. 
A.  The purpose of a conditional use permit is to allow certain uses that contribute to the orderly growth and development of the city to be properly integrated into the surroundings in which they are to be located. The conditional use permit process is intended to provide an opportunity for public review and evaluation of site-specific requirements and characteristics, to provide adequate mitigation of any potentially adverse impacts, and to ensure that all site development regulations and performance standards are provided in accordance with the Development Code. In addition, the conditional use permit ensures ongoing compliance with conditions of operation, which may be applied to the use in order to protect public health, safety and welfare, and to ensure compliance with the general plan goals, objectives and policies. 
B.  General Provisions. 
1.  No person shall undertake, conduct or use, or cause to be undertaken, conducted or used, any development projects that require a conditional use permit, without having first complied with the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  In granting any conditional use permit, the reviewing authority shall affix those conditions, which it deems necessary in order to safeguard the public health, safety and general welfare of the district and to ensure compliance with the general plan. Where the use proposed, the adjacent land uses, environmental significance or limitations, topography, or traffic circulation is found to so require, the reviewing authority may establish more stringent regulations than those otherwise specified for the zone district in which the project is located. The city may require dedication of land or easements for public use, provided that there is a reasonable relationship between the required dedication and the impact of the proposed development, and that the required dedication is related both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development. 
3.  Any use existing on the effective date of this Development Code, which was permitted subject to an approved conditional use permit, shall be deemed a pre-existing conditional use. Such use may continue in accordance with this Development Code, provided that the use is operated and maintained in compliance with the conditions prescribed at the time of its establishment, if any. Any expansion, alteration, or reconstruction of the use or building containing a previously approved conditional use which has become non-conforming due to adoption of this Development Code or any subsequent amendments thereto shall comply with Section 17.03.320 of this chapter regulating non-conforming uses, until such use is brought into conformance with the Development Code. Any use existing on the effective date of this Development Code which would require approval of a conditional use permit to be established in that zone, but for which such approval has not been obtained, shall be deemed a non-conforming use and regulated by Section 17.03.320 of this Development Code, except that the owner may file an application for a conditional use permit to legalize the use along with any proposed expansions, alterations or reconstructions which comply with the requirements of this Development Code. Approval of any such application would eliminate the classification of the property as "non-conforming." 
4.  The planning commission shall review requests for conditional use permits at a public hearing, pursuant to Section 17.03.030 of this chapter. 
5.  Uses listed as "uses permitted subject to approval of a conditional use permit" may be permitted in the applicable zone districts pursuant to the provisions of this article. 
C.  Application Procedure. 
1.  Preliminary Development Review. A conference between city staff, any referral agencies deemed necessary by the city, and the applicant may be conducted pursuant to Section 17.03.150. 
2.  Formal Application Submittal.

4.  Drawings and Elevations. 
a.  Elevations showing the general appearance and features of proposed structures shall be submitted, as required on the application checklist. 
b.  When required by the planning division, drawings and elevations shall be submitted in addition to those accompanying the plot plan, which shall include but not be limited to the following:

D.  Approval Requirements. 
1.  Conditional use permit approval shall apply only to the property for which the application was made, and shall apply to that property as long as the use for which approval was granted is in effect, regardless of changes in ownership. 
2.  The uses authorized by the conditional use permit shall be commenced within the period of time specified by the planning commission, not to exceed twenty-four (24) months from the effective date of the decision, except as otherwise specified in the conditional use permit. One or more extensions of time, not to exceed a total of twelve (12) months from the original expiration date, may be granted pursuant to Section 17.03.120 of this Development Code, except as otherwise specified in the conditional use permit. 
3.  The following requirements may be placed upon the development project by the reviewing authority as conditions of approval: 
a.  Dedications and/or easements for streets, alleys, drainage, public utilities, recreational trails, flood control, and such other rights-of-way as may be determined essential to the orderly development of the site and abutting properties, provided that there is a reasonable relationship between the required dedication and the impact of the proposed development, and that the required dedication is related both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development.

4.  The proposed project and the on-going operation of the use will not have a substantial adverse effect on abutting property or the permitted use thereof, and will not generate excessive noise, vibration, traffic, or other disturbances, nuisances, or hazards; and 
5.  The site for the proposed project has adequate access, meaning that the site design incorporates street and highway limitations. 
F.  Revisions and Modifications. 
1.  Revisions or modifications of an approved conditional use permit may be requested by the applicant in accordance with the procedures and criteria specified below. Further, the planning commission may periodically review, modify or revoke a conditional use permit as specified herein, if it determines that the use is not being conducted in accordance with the project approval, or that the use is being conducted in such a manner that it has become detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare. 
2.  Revisions/Modifications by Applicant. 
a.  Minor Revisions. A revision or modification to an approved conditional use permit such as, but not limited to, minor changes in the site design, parking or building placement, which will not increase or change the use or intensity of the site or impact fire and life safety, may be acted on by the city planner upon submittal of an application, required materials, and applicable fees for minor modification, pursuant to Section 17.03.250. 
b.  Major Revisions. A major revision or modification to an approved conditional use permit such as, but not limited to, change in conditions, expansions, intensification, location, hours of operation, or any change which may have the potential to impact fire and life safety, may be requested by the applicant. Such request shall be processed through application of a major modification or new conditional use permit, as determined by the city planner. 
3.  Review by Planning Commission. The planning commission may periodically review any conditional use permit to ensure that it is being operated in a manner consistent with conditions of approval or in a manner, which is not detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties in the vicinity. If, after review, the planning commission deems that there is sufficient evidence to warrant a full examination, then a public hearing date shall be set. 
G.  Modification or Revocation. 
1.  Any conditional use permit granted pursuant to this section, or granted under any of the development codes of the city and still in effect, including any which may have been granted automatically for a nonconforming prior use, shall be revoked upon a finding that one or more of the following conditions exist: 
a.  That the use is detrimental to the public health or safety or is a nuisance; 
b.  That the permit or approval was obtained by fraud; 
c.  That the use for which the permit or approval was granted has ceased, or has been suspended for one year or more; 
d.  That the applicant has not complied with one or more of the conditions of approval or the permit or approval requirements. 
2.  Any such finding shall be by the planning commission, after public hearing of which the initial applicant (or any successor of record whose address has been furnished) shall be given ten (10) days of advance written notice by first class mail directed to the applicant's address of record (or such successor's address so furnished) as per the files of the planning division. Said notice shall contain a notification of the reasons that the revocation is being considered. The finding of the planning commission and the determination pursuant thereto, shall be subject to appeal pursuant to Section 17.03.110. Action of the planning commission or the city council on appeal shall be by resolution, and shall contain specific findings and specific action relative to the revocation. 
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions set forth above, the planning commission, or the city council on appeal, may grant a period of time within which the use may be reactivated, or within which noncompliance with conditions may be remedied. In such event, the resolution shall be considered temporary, and the hearing shall be continued automatically, without further notice, to the first regular meeting of the body adopting the resolution following such extended date or dates set for full compliance. Thereupon by further resolution, the body theretofore otherwise finally acting shall take final action with respect thereto. No further appeal from any action of the planning commission shall be permitted, and such action of the planning commission or city council shall be final and conclusive. 
4.  New applications following denial or revocation.

(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.03.180 - Variances and minor deviations. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of a variance or minor deviation shall be to ensure that no property, because of special circumstances specifically related to its size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, shall be deprived of privileges commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same vicinity and zone district. 
B.  General Provisions. 
1.  In no case shall a variance or minor deviation be granted to permit a use other than a use permitted or conditionally permitted in the zone district applicable to the property. 
2.  Any variance or minor deviation granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and district in which such property is situated. 
C.  Reviewing Authority. 
1.  The reviewing authority may grant a minor deviation or variance from any property development standard (including setbacks and heights) in the city's adopted Development Code, subject to the procedures set forth in this section. 
2.  Review and approval for the following minor deviation requests will be through administrative review, pursuant to the following provisions and based upon the findings contained in Section 17.03.180.G.3, except that if a development project proposed concurrently with such minor deviation will be reviewed by the planning commission or city council, the reviewing authority for the project may approve the minor deviation in conjunction with the project approval. 
a.  Fence Height. Excepting within any front yard setback area, the maximum height of any fence, wall, hedge, or equivalent screening may be increased by a maximum of twenty percent (20%), where topography or a difference in grade between abutting sites warrants such increase in height to maintain a level of privacy, or to maintain effectiveness of screening, or to provide additional security when warranted, provided that the increased height does not encroach into the vehicle sight distance or otherwise impede visibility of motorists. 
b.  Setbacks. The required setback may be decreased by not more than fifteen percent (15%) where the proposed setback area or yard is in character with the surrounding neighborhood and is not required as an essential open space or recreational amenity to the use of the site, and where such decrease will not unreasonably affect abutting sites. 
c.  Off-site Parking. A maximum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required parking for a use may be located off-site. Said parking shall not be located more than three hundred (300) feet walking distance from the building entrance on the site of the use which such parking will serve, provided that the city planner determines that the use will be served as effectively, safely, and conveniently as it would be served if parking was located on the site for which it is required. The reviewing authority shall require an agreement to ensure on-going availability and maintenance of off-site parking facilities. 
d.  On-site Parking. A maximum of fifteen percent (15%) reduction in the required on-site parking spaces may be granted provided that a suitable area exists on the site on which to provide the additional required spaces if needed, and based upon a finding that the reduction will not result in an adverse impact on parking availability or traffic congestion. 
e.  Minor Reconfiguration of Existing Parking. The reviewing authority may authorize minor reconfiguration of an existing parking lot in order to comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Such reconfiguration may include a maximum fifteen percent (15%) reduction of the applicable on-site parking requirements when it is demonstrated that the reduction will not result in an adverse impact on parking availability or traffic congestion. 
f.  Loading Facilities. A maximum reduction in the number of loading spaces of one space may be granted by the reviewing authority, based upon a finding supported by evidence that such space will not be needed by the use. 
g.  On-site Landscaping. The reviewing authority may authorize a fifteen percent (15%) decrease in the required on-site landscaping requirement, where it can be demonstrated that such reduction is necessary in order to provide for necessary public transportation and transit improvements, such as bus turnouts and turning lanes; where site constraints preclude the relocation of such landscaping to another location; and where the overall appearance of the site will not be adversely affected. 
h.  Landscape Setback Area. The reviewing authority may allow averaging of the required landscape setback area adjacent to streets, provided the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The required on-site landscaping requirement is fully met on the site. 
(2)  No more than thirty percent (30%) of the landscape setback area along the site frontage shall be allowed to be reduced in width. 
(3)  In no case shall the landscaped setback area be less than ten (10) feet. 
(4)  The overall landscape design shall not be adversely affected. 
i.  Other deviations from development standards determined by the city planner to be minor in nature, provided that such deviation does not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of any required specification and no adverse effects will result from the deviation. 
3.  In calculating percentages specified in this section, rounding up of fractions shall not be permitted. 
4.  Any request to deviate from development standards required by this Development Code which is not listed in Section 17.03.180.C.2 shall be deemed a variance and shall be reviewed by the planning commission at a public hearing. 
5.  The planning commission is authorized to grant variances in accordance with the procedures in this section, with respect to development standards which include but are not limited to the following: 
a.  Fences, walls, and screening. 
b.  Site area, width and depth. 
c.  Front, rear and side yards. 
d.  Lot coverage. 
e.  Height of structures. 
f.  Landscaped areas and planters. 
g.  Performance standards. 
h.  Loading areas and facilities, provided that any reduction in the number of loading spaces is supported by evidence demonstrating that the space will not be needed by the use. 
i.  Sign height, number and location. 
j.  Parking spaces and parking lot configuration. 
k.  Driveway width and location. 
D.  Application Procedures. 
1.  An application for a minor deviation or variance shall be filed with the planning division, along with the required fee. The signed application shall be made by the property owner or his authorized agent. 
2.  An application for a minor deviation or variance shall be accompanied by all required materials and a site plan showing the subject property as well as the surrounding area. Plans of the subject property shall show all existing and proposed buildings and uses, and any other data required by the planning division to adequately review the application. 
E.  Notice Requirements. 
1.  Minor Deviation. Prior to rendering a decision, the city planner shall provide written notice to contiguous property owners of the requested minor deviation. Such notice shall contain a description of the type and location of the requested minor deviation and the anticipated decision date, and shall allow ten (10) days to submit comments to the city. Upon the passage of ten (10) days, the city planner may render a decision. 
2.  Variance. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on each application for a variance. The hearing shall be set and notice given as prescribed in Section 17.03.030. 
F.  Approval Requirements. The following requirements may be placed upon a minor deviation or variance by the reviewing authority as conditions of approval. All such conditions shall be binding upon the applicants and their successors. 
1.  Requirements for special yards, open spaces, buffers, fences, walls, and screening. 
2.  Requirements for installation and maintenance of landscaping and erosion control measures, and for preservation of existing trees. 
3.  Requirements for access improvements and dedications, regulation of vehicular ingress and egress, and traffic circulation, provided that there is a reasonable relationship between the required dedication and the impact of the proposed development, and that the required dedication is related both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development. 
4.  Requirements for maintenance of landscaping and other improvements. 
5.  Establishment of development schedules or time limits for performance, completion, or removal. 
6.  Requirements for periodic review by the reviewing authority. 
7.  Any other such conditions as the reviewing authority may deem reasonably necessary to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses, to preserve the public health, safety and welfare, and to enable the reviewing authority to make the findings required by Section 17.03.180.G.3 of this chapter. 
G.  Determination by the Approval Authority. 
1.  Minor Deviation. In evaluating a request for a minor deviation, the city planner shall determine that the request satisfies all of the required findings contained in paragraph G.3 of this section, and that the request is consistent with the general plan and all applicable codes and ordinances. 
2.  Variance. The planning commission will determine the merits of any proposed variance, and its compliance with the principles, standards, policies, and goals of the general plan and the Development Code. Approval of any variance shall be based upon all of the findings to be made by the approval authority in approving or denying a variance as contained in paragraph G.3 of this section, and a determination that the request is consistent with the general plan and all applicable codes and ordinances. 
3.  Findings for Approval of a Minor Deviation or Variance: 
a.  There are special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, so that the strict application of this Development Code would deprive such property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under identical land use district classification; 
b.  Granting the minor deviation or variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same vicinity and land use district and denied to the property for which the variance is sought; 
c.  Granting the minor deviation or variance will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or injurious to the properties or improvements in such vicinity and land use district in which the property is located; and 
d.  Granting the minor deviation or variance does not constitute a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and land use district in which such property is located. 
H.  New Application Following Denial. Following the denial of a minor deviation or variance application, no application for the same or substantially the same application on the same or substantially the same site shall be filed within one year of the date of denial. 
I.  Appeal Procedure. 
1.  Prior to its effective date, any decision made on a minor deviation request by the city planner may be appealed to the planning commission, pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.03.110. 
2.  Prior to its effective date, any decision made on a variance request by the planning commission may be appealed to the city council, pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.03.110. 
J.  Voiding of Variances or Minor Deviations. 
1.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, any variance or minor deviation granted under the provisions of this Code shall become null and void unless: 
a.  The construction authorized by said variance or minor deviation has been inaugurated within twelve (12) months of the effective date of said variance or minor deviation, and pursued diligently to completion; or 
b.  The occupancy of land or buildings authorized by such variance or minor deviation has taken place within twelve (12) months of the effective date of such variance or minor exception. 
2.  Where a minor deviation or variance request is granted concurrently with one or more other entitlements, the minor deviation or variance shall be in effect for the time period allotted under the other land use entitlements. 
3.  Where circumstances beyond the control of the applicant cause delays which do not permit compliance with the time limits established herein, the reviewing authority may grant an extension of time for a period not to exceed twelve (12) additional months except as provided herein. Where a minor deviation or variance request is granted concurrently with one or more entitlements, an extension of the variance may be considered by the reviewing authority concurrently with the time extension requests for the other entitlements; however, in no event shall a variance or minor deviation be extended beyond the expiration date of any other land use entitlement on the project site. 
4.  The reviewing authority may void any variance or minor deviation for non-compliance with the conditions set forth in approving the variance or minor deviation. If the city planner determines that a variance or minor deviation is not in compliance with the conditions set forth in approving the variance or minor deviation, the city planner shall provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing to the approval holder before making a decision to revoke or not revoke the approval. After setting a date for a public hearing, the city planner shall notify the applicant and owners of the variance or minor deviation approval in question. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail and shall state that the planning commission will be reviewing the variance or minor deviation for possible modification or revocation. The notice of public hearing shall also state the date, time and place of hearing, and shall comply with Section 17.03.030 of this chapter. If the planning commission determines, after reviewing the information and considering the information presented during the hearing, that sufficient evidence exists of a violation, the planning commission may revoke the variance or minor deviation or impose additional conditions to ensure compliance. The variance or minor deviation holder may appeal the decision by filing an appeal as allowed and specified in Section 17.03.110.

B.  General Provisions. 
1.  A change in the boundaries of any zone may be initiated by the owner or the authorized agent of the owner of property, by filing an application for a zone change as prescribed in this section. If the property for which rezoning is proposed is in more than one ownership, all the owners or their authorized agents must join in filing the application. If deemed appropriate by the city to expand the boundaries of any proposed zone change, notice shall be given to all property owners within the proposed expansion boundaries. 
2.  A change in the boundaries of any zone may be initiated by the city council. 
3.  An application for a zone change may be filed concurrently with any other application(s) on the same property. 
4.  Following the denial of an application for a change in zone, an application for the same or substantially the same change on the same or substantially the same property shall not be accepted within one year of the date of denial. 
5.  A change in zone shall be indicated on the zoning map, along with a notation listing the number and date of each ordinance amending the zoning map, within the revision block of said map. 
C.  Application Procedure. 
1.  An application for a change of zone shall be made on a form provided for that purpose by the planning division, along with the required fee as established by city council resolution.

D.  Action by Planning Commission. 
1.  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on each application for a zone change. The hearing shall be set and notice given as prescribed in Section 17.03.030. The hearing may be continued from time to time. 
2.  The planning commission shall determine whether the proposed zone change is consistent with all of the required findings for approval as set forth in paragraph F of this section, and, if so, shall provide a written report recommending to the city council that the zone change be granted or granted in a modified form. If the planning commission determines that the proposed change does not meet the required findings for approval, the planning commission shall deny the application and their action is final, unless the matter is set for hearing pursuant to Section 17.03.110 and Section 65856 of the California Government Code. 
3.  When the planning commission determines, following a public hearing on a proposed zone change, that a change to a zone classification other than the proposed classification specified in the hearing notice is desirable, the commission may recommend an alternate classification, following new notice and public hearing. In making a modified recommendation, the planning commission must determine that the recommended alternative is more appropriate for the subject property and is consistent with the general plan and the Development Code. 
E.  Action by the City Council. 
1.  Upon recommendation of the planning commission to approve a proposed zone change, the city council shall hold a public hearing. The hearing shall be set and notice given as prescribed in Section 17.03.030. The hearing may be continued from time to time.

3.  The city council shall not modify a recommendation of the planning commission on a zone change until it has requested and considered a report of the planning commission on the modification. Failure of the planning commission to report within forty (40) calendar days after receipt of the council request shall be deemed to be in concurrence with the modification. 
F.  Required Findings for Approval. Approval of a change of zone shall be based on all of the following findings: 
1.  The proposed change in zone is consistent with the general plan; 
2.  The site of the proposed change in zone is suitable for any of the land uses permitted within the proposed zone district; 
3.  The proposed change in zone is reasonable and beneficial at this time; and 
4.  The proposed change in zone will not have a substantial adverse effect on surrounding properties or the community in general. 
G.  Pre-Zoning. 
1.  For the purpose of establishing zone district boundaries to become effective only upon annexation, property outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Big Bear Lake and within the adopted sphere of influence may be classified within one or more zones in the same manner and subject to the same procedural requirements as prescribed for property within the city. 
2.  Upon passage of an ordinance establishing the applicable pre-zoning designation for property outside the city, the zoning map shall be revised to show the potential or "pre-zoned" classification to become effective upon annexation. The zoning map shall also identify each zone or zones applicable to such property with the label "Pre-Zoning" or "PZ" in addition to such other map designation as may be applicable.

17.03.280 - Specific plan review. 
A.  Purpose and Applicability. The specific plan process is intended to provide a method of comprehensive planning for large scale, mixed-use development projects which are anticipated to be built in successive phases over a longer period of time than is typically granted for other development entitlements. Projects for which a specific plan would be appropriate would generally meet the following criteria: 
1.  The project site is not presently served by infrastructure and community services needed to support the proposed development, nor do comprehensive plans to provide these facilities exist. 
2.  The proposed mix and intensity of land uses, and their relationship to the project site, warrant consideration of special development standards and criteria beyond those otherwise provided in the Development Code. 
3.  Specific development plans for each portion of the subject property are not known at the time of project review, but are anticipated to be submitted subsequently as the project develops in conformance with the approved comprehensive development plan. 
4.  Due to the long-term nature of the project and the cost of providing substantial infrastructure improvements, an implementation plan addressing financing, phasing and maintenance of public improvements is necessary to ensure the project is developed in accordance with the general plan. 
B.  General Provisions. 
1.  A specific plan may be proposed within any zone district(s), provided that the proposed type and intensity of use is consistent with the general plan. 
2.  Adoption of a specific plan shall constitute a change of zone. Upon adoption, the official zoning map shall be revised to indicate the approved specific plan and its identification number. 
3.  Applications for a specific plan may be accompanied by other applications for entitlements, which may be reviewed concurrently, provided that the effective date of any additional approvals shall be on or after the effective date of the specific plan. 
4.  Any application for a specific plan shall be processed in accordance with Government Code Sections 65450 through 65457 and the provisions of this section of the Development Code. 
C.  Required Contents of a Specific Plan. 
1.  Narrative Report. The purpose of a specific plan narrative report is to describe the proposed development, place it within the regional setting, and provide detailed information necessary for plan review. The report may be organized in any manner necessary to present the required information. The report, however, must be clear, concise, and organized in a logical manner to facilitate review and processing. Maps, tables and graphic illustrations shall be required when appropriate. The required report contents shall be included as set forth in the specific plan application provided by the planning division, and shall include but not be limited to the following information: 
a.  Information regarding the property, developer, owner, representatives and consultants preparing the report; 
b.  Table of contents, including lists of maps and figures; 
c.  A discussion of the nature and intent of the proposed development; 
d.  A descriptive analysis of the project site; 
e.  Quantified information on the impacts of project build-out; 
f.  A development plan for all proposed land uses in the project (including open space); 
g.  A description of existing infrastructure, projected improvements needed to serve the project, and a plan for providing needed infrastructure, including community facilities; 
h.  A circulation plan for the project; 
i.  Development standards applicable to development within the specific plan; 
j.  Special design standards applicable to the project, including but not limited to signage, landscaping, fences and walls, lighting, and entry monumentation; 
k.  Proposed phasing of the project; 
l.  An implementation plan for the project; and 
m.  A discussion of how the project conforms to the general plan policies and maps. 
2.  Maps. The purpose of specific plan maps is to graphically depict characteristics of the project site, its regional setting, the proposed nature and intensity of development, project phasing, and other pertinent information needed for project review. All required maps must be submitted at a reduced scale suitable for inclusion in the narrative report, as well as at a larger scale suitable for display. Required contents of maps shall be as set forth in the specific plan application provided by the planning division, and shall include but not be limited to the following information: 
a.  Existing conditions of the project site, including topography, natural drainage courses, existing structures, roads, easements, uses, zoning and general plan designations; 
b.  The proposed development plan, including phasing; 
c.  The proposed circulation plan, including phasing; and 
d.  Any proposed landscape, design or amenity features. 
D.  Review Procedure. 
1.  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on each proposal for a specific plan. The hearing shall be set and notice given as prescribed in Section 17.03.030. The hearing may be continued from time to time. The planning commission shall determine whether the specific plan is consistent with this Development Code and with the general plan, and may recommend to the city council that the specific plan be approved, or approved in modified form by the city council, based on the appropriate findings as contained in this section. If the planning commission determines that a proposed specific plan is not in conformance with the general plan or that the findings for approval cannot be made, the planning commission may deny the application based upon the findings contained in this section, and their action is final unless appealed, pursuant to Section 17.03.110. 
2.  Upon recommendation of the planning commission on a proposed specific plan, the city council shall hold a public hearing. The hearing shall be set and notice given as prescribed in Section 17.03.030. The hearing may be continued from time to time. Following the closing of the public hearing, the city council shall make specific findings as to whether the specific plan is consistent with the Development Code and general plan. The city council may adopt the specific plan by ordinance or by resolution, based upon the appropriate findings as contained in paragraph E of this section. 
E.  Required Findings for Approval. Prior to approving a specific plan, all of the following findings supported by adequate evidence shall be made by the city council: 
1.  The distribution, location and extent of land uses, including open space, as depicted in the specific plan is consistent with the general plan; 
2.  The specific plan provides for adequate public infrastructure and services needed to support the land uses described in the plan, meaning the proposed distribution, location, extent and intensity of transportation, sewage, water, drainage, solid waste disposal, energy, parks, community facilities and other essential facilities; 
3.  The standards and development criteria, including requirements for resource utilization, will ensure that development proceeds in an orderly fashion and maintains a high level of quality; 
4.  The specific plan contains implementation measures, including financing programs, to ensure that development is supported by adequate infrastructure as it occurs; 
5.  The site is suitable for the type and intensity of development proposed; and 
6.  The flexibility in development standards afforded by the specific plan process has resulted in a project providing more superior design and amenities than would occur under more traditional zoning practices, and the project provides clear and substantial benefit to the City of Big Bear Lake. 
F.  Amendments and Modifications to Approved Specific Plans. Unless otherwise set forth within the specific plan, amendments or modifications to an approved specific plan shall be processed as follows: 
1.  Minor Revisions. A revision or modification to an approved specific plan, including but not limited to minor density transfers, minor adjustments to the alignment of roadways or utilities, minor modifications to landscaping, wall materials or streetscape design, which will not increase or change the use or intensity of the site, may be acted on by the city planner upon submittal of an application, required materials and applicable fees for a minor modification, pursuant to Section 17.03.250. 
2.  Amendments or Major Revisions. Any request for a revision or modification to an approved specific plan which, in the opinion of the city planner, does not constitute a minor revision will be processed as a major revision in the following manner: 
a.  An amendment or major revision to the text of an approved specific plan will be processed using the application procedures, review process and findings for approval as set forth for development code amendments in Section 17.03.200, in addition to the finding contained in Section 17.03.280.F.2.c. 
b.  An amendment or major revision to the land use map or land use exhibits of an approved specific plan will be processed using the application procedures, review process and findings for approval as set forth for zone changes in Section 17.03.190, in addition to the finding contained in Section 17.03.280.F.2.c. 
c.  Any approval of an amendment to a specific plan text or map shall also be based upon a finding that such amendment conforms to the intent and applicable goals and policies of the specific plan.

(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.03.315 - Enforcement of transient private home rental provisions.

1.  The term "city manager" shall mean the city manager of the City of Big Bear Lake, or his or her designee. 
2.  The term "TPHR Regulations" shall mean Section 17.03.310, this section, as well as the written regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph B of this section. 
3.  The term "managing agent" shall mean the managing agency," "property manager" or "agent" referred to in Section 17.03.310. 
B.  Implementing Regulations. The city manager shall have the authority to promulgate, from time to time, written implementing regulations governing the enforcement and interpretation of this section, provided that such written regulations shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this section or Section 17.03.310. 
C.  On-Call Service. In order to provide twenty-four (24) hour, on-call service for the receipt and transmission of complaints regarding violations of Section 17.03.310 or this section, the city shall, in compliance with all applicable laws, procure the services of one or more on-call service provider(s). Any such provider shall be required to maintain an office with employees physically present within the boundaries of the City of Big Bear Lake. In addition, any such provider shall have sufficient qualifications as may be deemed necessary by the city manager, as set forth in written regulations promulgated by the city manager. 
D.  Response/Response Time. Following the receipt by any owner or managing agent of any complaint (whether in writing, verbally or by any other tangible means) alleging a violation of Section 17.03.310 or this section, such owner or managing agent shall provide a response within one hour of receipt of such complaint. For purposes of this paragraph, a "response" shall mean a physical presence at the subject property by the owner or managing agent in which the occupant in charge of the transient private home rental is advised of the nature of the complaint and a correction of any violation is made, or if contact with such occupant is not required, the subject of the complaint is resolved, including the correction of any violation of Section 17.03.310 or this section. If the nature of the violation involves an action that would take more than an hour, the violation shall be deemed resolved (but only for purposes of computing the response time required by this paragraph) if the owner or managing agent notifies the city manager of the nature of the complaint and thereafter diligently pursues to completion the correction of the violation. Each owner or managing agent shall keep a written log of the times and nature of complaints received, which written log shall be made available to the city, upon request by the city. Occupants or visitors violating the provisions of Section 17.03.310 or this section and refusing to comply with the instructions of the owner or managing agent shall be ordered to vacate the premises by the owner or managing agent in accordance with provisions contained within the rental agreement. 
E.  In-Person Registration. The owner or managing agent shall, prior to entering into any agreement for the occupancy of a transient private home rental, provide an in-person registration, which shall include the review with at least one adult occupant of the transient private home rental of all TPHR Regulations. At the time of such registration, the occupant shall be provided a complete, written copy of all TPHR Regulations, including the penalties associated with their violation, as well as any other occupancy rules associated with the transient private home rental. The registration material shall advise the registrant that the transient private home rental unit shall not be used for any use that is not permitted by applicable law, including, without limitation, the use of such unit for weddings, wedding receptions, business conferences and meetings, scrap booking and other uses that violate the city's Development Code. Such written copy shall be provided in at least twelve (12) point, type-faced font, and shall contain a space for acknowledgement, and be acknowledged, by the occupant as having read, understood and agreed-to such provisions. 
F.  Registration Information. Registration documentation for every transient private home rental shall include, at a minimum, the following information, as well as such other information as may be promulgated by the city manager in implementing regulations:

3.  Financially responsible occupant(s), including the California driver's license number or California identification number. 
G.  Local Management. In order to ensure timely responses, unless the owner resides within fifteen (15) miles from the city's boundaries and provides property management services to such owner's transient private home rental unit(s) (in which case, all obligations of a managing agent contained in the TPHR Regulations shall be that of such owner), such owner shall engage the services of a managing agent that maintains a physical presence within fifteen (15) miles from the city's boundaries. 
H.  Parking. No person shall stop, park or leave standing any vehicle on any transient private home rental property, between the hours of eleven p.m. and seven a.m. of the following day, unless such vehicle properly displays a valid parking pass, as set forth herein. No person renting or occupying any transient private home rental unit shall park or leave standing within three hundred (300) feet of such transient private home rental unit, between the hours of eleven p.m. and seven a.m. of the following day, any vehicle that is listed within the registration information required by paragraph F. The owner or managing agent shall provide dated parking passes, in a form approved by the city manager, for use with registered vehicles. Such pass(es) shall indicate the number of vehicles that are authorized to be parked on-site at the transient private home rental property, which number shall not exceed the number of lawful parking spaces actually provided at such property. Failure to properly display such pass shall constitute a violation of this paragraph by the owner or user of such vehicle. 
I.  Occupancy Standards. Each occupant and visitor to a transient private home rental shall comply with all applicable provisions of this Code, including, without limitation, noise standards, anti-littering laws, occupancy limits, parking, and trespassing provisions. No occupant or visitor to a transient private home rental shall cause or permit a public nuisance to be maintained on such property. 
J.  Signage. 
1.  The signage required by Section 17.03.310 shall remain in place at all times that the transient private home rental unit is registered in the transient private home rental program. The signage required by Section 17.03.310.E may be provided by a freestanding exterior sign, but shall not be nailed, attached or otherwise affixed to a tree or other plant. Lettering for the signage required by Section 17.03.310.E.1 shall be a minimum of three inches in height (and a corresponding width), of a color that contrasts with the background upon which it is placed, and made of night reflective material or paint. The city may, but shall not be obligated to, provide a standard sign complying with the provisions of Section 17.03.310 and this section. The city may charge for such signage a cost not exceeding the reasonably estimated cost of such sign to the city. 
2.  Each transient private home rental unit shall contain property address lettering that is plainly visible (including around earthen or snow berms) from the street or public right-of-way that fronts the transient private home rental unit. In addition to the requirements of the TPHR Regulations, such lettering shall be a minimum of four inches in height (and a corresponding width), conform to the latest edition of the California Building Code, and shall be of a color that contrasts with the background upon which it is placed. Address numbers shall be either: (1) illuminated with an internally lit, low-voltage light; (2) internally lit with a solar-powered light, which shall be approved by the city manager in advance; or (3) self illuminated, as approved by the city manager. Any internally lit lettering shall be illuminated by a non-switched light source that is controlled by a photocell. Solar panels shall be located in a location that receives sun rays during daylight hours, and maintained by the owner or managing agent free of any leaves, snow or other debris that would tend to cause the photo cells to not receive charging rays. When the transient private home rental unit is located more than one hundred (100) feet from the street or public right-of-way that fronts the unit, additional property address lettering shall be required in a manner so as to comply with the provisions set forth in this subparagraph. 
K.  Advertising Regulations. No owner or managing agent shall advertise any transient private home rental in such a manner as to promote such unit for a use that is not permitted by applicable law, including, without limitation, the use of such unit for weddings, wedding receptions, business conferences and meetings, scrap booking and other uses that violate the city's Development Code. The penalty for violation of this paragraph shall be as follows. Following a written notification by the city manager, each owner and managing agent shall actively cease all advertising that is not in compliance with this paragraph within the following timeframes: seven days for any and all signs and internet-based ads, by the next publication date for printed media advertising provided by a bona fide third party publisher, prior to next media release for all other media advertisements. The city manager's written notification shall be sent to the owner of the transient private home rental unit, as well as any managing agent for such unit. If such written advertising is not corrected within the above-referenced time, the penalty for each and every day following such time frame shall be an infraction with a penalty of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00); provided, however, that for purposes of this section, one publication or media release lasting no longer than the above-referenced time frame shall constitute a single violation. For any violation of the same provisions within the same twelve (12) month period, the penalty for each and every day in which any violation of this paragraph exists shall be an infraction with a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00). Every owner and managing agent shall be responsible for compliance with this paragraph, provided however, that the city manager's implementing regulations may contain a policy providing that the managing agent shall be the entity primarily responsible for compliance with this paragraph. 
L.  Enforcement Provisions—Ownership/Management. The following penalties shall apply to the following persons, who shall be legally responsible for violations of Section 17.03.310 or this section. 
1.  For the first violation, the owner or managing agent shall be provided a verbal warning by the city manager, which verbal warning shall be notated in writing by the city manager. 
2.  Any owner and the managing agent causing or permitting to be caused a second violation of the same provision, at the same property, within a twelve (12) month period shall be punished with an infraction penalty, with a two hundred fifty dollar ($250.00) fine. Written notice of such second violation shall be provided by the city manager to the owner. 
3.  Any owner and the managing agent causing or permitting to be caused a third violation of the same provision, at the same property, within a twelve (12) month period shall be punished with an infraction penalty, with a five hundred dollar ($500.00) fine. In addition, for any such third violation during such twelve (12) month period, the unit(s) subject to such violations shall, as a penalty, be removed from the transient private home rental program for a twelve (12) consecutive month period, commencing as of the date of conviction or entry of a plea. 
4.  Any managing agent causing or permitting to be caused more than three violations of Section 17.03.310 or this section (exclusive of the verbal warnings pursuant to paragraph L.1), or any combination thereof, irrespective of whether such violations occur on the same or multiple properties, within a twelve (12) month period shall be punished with an infraction penalty, with a five hundred dollar ($500.00) fine for each such violation. 
5.  In addition to the penalties herein provided, for any additional violation beyond the first three violations during any twelve (12) month period (exclusive of the verbal warnings pursuant to paragraph L.1), irrespective of whether such violation(s) occur on the same or multiple properties, the managing agent shall not thereafter be permitted to manage, or represent the owner with respect to, the property(ies) at which the subject violations occurred. 
6.  Any managing agent causing or permitting to be caused more than five violations of Section 17.03.310 or this section, or any combination thereof (exclusive of the verbal warnings pursuant to paragraph L.1), irrespective of whether such violations occur on the same or multiple properties, within a twelve (12) month period shall be punished with an infraction penalty, with a five hundred dollar ($500.00) fine, and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the managing agent's business license of the management agency for a period of twelve (12) months pursuant to Section 5.02.180 of this Code. 
M.  Enforcement Provisions—Occupants/Visitors. The following penalties shall apply to any occupant or visitor of a transient private home rental unit, each of whom shall be responsible for compliance with Section 17.03.315.I. 
1.  For the first violation, the owner, managing agent, or the city shall provide a verbal warning to the occupant or visitor, which verbal warning shall be notated in writing by such owner, managing agent, or the city manager, as applicable. In addition, the owner shall be notified (verbally or in writing) of such violation, which notification shall include the nature of the violation, and which notification shall, if made verbally, be notated in writing by the managing agent, or the city, as applicable. 
2.  Any occupant or visitor of a transient private home rental unit causing or permitting to be caused a second violation of the same provision, at the same property, within a twelve (12) month period shall be punished with an infraction penalty, with a two hundred fifty dollar ($250.00) fine. 
3.  Any occupant or visitor of a transient private home rental unit causing or permitting to be caused a third or additional violations of the same provision, at the same property, within a twelve (12) month period shall be punished with an infraction penalty, with five hundred dollar ($500.00) fine. 
N.  Unregistered or Otherwise Non-Compliant Units. In the event any owner or management agent unlawfully causes or permits the rental or occupancy of a transient private home rental without first registering such unit in compliance with Section 17.03.310 or this section, or if such transient private home rental is otherwise in violation of Section 17.03.310 or this section, such owner or management agent shall be deemed to be in violation of this section. In such event, following a verbal warning described in subparagraph L.1, such owner and, as applicable, management company shall either: (1) cause the renter and any and all occupants of such non-registered unit to vacate the unit immediately and provide an alternative rental location to such tenant and occupant(s), at no additional cost or expense to such tenant or occupant(s); or (2) if the violation of Section 17.03.310 or this section can be corrected, correct the violation immediately. In the event such owner, and as applicable management agent, fails to do so, such owner, and as applicable management agent, shall, in addition to any other remedies available to the city, be subject to the penalties provided in subparagraph L.1 through L.5, inclusive, as applicable. 
O.  Enforcement Provisions—General. 
1.  Every act prohibited or declared unlawful and every failure to perform an act made mandatory by Section 17.03.310 or this section is punishable as an infraction, provided, that where the city attorney or citing officer determines that such action would be in the interests of justice, the city attorney or citing officer may specify in the accusatory pleadings that the offense shall be a misdemeanor. Every person who causes, aids, abets or conceals a violation of Section 17.03.310 or this section is guilty of violating Section 17.03.310 or this section, respectively. Each person, firm or corporation shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each day or portion thereof during which any violation of any provision of Section 17.03.310 or this section is committed, continued or permitted by such person, firm or corporation. An infraction is not punishable by imprisonment. A person charged with an infraction shall not be entitled to a trial by jury and shall not be entitled to have the public defender or other counsel appointed at public expense to represent him unless he or she is arrested and not released on his or her written promise to appear, his own recognizance, or a deposit of bail. 
2.  Violations of Section 17.03.310 or this section shall be treated as a strict liability offense regardless of intent. However, in either a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding, when determining whether or not to prosecute any owner or managing agent for violations caused by an occupant, or the extent to which such owner or managing agent shall be prosecuted for a violation caused by an occupant, the city shall consider the good faith efforts of the respective owner or property manager to reduce the likelihood of such violation(s). 
3.  In addition to the remedies provided by Section 17.03.310 or this section or elsewhere by law, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of Section 17.03.310 or this section shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be enjoined or abated by the city by means of a civil action or administrative abatement pursuant to Chapter 8.80 of this Code, and each day such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense. 
4.  In any civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding commenced by the city to abate a nuisance, to enjoin a violation of any provision of Section 17.03.310 or this section, or to collect a civil penalty imposed by this section, the city shall, if it is the prevailing party, be entitled to recover from the defendant in any such action reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit. 
5.  Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision or fails to comply with any requirement or provision of Section 17.03.310 or this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each violation. Each day of such conduct is a separate and distinct violation. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the court shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of the harm caused by the conduct constituting a violation, the nature and persistence of such conduct the length of time over which the conduct occurred, the assets, liabilities and net worth of the person, whether corporate or individual, and any corrective action taken by the defendant. The civil penalty prescribed by this subsection shall be assessed and recovered and a civil action brought by the city attorney in any court of competent jurisdiction. The civil penalty prescribed by this section may be sought in addition to injunctive relief, specific performance or any other remedy; provided, however, that a civil penalty shall not be sought for any violation for which a criminal prosecution has been commenced. 
(Ord. 2007-375 § 5, 2007) 
(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.03.320 - Nonconforming uses and structures. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The city's intent in adopting the provisions of this Development Code is to ensure that new and existing land uses and structures are brought into conformance with the goals and policies of the general plan. The eventual elimination of existing nonconforming uses and structures benefits the health, safety and welfare of the community, protects property values, promotes economic development, and protects residential neighborhoods, by abating substandard structures and promoting compatibility of land uses within zone districts. 
Notwithstanding the benefits of eliminating nonconformities, the city recognizes the financial investments, which may have been made in nonconforming properties, and the rights of individual property owners to yield a fair return or amortization from those investments. In addition, the city recognizes that the continuation of certain nonconforming conditions may not be detrimental to adjacent uses or properties, or the community in general, and that provisions are needed to allow for full use of nonconforming properties in these cases. 
Based on these considerations, the intent of this section is to limit the number and extent of nonconforming uses by prohibiting or limiting their enlargement, their reestablishment after abandonment, and their alteration or restoration after destruction of the structures they occupy. While permitting the continued use and maintenance of legal nonconforming structures, this section is intended to limit their continued number and extent by prohibiting their being moved, altered, or enlarged in a manner that would increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and the standards prescribed in this Development Code, and by prohibiting their restoration after destruction. It is also the intent of this section to establish regulations and procedures which ensure that the elimination of nonconforming uses and structures occurs as expeditiously and as fairly as possible, while avoiding any unreasonable limitations on established property rights. 
B.  General Provisions. 
1.  No property in the city shall be used for any purposes other than those permitted in the zoning district in which the property has been classified, except as provided in this section. 
2.  An existing use shall be deemed a "legal nonconforming use" if, prior to its establishment, the required permits were obtained or if the use was in compliance with codes and ordinances in existence at the time of establishment. Structures and uses not having acquired the permits required at the time of construction or establishment shall be considered "illegal" and shall be defined merely as "nonconforming," except as otherwise provided in this section. 
3.  Illegal uses or structures have no vested rights. Any use or structure which has been unlawfully established and which does not conform to the use provisions or development standards of the zone district in which it is located is in violation of the city's Development Code, and shall be deemed a public nuisance and shall be subject to all available measures for abatement and correction of the code violation(s) pursuant to the Municipal Code. 
4.  Any portion of a legal nonconforming structure or use that is altered or changed to a conforming structure or use may not thereafter be used for a nonconforming use. 
5.  Routine maintenance and repairs, such as painting, plumbing repair, and similar work, may be performed on a legal nonconforming use or structure to ensure the protection of public health, safety and welfare. All nonconforming uses and structures are subject to all applicable property maintenance and substandard building codes and ordinances. Alterations and repairs that are necessary to maintain public health, safety and welfare, as determined necessary by the chief building official, may be performed on a nonconforming use or structure subject to all applicable codes and regulations. 
6.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the establishment of special regulations for specific nonconforming uses and structures regulated by other sections of the Development Code. Such regulations may provide for the retirement or amortization of those specific uses and structures. 
7.  When a building or structure is relocated to another site, it shall be made conforming in all respects with the provisions of the Development Code and all other applicable laws and regulations. 
C.  Continuation of Nonconforming Uses and Structures. 
1.  A use lawfully occupying a structure or a site, that does not conform with the use provisions and development standards for the zone district in which the use is located, shall be deemed to be a legal nonconforming use and may be continued, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
2.  A structure lawfully occupying a site that does not conform with the development standards contained in the Development Code, including but not limited to standards for front yards, side yards, rear yards, height, lot coverage, distances between structures, and parking facilities for the zone district in which the structure is located, shall be deemed to be a legal nonconforming structure and may be used and maintained, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs C.1 and C.2 above, if any legal nonconforming use or structure is determined to be operated and/or maintained in such a manner as to be a nuisance, a blighted property, or a direct and substantial detriment to the right of other properties in the vicinity, then the nonconforming use or structure may be subject to the abatement and/or amortization provisions of this section. 
4.  Any one of the following occurrences shall immediately terminate the right to maintain and/or operate a nonconforming use or structure except as otherwise provided in this section: 
a.  Changing a nonconforming use to a use not permitted in the zoning district; 
b.  Increasing or enlarging the area, space or volume occupied by or devoted to a nonconformity; or 
c.  The addition to a nonconforming use of another use not permitted in the zoning district. 
D.  Existing Approvals. 
1.  Approved entitlements to use existing structures and/or property. Nothing in this section shall be deemed or construed to prevent the ultimate use of a project site, which has been approved or conditionally approved by the city prior to the effective date of this Development Code or any amendment thereto, provided that the use has been established as of such effective date. 
2.  Facilities Under Construction. Nothing in this section shall be deemed or construed to prevent the completion and use, in accordance with this section, of any building or structure under construction before the effective date of this Development Code or any amendment thereto, provided that all of the following conditions exist: 
a.  That such construction or the proposed use of such building or structure is not, at the effective date, in violation of any other law or regulation. 
b.  That the applicable grading and building permits have been issued and that substantial construction of such building has been performed and substantial liabilities have been incurred in good faith reliance on such permits. For the purposes of this section the issuance of a grading permit alone shall not constitute a vested right to develop and where the grading plan would result in a non-conformity, said permit shall be null and void on the effective date of this section. 
c.  That all applicable permits remain valid, reasonable progress toward completion is being made and that work has not been ceased for a continuous period of more than one hundred eighty (180) days. 
3.  Time Extensions. Time extension applications filed or under consideration after the effective date of the Development Code or any amendment thereto, shall be subject to the procedures, standards and regulations contained within this Development Code, as amended from time to time, on the date such application is approved. 
E.  Exceptions to Nonconforming Status. 
1.  Public utility facilities and uses. Nothing in this section pertaining to nonconforming buildings and uses shall be construed or applied so as to require the termination, or removal, or so as to prevent the modernization, replacement, repair, maintenance, alteration, or rebuilding of public service and public utility buildings, structures, uses, equipment and facilities; provided, that there is no change or increase of those areas to be occupied by such uses. 
2.  A nonconforming structure, which is determined by the city council to have historic or cultural value to the community may be deemed to be exempt from the requirements of this section regarding elimination of nonconforming uses and structures, and such structure may be maintained, rehabilitated, and expanded pursuant to applicable codes and ordinances. 
F.  Abandonment of Nonconforming Uses and Structures. 
1.  Whenever a nonconforming use has been abandoned, discontinued, or changed to a conforming use for a continuous period of one year or more, the nonconforming use shall not be reestablished, and the use of the site thereafter shall be in conformity with the zone district and development standards for the zone in which it is located. This section may not apply to nonconforming dwelling units. Discontinuance of a use shall include cessation of the existing nonconforming use, regardless of intent to resume said nonconforming use at some future time. 
2.  Loss of right to nonconforming parking. All nonconforming rights related to parking shall be lost if the primary structure on the lot is demolished. Rights shall not be lost if a building is merely vacated. 
3.  Abandonment/revocation of rights through nuisance, blight or detrimental effect upon adjoining, abutting or adjacent property. Any nonconforming use which is operated in such a way as to be a nuisance or a direct detriment to adjoining, abutting or adjacent properties or which is neglected to the point of being a blight on the community may be considered to have had its nonconforming rights abandoned, provided that the following process occurs: 
a.  A fully noticed public hearing shall be held before the planning commission; and 
b.  The planning commission, or city council on appeal, shall find that: 
(1)  The use adversely affects the health, peace or safety of persons residing or working on the premises or in the surrounding area; or

H.  Non-residential Nonconforming Uses and Structures. 
1.  Parking. 
a.  A use with nonconforming parking may change to another use without adding parking, except that if the new use would require more parking than the existing use, then the applicant must add parking equal to the difference between the parking requirement of the existing use and that of the new use (net change in parking intensity). 
b.  A use which is consistent with the zone district but which is nonconforming with respect to adequacy of parking may be expanded, provided that parking is provided for the expansion area in conformance with the parking requirement in effect at the time of said expansion. 
2.  Alterations and Expansions of Nonconforming Non-Residential Structures When the Use is Consistent With the Zone District. 
a.  Alterations to the exterior of a nonconforming structure when the use is conforming, and when there is no expansion of floor area or site area, may be permitted by approval of a minor modification, pursuant to Section 17.03.250. 
b.  Alterations and/or expansions of a nonconforming structure and/or site when the use is conforming that involve expansion of no more than twenty-five percent (25%) or five hundred (500) square feet, whichever is less, in floor area or site area, may be permitted by approval of a minor modification, pursuant to Section 17.03.250. 
c.  Alterations and/or expansion of a nonconforming structure and/or site when the use is conforming that involve expansion of greater than twenty-five percent (25%) in floor area or site area may be permitted by plot plan review approval, pursuant to Section 17.03.160. 
d.  For any proposed expansion of a nonconforming structure or site, where the use is conforming, of fifty percent (50%) or more of the floor area or site area, the city may require that the entire site be brought into conformance with applicable development standards and policies, to the extent these improvements can be reasonably accommodated on the site. For such expansions of less than fifty percent (50%), the city may require that the expansion area(s) be improved in compliance with applicable standards and policies. 
e.  A nonconforming building or structure which conforms as to use and complies with the building code, including the issuance of all necessary permits, but which does not conform to the development standards for the district within which it is located, may be altered, added to or enlarged only to the extent that such alteration, addition or enlargement and the use and occupancy thereof fully complies with the applicable development standards for the district within which it is located and with all other applicable regulations. 
f.  Accessory structures. Whenever a nonconforming structure is modified pursuant to this section, the city may require that nonconforming accessory structures and uses on the site be brought into conformance with applicable standards and policies. This includes but is not limited to trash enclosures, fences and walls, outdoor storage areas, exterior lighting, storage buildings and removal of unpermitted storage containers. This does not pertain to non-conforming signs, which are governed by Chapter 17.12. 
3.  Provisions for Nonconforming Non-Residential Uses. 
a.  In order to encourage and promote the conversion of nonconforming nonresidential uses to those which conform with the general plan and zoning designations, no expansion of these uses shall be allowed with respect to either site area or floor area, and no building expansions shall be permitted for these uses, except as provided in this section. 
b.  Any proposed alteration to a structure or site in which a nonconforming nonresidential use is located shall require approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission pursuant to Section 17.03.170. In addition to the findings for conditional use permit listed in Section 17.03.170.E, the planning commission shall make all of the following findings in approving any alteration to a nonconforming nonresidential use, or to a structure in which such use is located: 
(1)  The proposed alteration will not prolong the normal remaining life of the nonconforming use. 
(2)  The proposed alteration of the nonconforming use will not be detrimental to or prevent the attainment of goals, objectives, and policies specified in the general plan. 
(3)  The proposed alteration will not be detrimental to public health, safety, or welfare, or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and district in which the use is located. 
(4)  The proposed alteration will not change the primary use of the land or increase the intensity of that use. 
(5)  The existing nonconforming use and proposed alteration comply with all other applicable city policies, codes and ordinances regulating operation of such uses. 
c.  In approving a conditional use permit for alteration of a nonconforming nonresidential use, the planning commission may add conditions which it deems necessary and reasonably feasible to ensure that the nonconforming use is operated in a manner compatible with adjoining properties and the surrounding area and which are needed to reduce any adverse impacts from traffic, noise, light and glare, hours of operation, loading, screening of storage and refuse areas, or other aspects of site design and/or operation of the nonconforming use. 
d.  Any use which was originally established in a zone district by right and has since been reclassified as a use permitted by conditional use permit in that district shall obtain a conditional use permit prior to the expansion of the use or any structure related to the use. For the purposes of this section, an application to change an alcoholic beverage license to expand the range of beverages sold shall be considered an expansion of that use. 
I.  Repair and Restoration of Nonconforming Structures. 
1.  Ordinary maintenance, repairs and alterations may be made to a nonconforming structure, or a conforming structure occupied by a nonconforming use, provided that no structural alteration shall be made if the expense of the restoration exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost of the structure at the time the construction is proposed. Any nonconforming structure, or structure occupied by a nonconforming use which is partially destroyed may be restored, provided that restoration is started within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date of partial destruction and diligently pursued to completion. Whenever a nonconforming structure or structure occupied by a nonconforming use is damaged in excess of fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at the time of damage, the repair or reconstruction of the structure shall conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located and it shall be treated as a new structure, and any nonconformity shall be cured. 
2.  Disagreements with the interpretation of the provisions of this section shall be heard and resolved by the planning commission, subject to appeal to the city council. The burden of proof shall be on the owner to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the cost of repairs is less than fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost of the structure. 
3.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to excuse any owner, occupant or contractor from rebuilding or repairing any damaged structure in compliance with the requirements of the uniform construction codes, or any other health or safety requirements imposed by local, state, or federal law or regulation in effect at the time of the repair or rebuilding. 
4.  Whenever a nonconforming structure is voluntarily razed, or is required by law to be razed, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with the regulations for the district in which it is located, and the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. 
5.  In accordance with Government Code Section 65852.25(a), the restoration and reconstruction restrictions contained in this subsection shall not apply to any multifamily residential dwelling, which is currently occupied at the time it was involuntarily damaged or destroyed and which was legally constructed and occupied at the time of its initial construction. For purposes of this subsection, the phrase "multifamily residential dwelling" means any structure designed for human habitation that has been divided into two or more legally created independent living quarters. The application of the restrictions of this subdivision shall not apply to any multifamily residential dwelling which constituted a public nuisance prior to being involuntarily damaged or destroyed, which was abandoned for a period of one year prior to being involuntarily damaged or destroyed, or to any property for which the property owner requests a reduction in density on the property. Any reconstruction performed pursuant to this paragraph shall conform to the city's adopted construction codes at the time such reconstruction is undertaken. 
6.  In accordance with Government Code Section 65852.25(b), the reconstruction, restoration, or rebuilding of a multifamily dwelling may be prohibited if the planning commission determines that the reconstruction, rebuilding, or restoration will be detrimental or injurious to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood; or will be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood; or that the existing nonconforming use of the building or structure would be more appropriately moved to a zone in which the use is permitted; or that there no longer exists a zone in which the existing nonconforming use is permitted.

17.03.330 - Transitional uses and structures. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The intent of this section is to provide criteria for uses and buildings that are occupied by large retail commercial uses as designated with a footnote in Table 17.35.030.A that are subject to the provisions of Section 17.35.220 (Development Standards for Large Retail Uses). Existing large retail commercial uses and structures that occupy a building or collection of buildings on one parcel or adjacent parcel that exceeds a maximum of forty thousand (40,000) square feet shall be deemed transitional uses and structures. 
B.  General Provisions. 
1.  Transitional uses and structures for which permits were properly obtained and occupied with large retail commercial uses of greater than forty thousand (40,000) square feet of gross floor area established prior to the adoption of this ordinance may continue to operate and be occupied by large retail commercial uses. A new large retail use may occupy a transitional structure occupied by a large retail commercial use at the time of adoption of this ordinance, as long as there is no expansion of the floor area. 
2.  Ordinary maintenance and repairs, such as painting, plumbing repair, and similar work may be performed on transitional structures occupied by large retail uses prior to the adoption of this ordinance. 
3.  Alterations to the exterior of transitional structures may be allowed subject to approval of a minor modification, pursuant to Section 17.03.250, provided that there is no expansion of the floor area. 
4.  Transitional structures occupied by large retail commercial uses for which proper permits were obtained at the time of adoption of this ordinance that are damaged or destroyed may be rebuilt to the same footprint and gross square footage that existed at the time of adoption of this ordinance. The rebuilding of a damaged or destroyed structure shall comply with the requirements of the Uniform Construction Codes, or any other health or safety requirements imposed by local, state, or federal law or regulation in effect at the time of rebuilding. 
a.  The rebuilding of damaged or destroyed transitional structures in compliance with the maximum size for large retail commercial uses and structures provided in Section 17.35.050.A and Section 17.35.220 is strongly encouraged. Any rebuilding of damaged or destroyed transitional structures shall comply with the applicable development standards for the zone district within which it is located and with all other applicable regulations to the extent that these can be accommodated on the site. 
b.  A development incentive such as a reduction or waiver of development standards, including but not limited to parking, setback, open space, or architectural requirements may be approved by the reviewing authority when the damaged or destroyed transitional structure is reconstructed in conformance with the size limitations specified in Section 17.35.050.A and Section 17.35.220; and when the reviewing authority finds that such waiver or reduction promotes and maintain Big Bear Lake's unique mountain setting and shopping experience, and does not conflict with the health, safety and welfare of the general public. 
5.  Whenever a transitional structure is voluntarily razed, or is required by law to be razed, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with the regulations for the district in which it is located, including Section 17.35.050.A and Section 17.35.220. 
6.  Any interpretation of the provisions of this section shall be heard and resolved by the planning commission, subject to appeal to the city council.

(Ord. No. 2009-387, § 1, 3-23-2009)  
17.04.020 - Intent and purpose. 
The city council hereby finds and declares: 
A.  The city has significant interests in: (1) promoting vehicular traffic and pedestrian safety and convenience on private property; (2) preventing visual clutter on private property, and (3) protecting the aesthetic character of an area by regulating the placement of newsracks on private property. 
B.  The city has a substantial interest in promoting the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of its citizens, businesses and visitors by ensuring that areas on private property are not unreasonably obstructed by newsracks and that newsracks on private property are properly maintained. 
C.  The city has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting the unique visual and aesthetic qualities of the city. To that end, and consistent with the city's general plan, the city desires to take steps to reduce the visual blight, pedestrian inconvenience and hazards associated with an unlimited number and design of newsracks on private property, poorly maintained newsracks on private property and the unrestricted and unregulated placement of newsracks on private property. 
D.  Thus, the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and welfare and the aesthetic qualities of the city by controlling the size, shape, construction and appearance of newsracks on private property, as a reasonable time, manner and place regulation, so as to: 
1.  Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience; 
2.  Ensure that there is no unreasonable interference with the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, including ingress and egress from any city residence, place of business or public facility, or any legally parked or stopped vehicles; 
3.  Ensure compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act and improve passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused by poorly-located newsracks; 
4.  Reduce visual blight and clutter and litter problems associated with poorly maintained or improperly located newsracks; 
5.  Advance the economic interests of the city merchants and other information providers, including those involved in the publication and distribution of newspapers and periodicals through newsracks; 
6.  Protect the unique architectural, historical and aesthetic attributes of the city; 
7.  Reduce exposure of the city, property owners and businesses to personal injury or property damage claims and litigation; 
8.  Provide for public and property safety during emergency conditions; and 
9.  Maintain and protect the values of surrounding properties. 
E.  In adopting this chapter, the city council is mindful that newsrack regulations implicate rights protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 2 of the California Constitution. To that end, the city council hereby adopts these regulations and directs that their enforcement be conducted in a manner consistent with the constitutional rights of citizens and regulated parties. 
F.  The city council further declares that allowing only newsracks on private property of a consistent design, placement and color in the city directly promotes the city's interests in promoting public safety, reducing visual blight and clutter, protecting the unique aesthetic and historical characteristics of the Village "L", and advancing the economic interests of the city merchants and other information providers.

Chapter 17.09 - SLOPE DENSITY 
Sections: 
 
17.09.010 - Purpose and intent. 
These regulations are intended to: 
A.  Recognize that the hillside areas of the city of Big Bear Lake form an integral part of the city's natural scenic beauty. The city's landforms are a nonrenewable resource and once destroyed may hinder the tourist industry upon which the city's economic health depends. Hillside protection measures provided for in this chapter will form a key measure in ensuring that development in hillside areas will support the continued aesthetic and economic well-being of the city of Big Bear Lake; 
B.  Ensure that design and development of building sites protects public health and safety, and safeguards and enhances the quality of life, especially in those areas with a gradient greater than thirty percent (30%) and most vulnerable to wildfire hazard, landslides, and other life-threatening disasters; 
C.  Prohibit all development in areas with steep gradients regardless of zoning unless measures for mitigating adverse environmental impacts can be found; 
D.  Maximize the choice of environments available in the city for development and encourage a variety of developmental patterns in hillside areas; 
E.  Encourage a full understanding of current practices in good mountain design, architecture, landscape architecture, and civil engineering to preserve, enhance, and promote the existing and future well-being and appearance of the hillside areas of the city; 
F.  Encourage the preservation and enhancement of the city's natural scenery by retaining natural topographic features, such as drainage swales, streams, slopes, ridge lines, rock-outcroppings, vistas, natural plant formations, and trees; 
G.  Discourage, insofar as is feasible and reasonable, the padding or terracing of building sites in hillside areas; 
H.  Promote a safe means of ingress and egress for vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and within hillside areas while minimizing possible scarring effects of hillside street construction. Roads should follow the natural topography wherever possible to minimize cutting and grading.

17.09.020 - Development procedures and standards. 
A.  General Provisions. The development procedures and standards provided in this chapter shall be applicable to all development within the city of Big Bear Lake, including the division of land. 
B.  Slope Limitation. Development shall be prohibited in areas with an average slope of forty percent (40%) or greater. Any subdivision proposed under the Subdivision Map Act shall be designed so that no lots are unbuildable because of this limitation. 
C.  Slope Analysis. A slope analysis shall be submitted with all development permit applications that will result in the construction of structures or the division of land. 
1.  The adjusted average slope shall be calculated by the following method: 
S 	= 	I × L 	× 	100 
		A 		
 
where: 
S = 	adjusted average slope expressed in a percentage; 
I = 	interval of topographic contours in feet; 
L = 	length of contour lines of subject property in feet; 
A = 	area of subject property in square feet, less any area with a slope over forty percent (40%) or greater. 
 
"Adjusted average slope" means the average slope of a subject property excluding any areas with a slope of forty percent (40%) or greater. 
2.  The slope analysis shall include: 
a.  A topographic base map of the proposed project site which shows the natural grade at a scale of not less than one inch to two hundred (200) feet. The contour interval shall be five feet for slopes ten percent (10%) or greater and two feet for slopes less than ten percent (10%). Contour lines are to be obtained by aerial or field survey, done under the supervision of a land surveyor, registered engineer, or registered landscape architect; 
b.  Computations for the adjusted average slope for the proposed project site using the method specified in subsection (C)(1) of this section; 
c.  Indication on the topographic base map or an overlay of any areas of the proposed project site having a natural slope of forty percent (40%) or greater. 
D.  Land Coverage. The maximum allowable land coverage shall be calculated and submitted for all development that will result in the construction of structures or division of land. 
1.  Maximum allowable land coverage shall be calculated by the following method: 
C = 	X 	- 	S 2 
			40% 
 
where: 
C = 	maximum allowable land coverage expressed in a percentage; 
X = 	maximum coverage otherwise allowed by the Development Code; 
S = 	adjusted average slope obtained from subsection (C)(1) of this section; 
 
40% = maximum slope. 
The following represents a graphic illustration of this formula for R-1 zones: 
SLOPE/COVERAGE 
 
2.  The entire parcel shall be taken into consideration when determining the allowable land coverage, including those areas of forty percent (40%) or greater gradient. The maximum allowable land coverage may be permitted for projects that the planning commission finds to represent outstanding and innovative design, site planning, and engineering techniques. However, a project which to some lesser extent meets the above-stated requirements may be limited to less than the maximum allowable coverage. 
3.  All portions of the site occupied or covered by impermeable surfaces including buildings, pavement, and grading, except for recreation facilities and active recreation areas that can be utilized by all residents of a multi-unit development or the general public, shall be included in the maximum allowable land coverage. 
E.  Preliminary Grading Plan. A preliminary grading plan shall be filed with the city engineer with all permit applications that will result in the construction of roads or structures or the division of land. 
1.  The preliminary grading plan shall include the following: 
a.  A topographic map of the proposed project area and all adjoining properties within one hundred fifty (150) feet as described in subsection (C)(2)(a) of this section; 
b.  Contours of the finished slope shown at intervals similar to the topographic base map; 
c.  Street grades, which shall not exceed a twelve percent (12%) gradient, driveway grades, which shall not exceed a fourteen percent (14%) gradient, pad elevations, maximum elevation of top and minimum elevation of toe of finished slopes over three feet in vertical height, the maximum heights of those slopes, and approximate total cubic yard of cut and fill; 
d.  Compliance with the grading provisions contained in the latest edition of the California Building Code, as adopted by the city of Big Bear Lake. 
2.  In the event no such grading is proposed, a statement to that effect shall be filed with a plan that delineates the boundary of the building pad and driveway for each parcel proposed, to be prepared on a topographic map described in subsection (C)(2)(a) of this section. 
F.  Geologic Report. Unless otherwise waived in writing by the city engineer, a detailed geologic report shall be filed with the city engineer with all development permit applications where any part of the lot area to be developed contains slopes with a natural grade of thirty percent (30%) or greater and will result in the construction of roads or structures or the subdivision of land. 
G.  Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan. Unless otherwise waived in writing by the city engineer, a detailed soil erosion and sediment control plan shall be filed with the city engineer with all development permit applications where any part of the lot area to be developed contains slopes with a natural grade of thirty percent (30%) or greater and will result in the construction of roads or structures or the subdivision or any other grading of land. 
H.  Cuts and Fills. 
1.  Maximum cuts and fills of up to ten (10) feet each in vertical height at up to 2:1 horizontal to vertical slope with provisions for slope and soil stability may be permitted by the city engineer, if the following findings can be made: 
a.  All cuts and fills will be substantially landscaped to restore the aesthetic and scenic values of the site. 
b.  Cuts and fills will be minimized to prevent scarring of the hillsides; graded contours will be matched and blended with the natural contours found onsite and finished in a manner to resemble natural topography that would normally occur. 
c.  Exposed retaining walls shall not exceed a maximum height of eight feet. 
2.  Development projects in all zones that propose to exceed the maximum cut and fill standards shall require a conditional use permit. Review of grading plans for such projects itemized in subsection (H)(1) of this section shall be conducted during the development review process by the community development department and approved by the planning commission. 
I.  Single-Family Residential Uses on Existing Lots of Record. 
1.  All single-family residential development proposed to be constructed on existing lots of record as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter where natural slopes on all parts of the lot to be developed are less than thirty percent (30%) shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter and the maximum allowable land coverage shall be as set forth in Section 17.25.050 of the Development Code. 
2.  Unless otherwise waived in writing by the city engineer, all single-family residential development proposed to be constructed on existing lots of record as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter where natural slopes on any part of the lot to be developed are at or exceed a thirty percent (30%) gradient shall be exempt from subsection C (slope analysis) and subsection D (maximum allowable land coverage) of this section and the maximum allowable land coverage shall be as set forth in Section 17.25.050 of the Development Code if the plans for the proposed project are prepared by a licensed architect or engineer. 
3.  All single-family residential development proposed to be constructed on existing lots of record as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be exempt from Section 17.09.030.C of this chapter (conditional use permit for encroachments into forty percent (40%) slope area). Notwithstanding this exemption, a conditional use permit shall be required for any grading not in compliance with the standards contained in subsection I.1 of this section. All single-family residential development proposed to be constructed on existing lots of record as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be reviewed by the development review committee (DRC) if natural slopes on any part of the lot that will be developed are at or exceed a forty percent (40%) gradient and plans for the proposed project are prepared by a licensed architect or engineer. The applicant shall remit the appropriate fee as adopted by the city council, which may be amended from time to time.

(Ord. No. 2014-432, § 2(Exh. A), 6-23-2014)  
17.10.040 - Development requirements for major projects. 
A.  Pre-Development Review. 
1.  For any major project on land which contains one or more significant stands of trees where it is proposed to remove a significant portion of one or more of these stands of trees, a pre-development review shall be required pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Development Code. The purpose of this review is to ensure that tree conservation is considered early in the planning process with respect to placement of buildings, roads and driveways, parking, utilities, and other site improvements. 
2.  A tree delineation map shall be required for the pre-development review meeting with the development review committee. This map shall show existing grades, location and size of groups of similar trees (stands), and any trees which may be significant due to their size. 
3.  Conceptual development plans submitted at the pre-development review phase shall show one or more methods of ensuring that tree conservation has been considered in project design. In general, development plans should consider the following: 
a.  With the recommendation of a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture, new and existing trees may be incorporated into structures or decks. Any recommendations of a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture regarding the size, type, or location to ensure viability of such trees shall be included into the project approval. 
b.  In evaluating tree preservation with respect to building placement, consider the relative health and viability of trees. Healthy trees of varying ages should be considered for preservation, rather than removing several younger trees in order to save an older specimen tree, which may be over-mature. 
B.  Development Review. 
1.  For major projects on sites containing existing trees twelve (12) inches or greater DBH; a tree management plan shall be submitted concurrently with the formal application. Failure to provide this information will result in a determination that the application is incomplete. The tree management plan shall contain the following components, except as otherwise waived by the city planner based on inapplicability to the proposed project: 
a.  A plan showing the location of each tree twelve (12) inches or greater DBH on the site and within ten (10) feet of the site perimeter. 
b.  Existing grades and the base elevation of each tree shown on the plan. 
c.  A table keyed to the tree location plan, which indicates species, diameter, condition and health, recommendations on saving or removal of the tree, and any special considerations. This information shall be prepared by a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture. 
d.  Trees proposed to be removed for sanitation harvesting based on recommendations of a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture. 
e.  Trees proposed to remain after development, and trees proposed for removal; 
f.  Details indicating how remaining trees and their critical root zones will be protected during and after construction. This shall include a delineation of the area in which construction equipment shall be prohibited; 
g.  Any proposed grade changes within the drip line of trees to remain, and how trees will be protected from changes in grade through use of permanent tree protection devices; 
h.  Locations of construction equipment staging and materials storage during construction; 
i.  Locations of proposed-underground utilities or other trenching, including storm drains, sewers, area drains, gas lines, electrical service, cable TV and water mains. All lateral lines serving the site shall be shown and shall be located so as not to damage remaining trees; 
j.  Locations of overhead utility lines which could impact existing or proposed trees; 
k.  Locations of proposed areas of new landscaping which could impact existing trees, including type of vegetation and irrigation proposed; 
l.  Locations of streams, wetlands or drainage courses, and any proposed changes to drainage patterns, which could impact trees; 
m.  If deemed appropriate, a photographic record of trees affected by development may be required. 
2.  The tree management plan shall be prepared and evaluated in consideration of the following criteria: 
a.  Tree locations should be reviewed in relation to planned roads, driveways, pavement, structures, overhead utility lines and underground utility trenches, to ensure that trees will not be damaged by construction or development. If the critical root zone of any existing tree will be significantly damaged during construction, or if the tree will conflict with any structure or improvement, the site should be redesigned or the tree should be removed. At least sixty percent (60%) of the critical root zone should remain undisturbed from construction for any tree proposed to remain on site. 
b.  With the recommendation of a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture new and existing trees may be enclosed within rooflines or decking of structures. Any recommendations of the California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture regarding the size, type, or location to ensure viability of such trees shall be included into the project approval. 
c.  The critical root zone of a tree should not be paved over or encased in planters or other enclosures, which could change the grade at the base of the tree. 
d.  Grading or landscaping techniques that involve backfilling of soil around trees is not allowed. 
e.  The design of structures, improvements and site grades should conform to the natural topography of the site to the extent feasible, to ensure survival of remaining trees. 
f.  Consideration should be given to setting aside a natural vegetation area on the site that will be free from development, instead of trying to save individual trees within developed areas. 
g.  Trees that are the best candidates for survival should be identified based on the information provided by a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture. 
h.  When possible, no paving should be allowed within a distance from the base of the tree of four feet or the diameter of the tree (DBH), whichever is greater. Within the drip line, if a hard surface is required, use of porous materials such as bricks, pavers or other pervious materials should be used. 
i.  The proposed site drainage plan should be reviewed for changes to surface water runoff that would affect trees. Final site drainage should not allow surface water to pond around the base of trees. 
j.  Utility trenches should avoid the critical root zone of any mature tree to be retained on site, or minimize encroachment to the extent feasible. The width or depth of utility trenches is not a consideration, since the cutting of roots for any size trench may damage a tree severely. To the extent feasible, utilities should be run along the edge of driveways or other paved areas to minimize impacts to trees. 
k.  In order to encourage preservation of healthy trees on development sites, the reviewing authority may grant a reduction in the number of required parking spaces for the use(s) proposed within a development project, based on the following criteria: 
(i)  For uses requiring ten (10) parking spaces or less on the site, no more than one parking space credit may be granted in exchange for preservation of one or more trees. 
(ii)  For uses requiring between eleven (11) and twenty (20) parking spaces on the site, no more than two parking space credits may be granted in exchange for tree preservation, as determined by the reviewing authority. 
(iii)  Or uses requiring twenty-one (21) or more parking spaces on site, up to fifteen percent (15%) of the required parking spaces may be reduced in exchange for tree preservation, at a ratio of one parking space for each tree preserved, as approved by the reviewing authority. For the purposes of calculating tree credits, rounding up to the next whole number shall not be allowed. 
(iv)  Any trees for which parking space credits are granted shall be determined by a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture to be healthy trees with long-term viability. Development plans shall demonstrate tree preservation measures within the final design as well as during construction. 
(v)  If a tree for which a parking space credit was granted does not survive in a healthy state thirty-six (36) months after construction is completed, a replacement tree, selected from Exhibit 1 (Trees of Big Bear Valley), shall be required and have a minimum diameter of three to four inches measured at a point one foot above natural grade. 
C.  Preparation of Landscape Plans. 
1.  All applicants for major projects may be required to prepare landscape plans for city for review and approval which incorporate trees, including new trees, new replacement trees, and existing trees, regardless of whether the development site contains existing trees or is devoid of trees at the time such development is proposed. Required landscape plans may include the following: 
a.  A preliminary landscape plan may be required prior to conditional approval by the reviewing authority for a discretionary project; and 
b.  A final landscape and irrigation plan may be required for review and approval prior to issuance of any grading or building permits for the project, if required by the reviewing authority. The final landscape and irrigation plan shall be consistent with the conceptual project approved by the reviewing authority, including any conditions of approval. 
2.  For any trees over twelve (12) inches DBH on the project site which are proposed for removal, a replacement tree shall be shown on the landscape plans, except as otherwise recommended by a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture. Except as recommended by a California Registered Professional or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture, replacement trees shall have a diameter of three to four inches measured at a point one foot above natural grade. All of the replacement trees shall be selected from Exhibit 1, and a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of those trees selected shall be Jeffrey pine, except as otherwise approved. 
3.  In order to preserve the character of Big Bear Lake's native Jeffrey pine forest and in keeping with the surrounding natural environment, it is strongly encouraged that trees from the list on Exhibit 1 of this chapter be used in the planting plan. Other trees may be used for special effect, provided that at least some native trees are used on each site. Landscaping should include a mixture of ages and species to provide a continual forest canopy with diversity in form, color, and ability to withstand disease and insects. 
4.  Trees used within and adjacent to parking lots and paved areas should be chosen to minimize breakup of pavement due to root growth and avoid dropping heavy cones, sap and other materials onto vehicles. All parking areas shall be designed to incorporate shade during summer months and solar exposure during winter months; use of deciduous trees is encouraged. At least one tree for every six parking spaces shall be planted throughout the parking lot, which may include planter islands and/or along the perimeter of the lot, where appropriate. 
5.  Adequate area should be provided on site to allow full growth and spread of the tree's canopy at maturity, in order to avoid structural damage or premature tree removal. Conifers in Big Bear Lake may grow thirty-six (36) to forty-eight (48) inches in diameter at the trunk base, and the root spread is never less than the spread of the canopy. 
6.  Consideration should be given to shade and sunlight requirements, soil type and moisture, and site runoff in tree placement. Areas where ice melt or similar substances or chemicals will be used for ice removal in winter months should not be allowed to drain into landscape areas containing trees. 
7.  Plants placed within the dripline of any native conifer or oak tree shall be drought resistant and require no more water than the native tree. Drip irrigation systems may be used in these areas if irrigation is needed. 
8.  Erosion control shall be provided on any disturbed bare areas and cut slopes. 
(Ord. No. 2014-432, § 2(Exh. A), 6-23-2014)  
17.10.045 - Tree conservation requirements during construction. 
A.  The following tree protection guidelines shall be incorporated as construction notes into all building plans for major projects including but not limited to the following: site, grading, street improvement, curb, gutter and sidewalk, water quality, drainage, public and private utilities, and any plan that proposes construction that may have an impact on trees to be protected. 
B.  All construction plans impacting a tree identified to be retained in the TMP must be approved by a State of California licensed landscape architect, California Registered Forrester or arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). 
C.  A pre-construction meeting shall be conducted by the building and safety division prior to commencement of any construction on a site with any existing trees of twelve (12) inches DBH or greater, and the provisions of this section shall be reviewed with the contractor.

G.  Fences shall completely surround the tree or clusters of trees and be located at the limits of the drip line as defined by Section 17.10.020(K) of the Development Code. In no case shall less than sixty percent (60%) of the CRZ be left unprotected. 
H.  Fences shall be maintained throughout the construction project in order to protect the following: 
1.  Soil compaction in the drip line areas resulting from vehicular traffic or storage of equipment or material. 
2.  Disturbances within the drip line areas due to grade changes or trenching not reviewed and authorized by the City of Big Bear Lake. 
3.  Wounds to exposed roots, trunk, or limbs by mechanical equipment. 
4.  Other activities detrimental to trees such as chemical storage, concrete truck cleaning, and fires. 
I.  Exceptions to installing tree fences at the tree drip line may be permitted in the following cases if a four-inch layer of organic mulch is placed within the drip line of the tree and the plan is approved by a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture: 
1.  Where trees are close to proposed buildings. 
2.  Where there are severe space constraints such as building size or other special requirements. 
3.  Where any of the above exceptions result in areas of unprotected root zones those areas should be covered with four inches of organic mulch to minimize soil compaction. 
M.  If possible all grading within drip line areas shall be done by hand or with small equipment to minimize root damage prior to grading. 
N.  Any roots exposed by construction activity shall be pruned flush with the soil and backfilled with good quality topsoil within one day. If exposed root areas cannot be backfilled within one day, an organic material which reduces soil temperature and minimizes water loss due to evaporation shall be placed to cover the roots until backfill can occur. 
O.  Prior to excavation or grade cutting within the CRZ or drip line areas, a clean cut shall be made with a rock saw or similar equipment in a location and to a depth approved by the project landscaper or arborist to minimize damage to remaining roots. 
P.  Trees most heavily impacted by construction activities shall be watered deeply once a week with a minimum of five gallons per inch of tree diameter applied at the drip line during periods of hot, dry weather including but not limited to the months of June through October. 
Q.  When installing concrete within the CRZ or drip line area, a plastic vapor barrier shall be placed underneath the concrete to prohibit the leaching of lime. 
R.  Any trenching required for the installation of landscape irrigation, on and offsite utilities, drainage lines, underground vaults and structures shall whenever possible be located outside the CRZ. In no case shall more than sixty percent (60%) of the CRZ be disturbed. 
S.  No landscape topsoil dressing greater than four inches shall be permitted within the CRZ. No topsoil is permitted on root flares of any tree. 
T.  Pruning to provide clearance for structures, vehicular traffic, and construction equipment shall take place before construction begins. All pruning must be done according to the standards as outlined in literature provided by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA Pruning Techniques). 
U.  The city has the authority to modify the tree protection plan before or during construction. 
V.  Trees approved for removal shall be removed in a manner which does not impact trees to be preserved. 
W.  Deviations from the above requirements and negligent damage to trees may be subject to a stop work order and/or subject to revised landscape plan approval as proscribed by Section 17.10.030(D) and (E) of the Development Code. 
X.  If any of the trees required to be retained or planted as part of the approved landscaping plan should die within a period of forty-eight (48) months after completion of the activities associated with land disturbance, the owner of the property shall replace the trees within six months at a ratio of one-to-one with an approved tree having a diameter of three to four inches measured at a point one foot above natural grade. 
Y.  For multi-family, commercial, and industrial projects only: The city may require surety in the form of a bond or other method as approved by the city planner and city attorney, to ensure that trees to be preserved and/or planted on the site are protected during construction, and remain viable and healthy for twenty-four (24) months after issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 2014-432, § 2(Exh. A), 6-23-2014)  
17.10.050 - Development requirements for minor projects. 
A.  Plan Submittal Requirements. For minor projects involving building, grading, paving and/or demolition permits which do not require planning commission approval, and which have the potential to impact or cause removal of existing trees twelve (12) inches or greater DBH, the grading and/or construction plans shall show the following information: 
1.  The location, base elevation, DBH, species, condition, and critical root zone of all existing trees, which will be affected by the limits of construction. For purposes of this section, the limits of construction shall include any equipment or materials storage areas and/or temporary drive aisles, utility trenching, and other associated activities. All trees affected by proposed construction, both on the subject site and adjacent properties, shall be shown on the plan. 
2.  Indication of which trees are proposed for removal and which trees are proposed to remain. 
3.  Locations of proposed structures, paving, utilities, and areas to be protected, in relation to trees. 
4.  Any proposed grade changes within the drip line of trees to remain, and how trees will be protected from changes in grade through use of permanent tree protection devices. 
B.  Plan Review Standards. In approving grading and construction plans proposing to remove or impact existing trees twelve (12) DBH or greater, the reviewing authority shall ensure that the following conservation measures are shown on the plans: 
1.  Site shall be designed so as to avoid removal of existing healthy trees, where feasible. Where some tree removal is necessary to accommodate the proposed development, consideration should be given to conserving significant stands of trees, healthy trees, trees of varying species and ages, and trees which due to their size, shape, location and/or appearance are considered to be significant. 
2.  Tree locations should be reviewed in relation to planned roads, driveways, pavement, structures, overhead utility lines and underground utility trenches, to ensure that trees will not be damaged by construction or development. If the root system of any existing tree will be significantly damaged during construction, or if the tree at maturity will conflict with structures, the site should be redesigned or the tree should be removed. At least sixty percent (60%) of the critical root zone should remain undisturbed from construction for any tree proposed to remain on site. 
3.  With the recommendation of a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture, new and existing trees may be enclosed within rooflines or decking, to avoid future structural damage or injury to the tree. Any recommendations of a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture regarding the size, type, or location to ensure viability of such trees shall be included into the project approval. 
4.  The base of a tree should not be paved over or encased in planters or other enclosures, which would change the grade at the base of the tree. 
5.  Grading or landscaping techniques that involve backfilling soil around trees is not allowed. The original grade should be maintained within the drip line of existing trees. 
6.  The design of structures, improvements and site grades should conform to the natural topography of the site to the extent feasible, to ensure survival of remaining trees. 
7.  When possible, no paving should be allowed within a distance from the base of the tree of four feet or the diameter of the tree (DBH), whichever is greater. Within the drip line, if a hard surface is required, use of porous materials such as bricks, pavers or other pervious materials should be used. 
8.  Every effort should be made to install utility trenches outside the critical root zones. Trenches are to be backfilled as soon as possible. 
9.  Where deemed appropriate by the reviewing authority, a condition of approval requiring tree replacement may be applied to the permit in order to achieve the objectives of this chapter. 
C.  Tree Conservation During Construction. In order to ensure tree conservation during construction or grading for ministerial projects, the provisions of Section 17.10.45, tree conservation during construction, of this chapter shall be noted on the grading and construction plans. 
D.  Approval by Reviewing Authority. Plans submitted pursuant to this section may be approved by the reviewing authority upon finding that: 
1.  The plans contain all information required by this section; and 
2.  The plans comply with the conservation requirements of this section.

17.10.060 - Tree removal permit. 
A.  Except as specified in Paragraphs (E) and (F) of this section, in cases where there is no approval of a discretionary project or a ministerial project, but where removal of one or more trees twelve (12) inches or greater DBH is proposed, the property owner or authorized representative shall be required to obtain a tree removal permit from the City of Big Bear Lake. Approval of discretionary or ministerial projects, which include review of tree conservation plans, shall constitute the tree removal approval and no separate tree removal permit shall be required in these cases. 
B.  In cases where removal of one or more healthy trees twelve (12) inches or greater in diameter is proposed for reasons other than those listed in Paragraphs (E) or (F) of this section, the applicant for a tree removal permit shall provide the following information to the city planning division: 
1.  The address and assessor's parcel number of the property; 
2.  Proof of property ownership, or the permission of the property owner to remove the tree(s); 
3.  The number, general location, DBH, species and general condition of each tree proposed for removal; 
4.  Photographs of each tree proposed for removal; 
5.  A written explanation stating the reason for the proposed tree removal; 
6.  The required fee as established by city council. 
C.  The request for a tree removal permit shall be evaluated by the city planner or his/her designee, and shall be approved if all of the following findings can be made: 
1.  The tree removal is reasonable and beneficial because such removal conforms to policies of the general plan and this chapter, and promotes public health, safety and welfare; 
2.  The tree removal will not substantially diminish the overall forest canopy within the vicinity or significantly change the character of the site from that of a mountain environment, such that the purpose and intent of this chapter as set forth in Section 17.10.010 can be met on the site if the permit is granted; 
3.  The tree removal will not affect an eagle perch tree; and 
4.  An approved tree having a diameter of three to four inches measured at a point one foot above natural grade will be planted on the site for each tree removed, where deemed appropriate by the reviewing authority. 
D.  Conditions of approval may be applied to a tree removal permit to ensure that the tree is removed and treated in accordance with recommended practices. 
E.  When it has been determined by the Big Bear Lake Fire Protection District or the California Department of Forestry that a tree should be removed because it is in decline, is infested or diseased, has died, is structurally unsound, or poses a threat to buildings, life, safety, and/or property, the fire protection district shall provide written notification to the planning division, which shall serve as a tree removal permit for the property owner, and no fee will be assessed for a tree removal permit in these cases. 
F.  When it has been determined by a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture or California Department of Forestry that a tree should be removed because it is in decline, is infested or diseased, has died, is structurally unsound, or poses a threat to buildings, life, safety, and/or property, the property owner shall provide documentation of such determination to the City, which shall serve as a tree removal permit and no fee shall be assessed for a tree removal permit in these cases. 
(Ord. No. 2014-432, § 2(Exh. A), 6-23-2014)  
17.10.070 - Property maintenance. 
A.  Fire Protection. In compliance with the City of Big Bear Lake Municipal Code Title 8 (Health and Safety) Chapter 8.72 (Refuse and Weed Abatement) it shall be the duty of every owner, occupant and person in control of any land or interest therein in the city to abate there from and from all sidewalks, parkways and from any public highway or any public easement adjacent to such land, all noxious weeds or vegetation, dry grass, Russian thistle (tumbleweeds) dead trees, and all combustible rubbish or vegetation that constitutes a fire hazard, which may endanger or injure neighboring property or the health, safety or well-being of persons or property. 
B.  Tree Conservation Requirements. The following requirements shall apply to all properties within the city: 
1.  Landscaping material, which requires daily surface watering, shall not be planted within the drip line of native conifer and oak trees. Instead, plants within this area shall be drought resistant and require no more water than the native trees. If any irrigation is needed, drip irrigation shall be used. 
2.  Irrigation lines and sprinkler heads shall not be placed so as to spray on tree trunks of native conifer and oak trees. For native conifer and oak trees, irregular deep watering is encouraged, rather than daily surface watering. Every effort should be made to install irrigation trenches outside the critical root zones. Soil should only be compacted where the job engineer requires. Trenches should be backfilled as soon as possible. 
3.  No changes to the grade shall occur within the critical root zone of existing trees through construction of retaining walls, cut or fill, or other means, without plan review and approval pursuant to Sections 17.10.040 and 17.10.050 of this chapter. 
4.  No pavement shall be installed within the critical root zone of existing native trees without issuance of a plan review and approval pursuant to Sections 17.10.040 and 17.10.050(B)(2) of this chapter. 
C.  Defensible Space. It shall be the responsibility of every property owner occupant and person in control of any land interest to abate the accumulation of forest fuels around their property, through implementation of the following measures within ten (10) feet of roads and driveways, and within an area surrounding the dwelling unit(s) from zero to one hundred (100) feet in the front and rear yards, or to the property lines (whichever is less); and between the dwelling unit(s) and side property lines: 
1.  Remove all dead trees, and all combustible rubbish, burnable fuels, debris, or noxious material that constitutes a fire, health or safety hazard, or which may endanger or injure neighboring property, or the health, safety, or well-being of persons or property including but not limited to all pine needles and branches on roofs, ground debris, logs and snags, grass four inches and higher, pine needles on the ground down to a two-inch depth, and dead branches in bushes and trees. 
Exception: Grass, flammable vegetation and other combustible growth located more than thirty (30) feet from any structure and less than eighteen (18) inches in height may be maintained where necessary to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. 
2.  Cut logs or firewood greater than one cord of wood or one hundred twenty-eight (128) cubic feet shall be located ten (10) feet away from any structure or shall be covered with a fire resistive structure or fabric. Firewood should be stacked away from the drip line of trees. 
3.  Thin dense groups of young trees (less than six inches in diameter) to a six to eight foot spacing, measured trunk to trunk. Removal of any live tree with a diameter of more than twelve (12) inches measured at four and one-half feet above the ground requires approval by the city. 
4.  In areas with a continuous canopy, any tree taller than forty-five (45) feet should have its branches trimmed back to the trunk if those branches have any portion lower than twelve (12) to fifteen (15) feet from the ground. A tree shorter than forty-five (45) feet should be trimmed to remove any dead branches up one-third of its total height. For non-continuous canopy areas, tree branches shall be pruned to remove limbs located less than six feet above the ground service. A minimum vertical separation between the top of a shrub and the bottom lower branches shall be three times the height of the shrub. 
Exception: Deciduous and spruce trees more than fifteen (15) feet from any structure that have all forest litter removed from underneath the base of the tree. 
5.  Any branches that have any portions less than ten (10) feet from chimney openings shall be completely trimmed. Branches located within ten (10) feet vertical distance from the roof line that overhang a structure shall be removed. 
6.  Cut and/or thinned vegetation shall be disposed of no later than ten (10) days after cutting except that any logs infested with bark beetles shall be treated prior to removal as recommended by the California Department of Forestry, a California Registered Professional Forester or an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture. 
7.  A layer of one-quarter inch of borax powder or other approved material shall be spread on the tops of all cut pine, fir and cedar stumps within two hours of cutting, except where stumps are ground to below grade. 
8.  All pine needles and leaves shall be removed when within five feet of any structure. 
Exception: Up to two inches of dead pine needles, leaves and other soils amendments for soil replenishment and forest safety may be permitted when in the opinion of the fire chief or his/her designee they do not constitute a fire hazard. In deciding whether they present a fire hazard, the fire chief or his/her designee shall consider the proximity of the pine needles and leaves to buildings or structures.

3.  All native brush and shrubs shall be installed and maintained in a manner that minimizes fire risk, including, without limitation, by removing dead branches and twigs at all heights, modifying the lower foliage of branches, and selectively pruning to reduce the density of the plant. 
4.  Native brush and shrub shall be installed and maintained with horizontal spacing such that the space between two shrubs (horizontally) shall be a minimum of two times the height of the tallest shrub. Individual shrubs or groups of shrubs clumped together shall be modified so that their diameter does not exceed fifteen (15) feet. Groups of shrubs clumped together with a diameter of fifteen (15) feet or less shall be treated as a single plant. 
5.  Paragraphs (B), (C) and (D) of this section shall not apply to an isolated shrub or shrubs that have been heavily modified by thinning and limbing up, nor to activities within the boundaries of a plant conservation easement area, that do not, in the opinion of the fire chief, or his or her designee, constitute a fire hazard. In deciding whether such shrub or shrubs constitute a fire hazard, the fire chief, or his or her designee, shall consider (i) the proximity of the shrub(s) to other buildings or structures; (ii) the types of shrub(s) involved; (iii) the potential threat of the shrub(s) to the public health, welfare and safety; and (iv) any other factors that the fire chief, or his or her designee, deem relevant when considering the public health, safety and welfare, including, without limitation, whether such shrub(s) is endangered, rare or threatened.

B.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.020 Environmental Exemptions. The modification of brush or shrubs, as described in this chapter, shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter if any or all of the following would occur: 
1.  The activities would result in the taking of endangered, rare, or threatened plant or animal species. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the following species of plant are, as of the date of the ordinance adopting this chapter, not threatened or endangered and are subject to the provisions of this chapter: 
a.  The arctostaphylos patula species of manzanita. 
b.  The cercocarpus ledifolius species of mountain mahogany (brush form) (commonly known in Big Bear Valley as ironwood). 
c.  Sage species that occur in the Big Bear Valley. 
2.  The activities would result in significant erosion and sedimentation of surface waters. The owner of each piece of real property within the City of Big Bear Lake shall, when performing modifications required by this chapter, keep soil disturbance to a minimum, especially on steep slopes. Erosion control techniques such as leaving root balls intact, minimizing use of motorized equipment and covering exposed disturbed soil areas with mulch or similar materials shall be employed in order to help reduce soil erosion and plant re-growth. 
C.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.030 Exceptions to Ordinance. 
1.  Nurseries, and other similar agricultural and/or horticultural uses shall be exempt from Chapter 8.94, provided the fire chief, or his or her designee, shall have the discretion to enforce the provisions of this chapter with respect to such businesses as he or she deems necessary to promote the public health, safety and welfare as it relates to fire safety and/or the health of the forest. In using his or her discretion, the fire chief, or his or her designee, shall consider: (i) the health of the brush and/or shrubs involved; (ii) whether the brush and/or shrubs pose a risk to the public health, safety or welfare of the community; (iii) the type of brush and/or shrubs involved: (iv) the owner's maintenance activities involving the brush and/or shrubs; and (v) any other factors that the fire chief, or his or her designee, deem relevant when considering the public health, safety and welfare, including, without limitation, whether such shrub(s) is endangered, rare or threatened. 
2.  Up to two inches of dead pine needles, leaves and other soils amendments for soil replenishment and forest safety may be permitted when in the opinion of the fire chief or his/her designee they do not constitute a fire hazard. In deciding whether they present a fire hazard, the fire chief or his/her designee shall consider: 
a.  The proximity of the pine needles and leaves to buildings or structures; 
b.  The height of the lower branches of shrubbery from the ground (as per Section 8.94.010(C), above); 
c.  The condition of the shrubbery, (e.g., free from dead and dying limbs and leaves) (as per Section 8.94.010(C), above); 
d.  The sectioning of the shrubbery (as per Section 8.94.010(D), above); and 
e.  Any other factors that the fire chief or his/her designee deem relevant when considering the public health, safety and welfare. 
D.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.040 Certificate of Compliance Required. Upon the effective date of the ordinance adopting this chapter, the owner of the each piece of real property within the City of Big Bear Lake: (i) As a condition precedent to, the issuance of any discretionary permit or any building permit; or (ii) As a condition precedent to, the issuance of an initial private home rental license (other than the continuous renewal thereof) from the city, shall be required to obtain a "certificate of compliance" from the fire chief, or his or her designee, stating that said property is in compliance with Chapter 8.94 of the City of Big Bear Lake Municipal Code relating to native brush and shrubs. 
E.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.050 Precedence Over Other Code Provisions. The provisions of Chapter 8.94 shall supersede any conflicting provisions in the City of Big Bear Lake Municipal Code or Development Code. However, if there is a provision in the California Fire Code, as adopted by the City of Big Bear Lake, that is more stringent than the provisions in this chapter, the California Fire Code provision shall apply. 
F.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.060 Enforcement—Parcels Over Five Acres. If there is a parcel of land, or contiguous parcels under the same ownership, that comprise over five acres, native brush and/or shrubs within a forty (40) foot wide strip of land at the boundaries of the land and around any structure, shall be modified and continued to be modified in accordance with Section 8.94.010. Brush and shrub modification in the remaining land other than the forty (40) foot wide perimeter boundary is subject to the discretion of the fire chief, or his or her designee, as he or she deems necessary to promote the public health, safety and welfare as it relates to fire safety. In exercising his or her discretion, the fire chief, or his or her designee, shall consider, without limitation, the following: (i) the type of brush and/or shrubs growing on the property; (ii) the placement of the parcel in relation to other parcels; (iii) the ability of the owner to comply with the chapter's provisions; (iv) the location of the parcel, i.e., whether it is in an high fire-risk area; (v) number of past violations and/or attempts (or lack thereof) to cure such violations;; and (vi) any other factors that the fire chief, or his or her designee, deem relevant when considering the public health, safety and welfare, including, without limitation, whether such shrub(s) is endangered, rare or threatened.

_____
Name and Title of Issuing Officer 
I.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.09 Protection of Sensitive Biological Resources. 
1.  Should any owner receive a notice to abate form that mandates the modification of native brush or shrubs other than the following shrub species: juniper, Spanish broom or native brush species: manzanita, service berry, mountain whitethorn, sage, or mountain mahogany and the property falls within the potential sensitive shrub resource area (as set forth in the city's official records, and which may be amended from time to time), a sensitive plant survey will be required for the property prior to any abatement activities. If it [is] unclear whether a particular property falls within the potential sensitive shrub resource area or whether or not sensitive plant surveys are required, the owner must contact the City of Big Bear Lake Planning Department. The city's planning department shall provide requesting owners with a list of qualified surveyors, which list may be updated or revised at the discretion of the city. Ideally, sensitive plant surveys should be conducted between June and August to encompass the blooming periods of those sensitive plants that are the most difficult to detect outside the blooming period; however, the sensitive plant survey can be conducted during other parts of the year (aside from periods when snowfall is covering the ground) if necessary. Upon completion of the survey, the surveyor shall advise the owner as to any known or potential sensitive plants that should be avoided during abatement activities. A form shall be completed at the end of the survey that will provide details as to the results of the survey. The surveyor shall provide a copy of the form to the owner and the planning and fire departments. The owner shall not conduct any modification without prior written approval of the city. All surveys required by this paragraph shall be conducted within a reasonable time, as determined by the fire chief, or designee. 
2.  If any native brush modification is required for more than twenty (20) shrubs and vegetation modification activities cannot be performed outside the nesting season (typical nesting season is March 15—August 15), a nesting bird survey shall be performed less than one week prior to vegetation modification activities. Should the owner be required to conduct a nesting bird survey, he/she shall contact the City of Big Bear Lake Planning Department for a list of qualified nesting bird surveyors, which list may be updated or revised at the discretion of the city. Upon completion of the survey, the surveyor shall advise the owner as to any shrub(s) containing nesting birds that should not be modified until the completion of the nesting cycle. A form shall be completed at the end of the survey that will provide details as to the results of the survey. The surveyor shall provide a copy of the form to the owner and the planning and fire departments. The owner shall not conduct any modification without prior written approval of the city. All surveys required by this paragraph shall be conducted within a reasonable time, as determined by the fire chief, or designee. 
3.  Any owner receiving a notice to abate form (for any number of shrubs) will also receive a pamphlet pertaining to providing protection for nesting birds. The pamphlet will describe the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and suggest that if vegetation modification will occur during the nesting season (March 15—August 15), owners need to check for the presence of active bird nests and avoid modification of any vegetation containing an active bird nest (or vegetation within twenty-five (25) feet of the active bird nest) until the young have fledged. 
J.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.100 Notice to Abate—Appeal. Any owner may appeal to the fire protection district board within the time for compliance with the order, by an appeal in writing filed with the issuing officer. Timely appeal shall stay any further action until the decision on appeal is rendered. The officer receiving the written appeal shall inform the issuing officer, who shall set the matter for hearing before the fire protection district board and notify the appellant of the date set for such hearing, at least fifteen (15) days prior to such date. It the appellant resides outside the city, the above period of notice shall be at least twenty-one (21) days. The fire protection district board shall act on the appeal, and its decision shall be the final administrative decision. 
K.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.110 Appeal Procedure. 
1.  When an appellant files for an appeal pursuant to Section 8.94.100, he or she shall pay to the city clerk an appeal fee equal to the current filing fee, which may be set by resolution of the city council from time to time, as needed. 
2.  The fire protection district board shall conduct the hearing under such rules of procedure as are appropriate to quasi-judicial proceedings, provided that the appellant and the parties shall be entitled to present relevant evidence, testify under oath, and call witnesses who shall testify under oath and that the parties shall not be bound by the statutory rules of evidence in the hearing, except that hearsay evidence may not be the sole basis for the determination of the fire protection district board. The city shall have the initial burden of proof. In its discretion, the city shall cause a transcript of the hearing to be taken and prepared. 
3.  In making its determination, the fire protection district board shall consider the evidence presented by the appellant, as well as evidence presented by the fire chief, or his or her designee. The fire protection district board shall also consider the following factors, without limitation, in making its decision regarding the appeal: 
a.  The effect that the fire chief's decision will have on the overall public health, safety and welfare of the City of Big Bear Lake and the community; 
b.  The immediate danger and/or threat to the public if the fire chief's decision is not upheld; 
c.  The financial hardship to the owner should he or she be required to modify the brush and/or shrubs pursuant to this chapter; 
d.  Other adverse effects on the owner should he or she be required to modify the brush and/or shrubs pursuant to this chapter; 
e.  The owner's attempts to comply (or lack of attempts to comply) with the provisions of this chapter; 
f.  Any or all of the factors the Fire Chief considered in making his or her determination regarding the modification of the brush and/or shrubs; 
g.  Any other factors the fire protection district board deems valid in making its determination. 
L.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.120 Abatement by City—Procedure. 
1.  Except for Subsection (B), if, at the end of the time allowed for compliance in the original "notice to abate," or as extended in cases of appeal, compliance has not been accomplished, the officer issuing the notice may order native brush, as defined in Section 8.94.150(A)(2), or other shrubs to be abated by (i) public officers or employees of the city, or (ii) a private contractor selected and approved by the city manager, or his or her designee, in the manner and under the terms specified the city manager, or his or her designee. Such abatement shall be collected as a special assessment and the real property shall be subject to a special assessment lien. The amount of such lien shall be the actual cost of abatement and disposal of such material, which shall include, without limitation, the actual administrative and staff costs associated with the abatement procedures outlined in this chapter. The city council may set by resolution, from time to time, reasonable hourly rates for administrative and other costs incurred by the city implementing this chapter. 
2.  If the officer who issued the "notice to abate" finds that a substantial amount of native brush, as defined in Section 8.94.150(A)(2), or other shrubs have been abated from the land at the end of the compliance period as indicated in the "notice to abate," or as extended in the cases of appeal, the officer shall issue a second "notice to abate" in accordance with the provisions of Sections 8.94.070 and 8.94.080 prior to commencing the city-initiated abatement proceedings as described in Subsection (A); provided however that the mailed delivery method specified in Section 8.94.070(A)(1) for such second notice shall be made by a method that provides for a proof of receipt and tracking. 
M.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.130 Abatement by City—Cost Recovery. 
1.  Procedure for Payment. When said abatement has been completed, the fire chief, or his or her designee, or officer responsible for the abatement proceedings, shall render to the finance director, or his or her designee, an itemized statement covering work necessary for such abatement. The finance director, or his or her designee, shall pay the same from the general funds of the city, and by mail, the finance director, or his or her designee, shall present to the owner a demand for payment, including interest calculated at the maximum rate permitted by law. Interest will continue to accrue at such rate until the payment is received by the city. If payment is not made on behalf of the owner within sixty (60) days after mailing the bill, the finance director, or his or her designee, shall certify to the county tax collector the unpaid amount, together with the information required by law. The county tax collector shall cause the amount to be entered upon the property from which abatement was accomplished, and the special assessment and tax shall be included upon the next succeeding tax statement. Thereafter, the amounts of the assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinance municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in the case of delinquency as provided for ordinance municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to such assessment. 
2.  Appeals. Any appeal from these charges must be filed within sixty (60) days from the date of billing from the finance director or receipt of a tax bill which shows abatement charges. The appeal procedure shall be as set forth in Sections 8.94.100 and 8.94.110, and the fire protection district board's decision shall be final. Failure to appeal shall constitute a waiver of any and all claims. 
3.  Cancellation of Claim. All or any portion of any such special assessment, penalty, or costs entered, shall on order of the fire protection district board be cancelled by the finance director, or his or her designee, if uncollected, or, except in the case provided for in Subsection (C)(5), refunded by the country treasurer if collected, if it or they were entered, charged or paid: 
a.  More than once; 
b.  Through clerical error; 
c.  Through the error or mistake of the fire protection district board or of the officer, board or commission designated by the fire protection district board to give notice or to destroy the brush or shrubs, in respect to any material fact, including where a cost report erroneously shows that the city abated the brush or shrubs; 
d.  Illegally; or 
e.  On property acquired after the lien date by the state or by any county, city, school district or other political subdivision, and because of this public ownership, not subject to sale for delinquent taxes. 
4.  Procedure for Refund of Payment. No order for a refund under this section shall be made except on a claim: 
a.  Verified by the person who paid the special assessment, or his or her guardian, executor, or administrator, or 
b.  Filed within three years after making the payment sought to be refunded. The provisions of this section do not apply to cancellations. 
N.  Municipal Code Section 8.94.140 Authorization for Fee for Service. The city council may establish by resolution, from time to time, fees for service to recover up to, but no more than, one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of the administering this chapter, which shall include, without limitation, the actual administrative and staff costs associated with the inspection and the abatement procedures outlined in this chapter. The fee shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee is charged.

(Ord. No. 2014-432, § 2(Exh. A), 6-23-2014)  
17.10.080 - Defensible space development standards for new subdivisions of land. 
A.  Scope. Each proposed residential tentative parcel map or tentative tract map in which an application is deemed complete by the city planner within two years after the effective date of this chapter (with the exception of one-lot condominium subdivisions) shall comply with all applicable requirements of this chapter. 
B.  Residential Density. In order to reduce fire hazards, prevent erosion, and to preserve the existing vegetation and visual quality, the density of development for any tentative parcel map or tentative tract map (with the exception of one-lot subdivisions) in sloping hillside areas shall be in compliance with the following criteria: 
1.  One to four dwelling units per gross acre on slopes of zero to less than fifteen percent (0 - <15%); 
2.  Two dwelling units per gross acre on slopes of fifteen to less than thirty percent (15 - <30%); 
3.  One dwelling unit per three gross acres on slopes of greater than thirty to less than forty percent (30 - 40%) gradient; 
4.  One dwelling unit per ten (10) gross acres on slopes of forty percent (40%) or greater gradient; 
C.  Site and Emergency Access. 
1.  Emergency Access. Each development project and each development project phase, except for a development project located exclusively on a cul-de-sac, shall have a minimum of two points of vehicular ingress and egress, designed to county road standards, with a minimum width of twenty-six (26) feet of all-weather surface as defined in the uniform fire code, from existing and surrounding streets. The department may authorize one point of vehicular access to be an emergency access route with an all-weather surface if the department first makes each of the following findings: 
a.  Two points of nonemergency access are physically infeasible; 
b.  Provisions have been made to reasonably ensure that the emergency access will be maintained; and 
c.  Based on the review and consideration of the fire authority's recommendation, the emergency access route will provide adequate vehicular ingress and egress during emergencies. 
2.  Private Driveways or Access Roadways. Private driveways or access roadways for residential units shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150) feet in length, unless approved by the fire authority. 
D.  Water Supply. Each development project shall provide six-inch or larger circulating (loop) water mains as required by the uniform fire code, proper hydrant location and spacing, and have sufficient water storage capacity to provide the minimum fire flow duration requirements [gallons per minute (GPM) for a minimum number of hours or portions thereof] as specified by the minimum system standards established by the fire authority. Circulating (loop) mains are not required for cul-de-sacs and are not required for subdivisions that exclusively take all access from cul-de-sacs. In areas not served by water purveyors, on-site fire flow and water storage requirements shall be as specified by the uniform fire code. 
E.  Access to Water Supplies. There shall be vehicular access, at least twelve (12) feet in width, to within at least ten (10) feet of each static water source, including ponds, lakes, swimming pools, reservoirs and water storage tanks. Access shall be either to a plumbed outlet with two-and-one-half-inch National Hose Thread Fitting, or directly to the source. This requirement shall be waived if the fire authority determines that the water source is sufficiently below the elevation of existing or proposed roads or driveways to make drafting of water from the source through a plumbed outlet infeasible, and that direct vehicular access to the water source would require an impractical extension of a road or driveway. 
F.  Fuel Modification Areas. 
1.  A permanent fuel modification area shall be required around a development project or portions thereof that are adjacent or exposed to hazardous fire areas for the purpose of fire protection. In no case shall this area be less than one hundred (100) feet in width as measured from the development perimeter. Where feasible, the area shall be designated as common open space rather than private open space. The recommended width of the fuel modification area shall be determined based on a fuel modification plan. 
2.  When a development project is phased, individual phases may be required to provide temporary fuel modification areas, where the development perimeter of a phase is contiguous to a subsequent phase of a project, which in its undeveloped state is a hazardous fire area. The need for a temporary fuel modification area shall be determined by the responsible fire authority and shall be based upon the same considerations described in Subdivision (A), above, for permanent fuel modification areas and the factors addressed in the required fuel modification plan. 
G.  National Forest Boundary. Each structure on a lot that was created on or after the effective date of this chapter that abuts a boundary of the San Bernardino National Forest shall be set back at least one hundred (100) feet from the boundary. 
H.  Sloping Site Setbacks and Fuel Modification. Each structure proposed in an area with slopes exceeding thirty percent (30%) and thirty (30) feet in height shall comply with the following requirements: 
1.  Where a structure is proposed on or within two hundred (200) feet of a slope that is greater than thirty percent (30%) before grading and where the slope is at least thirty (30) feet in height, the vegetation on the slopes shall be treated in a manner so that it becomes a fuel modified area. The fuel-modified area shall be maintained for either the entire slope, or one hundred (100) feet, or to the property line, whichever distance is less for existing parcels or the distance prescribed by a fuel modification plan for new development. 
2.  Where grading is utilized that does not conform to the natural slope and the graded area is adjacent to natural ungraded slopes that are greater than thirty percent (30%) in gradient and greater than thirty (30) feet in height, each structure shall be set back at least thirty (30) feet from the edges of the graded area adjacent to the natural ungraded slopes. 
I.  Street Name Signs. All public or private streets within or bordering a development project shall have noncombustible and reflective street name signs designed to city standards and visible at all street intersections. 
J.  Fire Hydrant Identification. Each fire hydrant shall be identified by a method specified by the fire authority. 
K.  Erosion and Sediment Control. Each development project, building permit, grading and any other significant land disturbing activity shall include the installation of erosion control measures in compliance with this Development Code and the requirements of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). 
L.  Building Separation Standards for New Subdivisions. To reduce the exposure and risk from adjacent structural fires and to reduce the potential spread of fire from structure to structure each building on a parcel shall have exterior wall separations of at least thirty (30) feet including those on adjoining parcels except as modified by Subdivision (1) below. Eaves shall be permitted to project into the required setback no more than two feet. No other projections shall be allowed less than five feet to side or rear property lines. 
1.  When the exterior walls of accessory buildings not exempt from the California Building Codes or portions thereof are proposed within fifteen (15) feet of interior side lot line, or the exterior wall separation from another structure is less than thirty (30) feet, the outside of each exterior wall or portion thereof shall be constructed with exterior wall coverings that are constructed of noncombustible materials or provide the one-hour fire-resistance-rated construction on the exterior side. Modified one-hour construction shall be approved by the building official. In no case shall exterior wall separations be less than ten (10) feet for all buildings, 
M.  Perimeter Access to Fuel Modified and Fire Hazard Areas Adjacent to the National Forest. Fire fighting vehicles shall have adequate access into fuel modified areas of the development perimeter that are adjacent to the National Forest, so that a wildland fire can be contained at the development perimeter and prevented from spreading to structures. Each development project shall provide adequate vehicular access for fire fighting vehicles to the development perimeter of the project along the portion of the development perimeter that is adjacent to either an existing or proposed fuel modified area, a fire hazard area or the National Forest. Provisions shall be made and shall be required, where necessary, through conditions of approval for the development project for the continual maintenance of the areas intended to provide the access. Perimeter access shall be provided, through either of the following measures or through alternate measures as approved by the building official. 
1.  The provision of an existing or proposed road along the development perimeter, or portion thereof that is exposed to a fire hazard or fuel modified area, and which is accessible to fire fighting equipment. The road shall be capable of supporting fire-fighting equipment, shall be at least twenty (20) feet in width, and shall not exceed a grade of fourteen percent (14%). The conditions of approval for the development project shall require provisions to ensure that the roadway will be maintained, if it is not within the publicly maintained road system. 
2.  Development projects shall provide access ways, at least twelve (12) feet in width, with a grade not to exceed fourteen percent (14%), and capable of supporting fire fighting vehicles, between the development perimeter and proposed or existing streets. Access ways shall be spaced at intervals of no more than an average of three hundred fifty (350) feet along each street. The conditions of approval for the development project shall require specific provisions to ensure that access ways will remain unobstructed and will be maintained. Where feasible, access ways may not be paved and shall be designed so as not to detract from the visual quality of the project. 
N.  Length of Cul-De-Sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed three hundred fifty (350) feet in length and have turn around or hammerhead per the California Fire Code Part 9, Appendix Chapter D. 
1.  Limitation of the total number of dwelling units with access to the cul-de-sac shall be limited to no more than fifteen (15), and restriction of further subdivision of parcels and construction of additional independent residential units which have access to the cul-de-sac. These restrictions shall be imposed through conditions of approval of the development project. 
2.  The cul-de-sac road will have a paved width of at least forty (40) feet with posted no parking for its entire length, and there is at least one area approximately at the midpoint of the cul-de-sac that serves the same function of a cul-de-sac bulb in allowing fire fighting vehicles adequate room to turn around. This measure may only be utilized if the expansion of the road width will not contribute to slope stability hazards either on-site or off-site. 
(Ord. No. 2014-432, § 2(Exh. A), 6-23-2014)  
17.10.085 - Appeals.

Chapter 17.11 - WATER CONSERVATION 
Sections: 
 
17.11.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide water conservation measures in order to minimize the effect(s) of a water shortage on the citizens of, visitors to, and the economic well-being of the city and, by means of this chapter, to adopt provisions that will significantly reduce the wasteful and inefficient consumption of water over an extended period of time, thereby extending the available water resources required for the domestic, sanitation and fire protection needs of the citizens of, and visitors to, the city, while reducing the hardship of the city and the general public to the greatest extent possible. 
(Ord. 87-151 § 1, 1987)  
17.11.020 - Policy, objectives and goals. 
It is declared that, because of the conditions prevailing in the city of Big Bear Lake and areas elsewhere from which the city of Big Bear Lake obtains its water supplies, the general welfare requires that the water resources available to the city be put to the maximum beneficial use to the extent to which they are capable and that the wasteful, inefficient or unreasonable use or method of use of our limited and finite water resources be prevented. As such, the conservation of such waters is to be exercised with a view to the reasonable and beneficial and efficient use thereof, in the interests of the people of the city and for the public welfare. Therefore, the city of Big Bear Lake declares and establishes the following goals, objectives and policies pertaining to the conservation and use of water: 
A.  Goals. 
1.  The conservation of water; 
2.  The efficient use and distribution of available water supplies; 
3.  Adequate and sufficient potable water supply and availability for the greatest public benefit, with particular regard to human consumption, sanitation and fire protection. 
B.  Objectives. 
1.  To conserve available water supplies; 
2.  To achieve an overall water use reduction; 
3.  To reduce the volume of wasted water; 
4.  To reduce the demand for water and thus to slow down the need for new capital facilities; 
5.  To continuously increase consumer awareness about the need for, and benefits of, water conservation; 
6.  To reduce or eliminate wasteful and inefficient uses of water; 
7.  To assure an adequate supply of potable water sufficient to meet the essential private and public needs of the city's growing population and economy; 
8.  To minimize leakage of water from the distribution system; 
9.  To assure that all new developments and that existing developments which are resold, remodeled or added to are equipped with water-conserving devices, fixtures and appliances; 
10.  To increase the use of native or water-conserving plant species for landscaping purposes; 
11.  To assure that development occurring on identified groundwater recharge areas maintains or enhances the site's natural water recharge characteristics and attributes. 
C.  Policies. 
1.  All new structures shall be (re)equipped with low-flush toilets, as per Section 17921.3 of the California Health and Safety Code, and with low-flow showers and faucets, as per Title 24, Part 6, Article 1, T20-1406F of the California Administrative Code, in addition to the insulating of all hot water lines, according to California Energy Commission regulations; 
2.  Prior to project approval, guarantee of an adequate supply of potable water sufficient to meet essential private and domestic, sanitation and fire protection needs for the entire city of Big Bear Lake shall be provided by the local water purveyor or appropriate state agency; 
3.  The use of native or water conserving plant species for landscaping purposes is suggested; 
4.  The use of lawns shall be minimized in commercial, hotel, condominium and large-scale housing and shall be subject to planning commission review and conditioning of projects; 
5.  Leakage of water from storage reservoirs and the distribution system shall be significantly reduced or eliminated; 
6.  Cooperate with local water purveyors, appropriate state and other responsible agencies in facilitating a continuous program to increase consumer awareness about the need for and benefits of water conservation; 
7.  Increase the efficiency of existing, and facilitate the construction of new, water storage reservoirs; 
8.  Require new developments to pay a fair share contribution toward the construction of new water storage reservoirs identified as being needed; 
9.  Encourage large water users to implement water recycling and reuse processes; 
10.  Make water conservation as reliable a method in reducing water demands as water supply projects are in meeting such demands; 
11.  Encourage large water users to submit a water conservation plan to the office of the general manager of the department of water and power and promote implementation of same; 
12.  All city departments shall submit to the office of the general manager of the department of water and power a quarterly public report on their water conservation efforts; 
13.  Water demand, use and mitigation shall be addresses in every environmental impact report. 
(Ord. 89-178 § 1(part), 1989; Ord. 87-151 § 3, 1987)  
17.11.030 - Applicability. 
A.

In addition to the objectives expressed in the general plan, this chapter is intended to achieve the following objectives: 
A.  To promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare by regulating the design, quality of materials, and construction, illumination, location, number, and maintenance of all signs and sign structures; 
B.  To ensure that signs help to index the environment by directing people to their destination in a clear and understandable manner which helps and does not distract motorists; 
C.  To help create a sense of place for Big Bear Lake, in keeping with the natural mountain environment, by ensuring that signs are compatible with and enhance the quality of their surroundings; 
D.  To allow free expression and individuality by business owners, in keeping with the city's design policies, and protect the right to free speech afforded by the United States Constitution; 
E.  To ensure that signs are visible, legible, readable in the circumstances in which they are seen, orderly, free of hazards, in good repair, and conserving of energy; 
F.  To protect the city from the blighting influence of excessive, poorly designed or unmaintained signs, so as to preserve and enhance the economic base of the city and safeguard property values; 
G.  To assure that signs are appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain; 
H.  To establish a process for the identification and abatement of illegal, abandoned, and improperly maintained signs; and 
I.  To establish sign regulations that encourage compliance and that can be economically enforced.

It shall be presumed, as to signs for political candidates, that the political candidate or his or her representative is the party who erected the sign. It shall further be presumed that the committee who has registered with the Secretary of State to support a position on a ballot proposition is the party who erected the sign taking the position on the ballot measure.

(Ord. 2000-310 § 2(part), 2000) 
(Ord. No. 2011-415, § 4(Exh. 1), 8-22-2011)  
17.12.060 - Prohibited signs. 
The following signs are prohibited: 
A.  Any sign not expressly permitted is prohibited, except as specifically authorized by planning commission interpretation based upon finding that such sign complies with the general plan, including Policy CD 7.4 of the Community Design Element, and that the sign meets the intent of this ordinance as stated in Section 17.12.010. 
B.  Architectural or structural features shaped like a product, service or business which exceeds the size and location limitations of this chapter. 
C.  Animated signs, with the exception of historical signs and portions of a sign containing non-commercial speech or decorative features. 
D.  Banners, including feather banners, except as specifically allowed in this chapter. Refer to Section 17.12.050 (Exempt Signs) for temporary non-commercial signs and Section 17.12.150 (Temporary Signs) for temporary use and special event signs. 
E.  Dynamic electronic changeable copy signs. 
F.  Flashing signs (except time and temperature signs). 
G.  Human signs (except in conjunction with a special event pursuant to Section 17.12.150). 
H.  Outdoor advertising sign structures (billboards). With respect to the prohibition of outdoor advertising sign structures, the city council finds as follows: 
1.  As stated in the General Plan Community Design Element, "the City's appearance is a major component of its viability as a visitor-oriented destination resort, and aesthetically-pleasing roadways and business districts are key to maintaining and enhancing the local economy. Therefore, some level of sign control is determined to be necessary for economic as well as aesthetic reasons." 
2.  Policy CD 7.4 in the General Plan Community Design Element states that signs should "enhance, rather than detract from, the natural environment and distinctive mountain architecture." 
3.  Policy CD 2.2 in the General Plan Community Design Element requires, in part, that the city "protect and enhance significant views, where appropriate, through the following measures: a. prohibit the erection of any new billboard within the City." 
4.  Based upon the adopted general plan policies and findings, the city council determines that the prohibition of offsite advertising sign structures within the city conforms to the community's objectives as stated in the general plan to maintain views and enhance the scenic qualities of roadways, in order to preserve the city's natural beauty as well as to sustain tourism to support the local economy. Moreover, the city council finds that the prohibition of off-site advertising sign structures does not significantly reduce opportunities for non-commercial advertising because alternative avenues for communication of non-commercial messages have been provided. 
I.  Portable freestanding signs, except as specifically allowed in this chapter. Refer to Section 17.12.050 (Exempt Signs) for temporary non-commercial signs and Section 17.12.150 (Temporary Signs) for temporary use and special event signs.

The following general provisions are applicable to all signs regulated by this chapter. These general provisions apply in addition to any specific regulations in this chapter. 
A.  Calculation. 
1.  For wall signs, permitted area for any sign shall be calculated based only on the frontage or side of a building on which the sign is located. 
2.  Maximum permitted sign area shall be based on the use of the building or property. When more than one business is located in a building, the allowable sign area for each business shall be based upon the lineal frontage occupied by that business. 
B.  Construction. Every sign and all parts, portions, units, and materials comprising the same, together with the frame, background, supports, or anchorage therefore, shall be manufactured, fabricated, assembled, constructed, and erected in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and city laws and regulations. Any person or entity engaged in the business of constructing signs in the city shall have a valid state contractor's license and a city business license, where applicable. No person shall erect, construct or install a sign or cause such sign to be erected, constructed or installed without having first obtained all required permits and licenses. 
C.  Maintenance. The following maintenance standards shall apply to all signs: 
1.  Every sign and all parts, portions, units and materials comprising the same, together with the frame, background, supports, or anchorage thereof, shall be continuously maintained in a safe, structurally sound, neatly painted, and well-repaired condition. 
2.  Signs illuminated either internally or externally must be capable of being fully illuminated and legible and the face(s) must be intact without holes or other exterior facial damage. 
3.  Illuminated signs that are damaged or have defective lighting elements shall remain unlighted until repaired. 
4.  In the case of abandoned signs, any message or copy pertaining to the abandoned business must be removed and replaced with a blank panel within ninety-one (91) days of user vacancy. 
5.  Under no circumstances shall sign cabinets remain empty for periods exceeding ninety (90) days. 
6.  No person shall maintain or permit to be maintained on any premises owned or controlled by him/her any sign which is in a dangerous or defective condition. Any such sign shall be promptly removed or repaired by the owner of the sign or the owner of the premises upon notification by the city planner. 
D.  Obstruction of Public Passage. No sign may be constructed so as to obstruct any required exit, including windows, doors, fire escapes or other emergency exit of any building.

(Ord. 2000-310 § 2(part), 2000) 
(Ord. No. 2011-415, § 4(Exh. 1), 8-22-2011)  
17.12.080 - Design standards for signs. 
In addition to the guidelines contained in the Community Design Element of the general plan, the following design standards shall apply to all signs in the City of Big Bear Lake. 
A.  Incentives. The purpose of incentives is to encourage innovative freestanding signs, which by their quality of materials and craftsmanship distinctly enhance the mountain aesthetic of the community. Signs which qualify for incentives require city planner approval of a sign permit, or a sign program if applicable. 
1.  Design Criteria. The signs shall incorporate a minimum of three of the following features: 
a.  Posts or base and trim constructed of heavy timber logs or rough sawn lumber of six-inch nominal dimension or greater; 
b.  Three-dimensional carved, routed, sand-blasted, or lasercut letters, numbers, or pictorial graphics; 
c.  Trim or base constructed of natural or cultured stone; 
d.  A minimum of one statue or sculptural feature consisting of indigenous animals that are natural in appearance and three-dimensional, and measuring a minimum of four feet in height; 
e.  The sign, and statue or sculptural feature if applicable, shall be located in a planter or landscaped area which shall measure a minimum of two feet from the leading edges of the sign and shall surround the sign on a minimum of three sides. The planter or landscape area shall be part of the site's streetscape along the street frontage. The planter or landscape area may include a mix of xeriscape plants and trees, and/or natural features such as stones, boulders, or logs. Any fencing in this area shall be constructed of wood or stone and shall comply with height and setback requirements. 
 
Figure 22: Minimum
 Landscaped Area
2.  Maximum Allowances. Signs that incorporate a minimum of three of the items listed in paragraph 1 of this section, above, may be granted a ten percent (10%) increase to the existing sign area. Signs that incorporate a minimum of four items listed in the paragraph 1 may be granted a fifteen percent (15%) increase to the existing sign area. Signs that incorporate all five items listed in the paragraph 1 may be granted a twenty percent (20%) increase to the existing sign area. The increase in sign face shall be proportional to the remaining sign area and all signs will remain subject to maximum height and width dimensions as provided herein. 
a.  Signs that are primarily constructed of energy efficient and environmentally friendly features in the areas of materials (re-used or recycled content; regional, renewable, or certified materials), finishes (low-emitting paintings and coatings), and lighting (LED or solar-powered) may be granted a five percent increase to the existing sign area. The checklists identified in Municipal Code Chapter 15.39 (Green Building) may be used in determining appropriate green features. The total incentives shall not increase the sign face by more than twenty-five percent (25%). 
3.  Limitations. 
a.  A business which receives a sign incentive shall not be eligible for a sign permit for a portable freestanding sign and such existing signs on the site shall be removed upon approval of sign incentives. 
b.  Businesses that receive sign incentives shall have no violations of the Municipal Code existing on the property. 
B.  Quality of Workmanship and Materials. Signs shall be of a quality commensurate with professional design standards and shall be constructed of durable materials which withstand the elements. No signs made out of paper, cardboard, cloth, plastic sheeting, or other non-durable materials shall be permitted, except as expressly allowed by Section 17.12.150 (Temporary Signs). Lettering, logos and other sign content shall be professionally prepared and shall appear uniform and legible. 
C.  Incorporation of Decoration. Only seventy-five percent (75%) of the total sign face may contain sign copy; the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of the sign face shall be decorative in nature, which may include but not be limited to background enhancement such as color or pictorial graphics, use of decorative trim, or other similar means of enhancing the appearance of the sign face. Due to the nature of channel letter signs, incorporation of decoration may include color, decorative font style, or background materials on which the sign is placed upon. 
D.  Materials. With the exception of channel letter signs, signs shall incorporate natural materials which reflect and complement the mountain environment, including wood, rock or stone, decorative ironwork, or a combination of these materials. All poles shall be encased in a decorative material; no bare metal support poles shall be allowed. At least one decorative material shall be incorporated into the sign design, which may include the base, supports, frame, sign face, or trim of the sign. Materials not in keeping with the mountain environment, such as stucco, red tile, or highly reflective materials, shall require approval by the city planner. Materials shall be consistent with and complementary to the materials used in the primary structures on the site. 
E.  Design Theme. Each sign shall incorporate at least one design element which reflects a mountain design theme, such as a peaked roof feature, decorative posts or base, decorative wood, stone, rock, or log trim, wood or wood-appearing beams, sculpture, painting, or other such feature. Design theme shall be consistent with and complementary to the design theme used in the primary structures on the site. 
F.  Sign Frame. Freestanding sign structures, such as monument or pole signs, shall provide an additional area, measuring at minimum twenty-five percent (25%) of the sign face, for a sign frame to surround the sign face. The frame shall be constructed of wood, logs, or rock materials, or materials which complement the existing primary structures on the site. The frame shall be three-dimensional and natural in appearance when faux materials are used. 
G.  Colors. The colors used on the base, frame and support structure of signs shall be consistent with and complementary to the colors of the building(s) on the project site. Fluorescent and "day-glow" colors will not be allowed on permanent sign structures, faces or copy. 
H.  Sign Illumination Intensity. The sign permittee shall be required to adjust a sign's illumination level such that it can be determined to be non-excessive as a result of the city planner's evaluation. Illumination shall be considered excessive if it is substantially greater than the illumination of other nearby signs, if it interferes with the visibility of other signs or with the perception of objects or buildings in the vicinity of the sign, if it directs glare toward streets or motorists, if it adversely impacts nearby residences or neighborhoods, or if the illumination reduces the nighttime readability of the sign. Adjustment could include shielding, placement or location of lighting devices, or other similar means. No permit for an illuminated sign shall become valid unless and until the sign's illumination level has been adjusted to the satisfaction of the city planner. The use of energy efficient lighting features, such as solar-powered or light-emitting diodes (LED), are encouraged for signs that are illuminated. 
I.  Legibility. Sign lettering shall be of a size, font and spacing so as to be legible in the circumstances in which it is seen. The sign face should show adequate contrast between letters and the background color. Use of condensed capital letters is discouraged in favor of lower case letters with initial letters capitalized. Use of a font with seraphs and varying letter thickness is encouraged, for legibility. 
J.  Location. Signs shall not block the view from the street of existing signs on adjacent properties. Sign location and size shall be compatible with and in proportion to the structure or premises to which it is to be affixed. Sign location shall not impede pedestrian access or impair vehicle sight distance at driveways and intersections. 
K.  Landscaping. Landscaping or a planter shall be incorporated around the base of all freestanding signs. Planter or landscaped area shall not be less than ten (10) square feet in area. Where feasible, live plant materials and appropriate irrigation as necessary shall be provided within the landscaping area or planter, and shall include evergreen plant material for year-round greenery. Where live planting is not feasible, decorative hardscape shall be provided, such as decorative rock, bricks, pavers, or other similar material. Landscaping shall be maintained in good condition on an on-going basis. 
L.  Individuality. Signs are expressive of the individual business owner's identity and appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain. It is recognized that commercial, retail, office, services, entertainment, industrial and institutional uses will each demonstrate a different sign character, and that individual expression will further modify sign designs. Such variation is allowed, provided that sign design meets applicable standards as contained in this ordinance. 
M.  Compatibility. Signs shall be compatible with the visual character of the surrounding area. Signs near residential areas shall be less visually obtrusive than those in commercial areas. Signs in historic or scenic areas shall not distract from the character of these areas.

If permit applications for more than one event scheduled for the same or overlapping dates are received concurrently, equal consideration shall be given to all applications and the city planner may divide the number of banners equally among the applicants and/or approve placing banners for one event on Village Drive and another on Pine Knot Avenue. Priority and special consideration may be given to events that take place within and generally benefit the village specific plan area provided that the city planner is notified at least 90 days prior to the installation date of special event banners. 
c.  Banners shall be installed and removed only by the public works department except as otherwise approved by the city. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the installation date, the applicant shall contact the public works maintenance manager/superintendent to schedule city maintenance staff time for installation and removal of the banners. 
d.  The applicant shall pay the actual costs to the city of banner installation and removal, unless said charges are waived by the city council or the event is co-sponsored by the city. These costs shall include, without limitation, the removal of 1-92 banners, installation and removal of special event banners and reinstallation of 1-92 banners. Such costs also include, without limitation, repair of mounting brackets and installation of hardware, and traffic control during installation and removal. The city council may from time to time, by resolution, adopt fees to be paid to the city related to the matters set forth herein. Such fees may be changed from time to time, by resolution of the city council, and all such fees shall be paid by the applicant to the city prior to the installation of any banner.

17.12.140 - Business directional signs. 
Business directional signs, which direct attention to a business, function, or establishment and that are erected at a location other than the property on which that business, function, or establishment is located, shall be permitted for businesses which are located within the City of Big Bear Lake, pursuant to the provisions of this section. It is the intent of the city council, in allowing such signs, to provide for public safety by directing traffic off of State Highway 18 at appropriate locations so as to minimize traffic congestion. In addition, it is the intent of the city council to provide for the convenience of visitors to the city who are seeking recreational facilities and other attractions, thereby providing for an enjoyable experience by visitors, promoting the visitor-oriented facilities in the city, and contributing to the economic viability of city businesses. As such, business directional signs may contain copy indicating the name and type of business, and a directional symbol or wording; such signs shall not contain advertising information, because such additional information could obscure traffic directional information. 
A.  Number Permitted. The number permitted per business located within the City of Big Bear Lake shall be as follows: 
1.  Except as provided in paragraph 2 below for winter ski and snowboard resorts, marinas, golf courses, and other public recreational venues, one such sign may be located on primary or secondary arterials as identified in the General Plan Circulation Element, provided that the business shown on the directional sign is not located on Big Bear Boulevard; and 
2.  Winter ski and snowboard resorts, marinas and golf courses may each be allowed two off-site business directional signs, provided that the business shown on the directional sign is not located on Big Bear Boulevard. 
B.  Sign Location and Size. 
1.  A business directional sign shall be approved only where the existing site signs comply with the current sign provisions of this chapter. 
2.  Signs shall be attached to an existing freestanding sign. When an existing freestanding sign is not available, sign location and type shall be determined by the land use district in which the sign is proposed to be located and shall be subject to planning commission review and approval. 
3.  Except as provided in paragraph 5 below for winter ski and snowboard resorts, marinas and golf courses, sign area shall not exceed twelve (12) square feet per directional sign. 
4.  Total cumulative sign area on the site or building displaying the business directional sign shall be in addition to that which is otherwise permitted for that site or building by this chapter. 
5.  Maximum sign area for directional signs for winter ski and snowboard resorts, marinas golf courses, and other public recreational venues shall not exceed thirty-six (36) square feet, which shall be calculated in addition to the total sign area allowed on the parcel on which such sign is placed. 
6.  The business directional sign area shall be only associated with the subject parcel located off Big Bear Boulevard. The area for the business directional sign shall not be used by any other on-site business. 
C.  Property Owner Authorization. Permission from the owner of the property where business directional signs are located shall be submitted to the city planner, along with the sign permit application.

(Ord. No. 2011-415, § 4(Exh. 1), 8-22-2011)  
17.12.150 - Temporary signs. 
A.  Temporary Use and Special Event Signs. 
1.  Signs to identify locations of temporary uses and special events may be permitted as part of the approval of a temporary use permit or special event permit, without additional sign permits, provided that they meet the requirements of this section.

Temporary uses include but may not be limited to seasonal activities such as holiday tree sales, sales of pumpkins, and haunted houses during limited seasonal periods. Major special events include but are not limited to circuses, carnivals, festivals, outdoor concerts, bicycle races, marathons, car shows, and other activities similar in scope and nature. Minor special events include but are not limited to yard sales, parking lot sales, small-scale arts and crafts sales, bake sales, grand openings, and car washes. 
2.  Signs for minor special events and temporary uses shall be limited to one per use and shall be located on-site. Signs for major special events shall not exceed six per event and may be located on- or off-site, with proof of property owner permission. The sign area and height shall be the same as for temporary noncommercial signs; maximum size of the sign shall not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet and the top of the sign shall not be placed higher than eight feet above grade.

B.  Transit-Related Temporary Signs. 
1.  Transit-related temporary signs shall be allowed for the purpose of advertising products, services, goods, attractions, or events. These signs may be affixed to a coach, shelter, bench or other appurtenant facility owned or used by the coach company or agency. For the purposes of this section, the term "coach" shall mean any motor bus, trackless trolley, passenger stage, shuttle, coach, cap, carriage, or other similar mode of transportation.

2.  Such signs shall not interfere with nor impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic or circulation. 
C.  Temporary Commercial Signs. 
1.  New Business Sign. New businesses or a business with a change of ownership may be permitted to have a temporary sign for a duration not to exceed up to thirty (30) consecutive days while processing a sign review application for a permanent sign. Such temporary sign may be a wall sign or banner. The size, location, and placement of such signs shall not exceed the restrictions of this chapter for permanent signs. Extensions of time may be authorized by the city planner, not to exceed fifteen (15) additional days, in the event that the permanent sign installation is delayed. 
(Ord. 2002-318 § 2(part), 2002; Ord. 2000-310 § 2(part), 2000) 
(Ord. No. 2011-415, § 4(Exh. 1), 8-22-2011)  
17.12.160 - Variance procedures. 
A.  Approval Authority. The city planner or his/her designee may grant a minor deviation (minor variance), with planning commission approval, from the regulations pertaining to signs. All other requests to deviate from the sign regulations in this chapter shall be reviewed by the planning commission as a major deviation (variance), at a duly-noticed public hearing. 
B.  Application. In addition to an application for a sign permit and/or sign program, as applicable, the applicant shall submit an application for a minor or major deviation with the city planner, on the form provided and accompanied by the required fee. The applicant shall have the burden of proving that the requested deviation is in conformance with the required findings. 
C.  Findings for Approval. Prior to approval of a minor or major deviation for a sign, the reviewing authority shall make the following findings, as applicable: 
1.  The building or property on which the sign is to be located is subject to extraordinary or exceptional circumstances or hardship conditions that are not applicable to other properties or buildings within the same district. Exceptional circumstances or hardship conditions include: steep topography, trees, rock outcroppings, odd-shaped lots, substandard lots, natural drainage courses and similar existing conditions. For purposes of meeting this finding, economic reasons are not considered an exceptional or extraordinary circumstance or hardship condition. 
2.  The size will not be detrimental to surrounding uses or properties or the community in general; 
3.  The approval of the deviation/variance complies with the general plan and the applicable previous of this chapter; and 
4.  The strict application of the Development Code and this chapter would prevent the property or business owner from enjoying the same privileges enjoyed by other owners within the same district. 
(Ord. 2000-310 § 2(part), 2000) 
(Ord. No. 2011-415, § 4(Exh. 1), 8-22-2011)  
17.12.170 - Nonconforming signs. 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this section to encourage and promote compliance of existing signs with the provisions of this chapter and the eventual elimination of nonconforming signs. The achievement of full compliance of all signs with the provisions of this chapter is as important as the prohibition of new signs that would violate these regulations. If the sign is one defined by the Outdoor Advertising Act, Section 5499.1, it shall be abated following notice and hearing procedures required by Section 5499.1 et seq. of the Business and Professions Code. 
B.  Legal Nonconforming Signs. Every on-site sign becoming nonconforming as a result of this article shall not be required to be removed, except as provided for in California Business and Professions Code Sections 5492, 5493, 5495, and 5497. An existing sign which was constructed in accordance with the ordinances and other applicable laws in effect on the date of construction and which has a current and valid sign permit but becomes nonconforming by adoption of this chapter or other regulation will be allowed to remain within the amortization period unless any of the following occurs: 
1.  The sign structure is altered which makes the sign less in compliance with the requirement of this chapter than it was before the alteration; or 
2.  The sign structure is relocated to a different location on the site or lot, making it less in compliance with the requirements of this chapter; or 
3.  The sign or sign structure is replaced (excluding change of copy). 
On the happening of any one of [subsection] 1, 2, or 3 of this section, the sign shall be immediately brought into compliance with this chapter with a new permit secured. 
C.  Eminent Domain. Any sign that becomes subject to eminent domain proceedings shall be considered eligible for relocation assistance only, as provided in Section 72620 et seq. of the Government Code. 
D.  Repair and Restoration of Nonconforming Structures. Maintenance, repair, and alterations of nonconforming signs that are not historic remain subject to Development Code Section 17.03.320.I, which states that no structural alteration shall be made if the expense of the restoration exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost of the structure at the time the construction is proposed. 
(Ord. 2000-310 § 2(part), 2000) 
(Ord. No. 2011-415, § 4(Exh. 1), 8-22-2011)  
17.12.180 - Enforcement. 
A.  Any violations of this chapter shall be subject to the enforcement remedies and penalties provided by this chapter, the Big Bear Lake Development Code, Big Bear Lake Municipal Code, and by state and federal law. Each sign and each day is subject to separate infraction violations when applying penalties. It shall be an infraction to install, erect, fail to remove, or maintain any sign without a permit, as required by this chapter. It shall also be a violation to install, erect, fail to remove, or maintain any sign in violation of this chapter. Enforcement may be pursued by issuance of infraction citations, nuisance abatement, injunction, or other remedies available by law. All such penalties may be cumulative. 
(Ord. 2000-310 § 2(part), 2000) 
(Ord. No. 2011-415, § 4(Exh. 1), 8-22-2011)  
17.12.190 - Abatement of illegal and unsafe signs. 
A.  Nuisance Abatement. Signs not in compliance with this chapter may be declared to be a public nuisance, and be abated in accordance with the requirements of the Big Bear Lake Municipal Code. 
B.  Abatement. Signs located in the public right-of-way or signs which are not in compliance with this chapter may be declared to be a de facto public nuisance subject to abatement by the enforcement officer. In addition to any criminal or civil penalties prescribed by law, the actual costs of abatement of such signs shall become a debt owed to the city by the person responsible for or causing placement of the sign. Said debt shall be subject to cost recovery. 
C.  Unmaintained Sign Abatement. All signs shall be kept in good repair at all times or shall be subject to the following: 
1.  If the sign is not repaired or under repair within thirty (30) days after notification has occurred, the enforcement officer may issue an infraction citation. 
2.  If the sign is not repaired within thirty (30) days after the first citation, a second citation may be issued to the owner and/or user of the sign, and such violation may continue to be assessed each day thereafter until the sign is repaired. 
3.  The enforcement officer, upon identification of a hazardous or unsafe sign, shall give written notice to the property owner or party responsible for the sign of the condition or conditions which render the sign hazardous or unsafe, and an order to abate the public nuisance caused by the existence of the hazardous or unsafe sign. The enforcement officer will determine an appropriate time period for abatement of the public nuisance, based on the degree of the hazard. At the expiration of the time period, if the hazard has not been voluntarily abated, the enforcement officer shall proceed to abate the nuisance in accordance with the procedures contained in the Big Bear Lake Municipal Code. 
4.  When it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of this chapter, or when the enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that there exists any sign or condition which makes such sign unsafe, abandoned, illegal or nonconforming, the enforcement officer may petition the court to enter the lot, building, or premises on which such sign is located at all reasonable times to inspect the sign or to perform any duty imposed by this chapter. 
D.  Sign Removal. Every legal off-site sign becoming nonconforming as a result of this ordinance may be removed in accordance with the provisions of California Business and Professions Code Sections 5412, 5412.1, 5412.2, and 5412.3. All illegal signs listed below shall be forthwith removed by the owner or by the city with forty-eight (48) hours notice to the owner. 
1.  A sign which was legal but nonconforming that becomes illegal and nonconforming by the occurrence of [subsection] C.1, C.2, or C.3 above. 
2.  Any illegal sign. 
3.  A nonconforming sign which has exceeded its authorized amortization period. 
4.  An abandoned sign. 
5.  A display existing without permission of owner or lessee. 
E.  Amortization Period. Except as otherwise provided in state law for redevelopment project areas, all legal nonconforming signs, other than portable freestanding signs, shall have a useful life and legal life of fifteen (15) years, calculated from the date of adoption of this ordinance. Upon expiration of the sign amortization period, the sign shall be removed by the owner without compensation. Upon determination that a sign is nonconforming, the enforcement officer will issue written notice to the owner or user of the sign or to the owner of the property on which the nonconforming sign is located, requiring conformance or removal therefore if unable to conform. The written notice shall require that the nonconforming portable freestanding sign be removed or altered to comply with the requirements of this chapter within thirty (30) days from the date of said notice. If, after a reasonable diligent attempt to serve written notice, the owner and user have not received notice, then the city must either post the notice or publish the notice in a local newspaper which is customarily used for notice by the city. If the sign remains thereafter, the city may proceed with abatement procedures or other legal methods, with such costs of removal by the city to be charged against the owner. Nothing in this section shall preclude any owner or user from voluntarily conforming a nonconforming sign at any time prior to the expiration of the amortization period. For purposes of this section, written notification deposited in the U.S. mail, or personal delivery, or posting, or publication in a local newspaper shall constitute proper notice. 
F.  Amortization Period for Nonconforming Portable Freestanding Signs. All legal nonconforming portable freestanding signs shall be removed within one year of adoption of this ordinance. Upon expiration of the sign amortization period, the nonconforming portable freestanding sign shall be removed by the owner without compensation. Upon determination that a sign is nonconforming, the enforcement officer shall issue written notice to the owner or user of the sign or to the owner of the property on which the nonconforming portable freestanding sign is located and either post the notice or publish the same in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Big Bear Lake. The written notice shall require that the nonconforming portable freestanding sign be removed or altered to comply with the requirements of this chapter within thirty (30) days from the date of said notice. If the nonconforming portable freestanding sign remains thereafter, the city may proceed with abatement proceedings or other legal methods, with such costs of removal by the city to be charged against the owner. Nothing in this section shall preclude any owner or user from voluntarily conforming a nonconforming sign at any time prior to the expiration of the amortization period. For purposes of this section, written notification deposited in the U.S. mail, or personal delivery, or posting, or publication in a local newspaper shall constitute proper notice. 
G.  Inventory of Signs. Within six months of the date of adoption of this Ordinance the city planner shall cause to be performed an inventory of all on-premise and off-site directional signs within the city to identify those which are illegal or abandoned. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term "illegal" denotes a sign which was erected without compliance with all ordinances and regulations in effect at the time of its construction and erection or use, and the term "abandoned" denotes a sign which remains in place or is not maintained for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days which no longer advertises or identifies an ongoing business, product, or service available on the business premises where the sign is located (excluding seasonal businesses). When the inventory has been completed, the city planner shall report the actual cost of conducting that inventory to the city council so the council may by resolution provide for the recoupment of that cost in the manner authorized by Section 5491.2 of the Business and Professions Code, if desired. Upon completion of the required inventory, the city shall consider at a public hearing with the opportunity for public comment, whether there is a need for the ordinance or regulation that prohibits the use of any on-premises advertising display to take effect. No later than sixty (60) days after six months after the date of adoption of this Ordinance, the city shall commence abatement as provided in this section of the illegal and abandoned signs identified by the inventory. 
H.  Nonconforming Signs Abatement. Nonconforming signs which may be abated without payment of compensation. Any sign which does not comply with the requirements of this chapter and which may be abated without the payment of compensation pursuant to Section 5497 or 5498 of the Business and Professions Code shall be brought into compliance with the requirements of this chapter as soon as may reasonably be accomplished and in no event later than twelve (12) months after the date of adoption of this ordinance, unless such period is extended by the planning commission for good cause shown. Any such sign which is not brought into conformance with the requirements of this chapter within that time shall be deemed to be a public nuisance pursuant to California Government Code Section 38771 and shall be abated in accordance with the city's nuisance abatement procedures.

Chapter 17.13 - SPECIAL EVENTS 
 
17.13.010 - Intent and purpose. 
The intent of this chapter is to implement several policies and programs found in the Land Use and Open Space, Parks and Recreation Elements of the general plan. Those policies and programs include the following. Land Use Element Policy LU 2.3 and the associated Program LU 2.3.5 were established to promote Big Bear Lake as a resort destination by developing standards for special events and simplifying the permitting process while protecting public health and safety and limiting impacts to residents and businesses. Open Space, Parks and Recreation Element Policy OPR 4.1 supports the maintenance and expansion of cultural programs and special events which will enhance the quality of life for city residents, enhance the experience of visitors, and expand economic development opportunities for local businesses. Program OPR 4.1.1 directs staff to evaluate proposals for special events to ensure that appropriate facilities and services will exist to support the event and to ensure that the event will not negatively impact residents or visitors. 
In addition to the objectives expressed in the general plan, this chapter is intended to achieve the following objectives: 
A.  To encourage the production of outdoor special events and enable staff and applicants to determine the appropriate scope, scale, dates, and venues for such events; 
B.  To allow event organizers to produce special events for the benefit of the community, including businesses, citizens, and visitors; 
C.  To promote and protect public health, safety and general welfare during special events; 
D.  To protect property owners, business owners, and the general public from undue negative impacts that may be generated by special events; 
E.  To establish an effective process that enhances the community and promotes benefits to local property owners, business owners, and residences. 
(Ord. No. 2012-422, § 4, 12-10-2012)  
17.13.020 - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter, the terms and phrases, provided in alphabetical order below, shall have the following meanings: 
"Special event" shall mean a temporary outdoor use or group of related temporary outdoor uses of limited duration not regularly conducted on a site as a normal, ongoing component of the primary land use occupying the site. Special events vary in size and intensity and are separated into major special events and minor special events as defined below and as generally categorized in Table 17.13.020.A. 
Table 17.13.020.A. Event Size and Intensity 
Minor Special Event 	Major Special Event 
	Small-impact 	Medium-impact 	Large-impact 
Has no or negligible impact due to short duration and small scale. 	Has negligible to limited impact due to relatively short duration and small attendance. Also has limited potential for economic benefit. 	Has a potential for moderate impact due to relatively long duration and larger attendance. Also has moderate potential for economic benefit. 	Has potential for large impact due to long duration and large attendance. Also has significant potential for economic benefit. 
 
"Special event, major" shall mean a special event which, as determined by the city planner, has the potential to impact surrounding properties of the community because of the type or intensity of the proposed use, through generation of traffic, noise or other similar effects. Examples of major special events include: 
A.  Circuses, rodeos, carnivals, food truck shows, fairs, and festivals; 
B.  Parades, excepting those that are protected by the right to free expression under federal or state law; 
C.  Outdoor concerts, cultural performances, and large scale arts and crafts shows; 
D.  Athletic races and recreational events, such as triathlons, marathons, and motorcycle rides; 
E.  Car shows, truck shows, and boat shows; 
F.  Certified farmers market or similar collective sale of produce and related goods; 
G.  Other events and activities similar in scope and nature to the above, as determined by the city planner. 
"Special event, minor" shall mean a special event, which as determined by the city planner, will cause no or negligible impact to the surrounding properties or the community due to its small scale, location, and the nature of the uses. Examples of minor special events include: 
A.  Small-scale arts and crafts sales conducted on a site having adequate paved parking and access to accommodate the event without impacting primary uses on the site; 
B.  Bake sales, candy sales, and similar fundraising activities conducted on commercial premises, provided that no pedestrian or vehicular access will be blocked; 
C.  Seasonal activities, including the retail sale of agricultural products prior to and typically associated with holidays, such as Christmas trees or pumpkins, haunted houses or other similar events; 
D.  Grand openings of businesses in commercial zones provided that each such event shall last no longer than fifteen (15) consecutive days. For purposes of this section, "grand opening" shall mean outdoor activities on a site to celebrate a new structure, site improvement, or the commencement of a commercial activity thereon; 
E.  Parking lot sales or sidewalk sales in commercial zones, for outdoor sale of merchandise typically sold on the premises, provided that adequate parking and vehicular access is maintained and pedestrian pathways are provided for disabled access as required by law; and 
F.  Car washes conducted by registered non-profit organizations for fundraising purposes, provided that the following requirements are met: 
1.  The applicant has obtained approval for the car wash from Big Bear Municipal Water District; 
2.  The applicant has obtained approval of a watering exemption permit from the department of water and power; 
3.  Buckets shall be used and hoses shall be equipped with shut-off nozzles to reduce water consumption and runoff; 
4.  No portions of the operation, including solicitation for customers, shall be allowed in the public roadway. 
G.  Private events open to the general public. 
(Ord. No. 2012-422, § 4, 12-10-2012)  
17.13.030 - Special event location types and events permitted. 
A.  For the purposes of this chapter, special event venues are divided into two general categories, public facilities and private facilities. 
1.  Public facilities include, but are not limited to, parks, streets, parking lots, and the Civic Center. While these facilities offer utilities desirable to event organizers, they are primarily intended to be resources for residents and visitors to use for recreation, mobility, and parking. Section 17.13.040 includes regulations specific to the closure and use of city facilities. 
a.  Public parks include, but are not limited to, Rotary Park, Veteran's Park, and Boulder Bay Park. Public parks are recommended for smaller events with minimal parking demand. For the purposes of this chapter, Meadow Park is considered a permanent event venue, provided that parking areas are to remain open for public parking. 
b.  Streets are designated as primary arterial, secondary arterial, collector, and local streets in the Circulation Element of the general plan. They are used for personal vehicles, public transit, goods movement, and emergency response. Due to topological and other physical constraints, alternative routes are limited in the Big Bear Valley. Therefore, streets are not recommended for special events unless anticipated impacts may be adequately mitigated. 
i.  For the purposes of this chapter, Highway 18, Pine Knot Avenue, Village Drive and associated sidewalks are distinguished from all other city streets because they have a unique role to the city in terms of both economic activity and overall circulation. When applicants propose to use or close Highway 18, Pine Knot Avenue, and/or Village Drive, the city engineer and economic development director should be consulted. 
(1)  The city engineer should be consulted to determine if anticipated volumes of traffic may be reasonably detoured. Generally, holiday, summer, and Saturday traffic is more difficult to detour due to higher traffic volumes. 
(2)  The economic development director should be consulted to evaluate the extent of economic impacts that may be caused by a street closure. 
c.  Parking lots include, but are not limited to, the Alden Road, Bartlett Road, Indian Village, and Civic Center lots. These locations are recommended for events that require large open areas, but have limited need for electricity and other utilities. 
d.  The Civic Center is located at 39707 Big Bear Boulevard. The Civic Center grounds are recommended for events that include both indoor and outdoor activities. 
e.  The following maps, in Table 17.13.030.A, generally illustrate public event venue areas. Other public areas and street sections may be used for special events. Those areas and street sections shall be treated in the same manner as the area or street section most similar, as determined by the city planner.

2.  Private facilities include permanent event venues and temporary event venues. This chapter is not intended to limit the ability of private property owners to allow their properties to be used for special events. Instead, the purpose is to ensure that when private properties are used for special events, impacts to the neighborhood and the community may be mitigated. 
a.  Permanent private event venues may be used for events with no additional review because they have been analyzed for impacts as part of a land use approval. Commercial parking areas located at a private event venue may also be used for special events without approval of a special event permit, provided that the facility is used in a manner that maintains public safety and is free of public nuisance. 
b.  Temporary private event venues may be used for special events with approval from the city planner or the planning commission according to Table 17.13.030.B. These facilities have limited or no built-in infrastructure to support large outdoor gatherings and, as a result, need a higher level of analysis that may result in special conditions and/or limitations. Examples of temporary private event venues include, but are not limited to, vacant commercial lots like the property commonly known as Christmas Tree Corner (40803 Village Drive) and commercial parking lots such as those adjacent to office buildings or shopping centers. 
B.  Special events may be permitted only in those special event venues where expressly or conditionally permitted according to Table 17.13.030.B. 
1.  Use of Table 17.13.030.B shall be guided by city council administrative instructions as they may be amended from time to time. The administrative policies may classify the size and impact of special events based on characteristics such as, but not limited to, duration, attendance, visitor draw, event reach, and economic impact. Such classifications shall be used by the city planner and planning commission to determine if an event is minor or major and, for major special events, to determine if the impact is small, medium or large. 
2.  According to Table 17.13.030.B, an event may be permitted by right, permitted, discretionary, or discretionary with a special finding. 
a.  "Permitted by right" shall mean that the event is permitted without approval of a special event application; 
b.  "Permitted" shall mean that the event may be permitted with the approval of a minor special event application; 
c.  "Discretionary" shall mean that the event may be permitted with the approval of a major special event application; 
d.  "Discretionary with special finding" shall mean that the event may or may not be permitted depending on the proposed date and intensity of the event. 
i.  The following dates tend to generate high volumes of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the City of Big Bear Lake. Therefore, events proposed for the following dates will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny by the planning commission and must demonstrate a compelling reason to use or close public property during a period of high impacts to vehicular and pedestrian circulation. 
(1)  Seven days before Independence Day through seven days after Labor Day; 
(2)  Nationally recognized holidays, including New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas week through New Year's week; 
(3)  Weekends associated with nationally recognized major holidays including President's Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving Day; or 
(4)  Other dates as determined by the city council. 
ii.  For events proposed during the dates listed in this section, the reviewing authority shall make a special finding that: 
(1)  The event is consistent with relevant administrative policies adopted by the city council, as they may be amended from time to time, and 
(2)  The benefits generated by the visitor draw, event reach, and/or economic benefit are sufficient to offset potential negative impacts such as loss of parking, street closures, and/or other impacts. 
iii.  For events proposed during the dates that are not listed in this section, the reviewing authority may approve the event without making a special finding. 
e.  "Not permitted" shall mean that the event is not allowed because the size and intensity of the temporary event has the potential to cause significant negative impacts for the surrounding neighborhood and businesses for an unreasonable period. 
3.  Larger impact events may be approved to use smaller event venues if the event may be reasonably accommodated in the smaller area.

3.  Public notice shall not be required for issuance of minor special events. 
D.  Reviewing Authority. 
1.  The planning commission shall be the reviewing authority for first-time major special event applications. After an applicant has demonstrated two years of consistency and success with a single event, the planning commission may authorize the city planner to approve that event thereafter, provided that no significant changes are proposed. Determinations of consistency and success shall be made by the planning commission based on the "recurring special event report" required in this section. Significant changes include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Adding activities that may introduce new negative impacts to the neighborhood or community as determined by the city planner; 
b.  Changing event venues; 
c.  Changing the site plan in a manner that may introduce new negative impacts to the neighborhood or community as determined by the city planner. 
2.  The city planner or his/her designee shall have reviewing authority for all minor special events. 
E.  Findings for Approval. 
1.  The reviewing authority may deny, approve, or conditionally approve a request for a special event permit based on the following findings for approval. 
a.  The use is consistent with the general purposes of the general plan and this chapter and the specific provisions of the zoning district in which the site is located, and any other applicable codes and policies; 
b.  Appropriate measures have been taken to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize detrimental effects to adjacent properties, businesses and the community; 
c.  The event will have adequate parking, ingress and egress, traffic circulation and access, and provision for pedestrian safety; 
d.  All structures and equipment will be erected and maintained in compliance with the applicable codes; and 
e.  The subject site will be restored to its original or better condition upon termination of the special event. 
2.  For events listed as "Discretionary with special finding" in Table 17.13.030.B, the reviewing authority shall make an additional finding as follows and based on the city council administrative instruction for special event application review as it may be amended from time to time. 
a.  The event has been determined to be a minor special event or major special event with a small-, medium-, or large-impact and has also been determined, based on the city council administrative instruction, to offer sufficient returns to the community to offset economic impacts due to the loss of parking, street closures, and/or other such concerns because of the proposed visitor draw, event reach, and/or economic potential. 
F.  Community Events Grants. 
1.  Once an event has been approved by the planning commission or city planner, applicants may be eligible for reimbursement for fees through a community events grant. The grant program is explained in City Council Administrative Instruction 2004-01, which may be amended from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 2012-422, § 4, 12-10-2012)  
17.13.060 - Performance standards. 
A.  The performance standards included in this section are intended to protect the community from undue special event impacts. These performance standards may apply to all events, including those that are exempt as listed in Section 17.13.030.E. However, not all performance standards are applicable to all events. Therefore, the specific performance standards applied to an event will be determined as part of application approval. Due to the nature of special events, the city can not foresee all necessary performance standards. Consequently, the reviewing authority may condition an event to meet performance standards not listed in this section. 
B.  Fees and Cost Recovery. 
1.  The city will require a cash deposit or other security, as determined by the city engineer, for events proposed on public property. The city may require a cash deposit or other security for events proposed on private property if that event is determined to have a potential impact to public property or surrounding private properties. Such potential impacts may be caused by stormwater, trash, or other nuisances that necessitate the use of public resources for clean up or repair. The cash deposit or other security will be used to defray the cost of returning a public or private event venue to its original or better condition, should the applicant fail to leave the property in a satisfactory condition. 
2.  The cash deposit or security shall reflect the estimate of staff time and materials supplied to support the event as determined by the city engineer. 
3.  City costs shall be based on the fully burdened hourly rate for staff time and material that is required to support the event. Said cost shall be determined by the fee schedule set by the city council. 
4.  Prior to returning the balance of the security to the applicant the city engineer shall provide a written cost analysis of staff time and material to the applicant and shall deduct that amount from the cash deposit or security. If clean up has not been completed within twenty-four (24) hours, the event organizer will be notified. If clean up has not been completed within forty-eight (48) hours, then the city will complete clean up and the cost of that clean up will be deducted from the security deposit. 
C.  Time and Duration. 
1.  Unless otherwise specified in the permit, public facilities may be closed for set up no more than twenty-four (24) hours before the event is opened to the public. 
2.  Unless otherwise specified in the permit, all sites for temporary uses shall be cleaned of trash, debris and temporary structures and otherwise restored within twenty-four (24) hours after the conclusion of the event. 
D.  Traffic, Circulation and Parking. 
1.  Events proposing to close parking lots, to close streets, or to generate a parking demand that is higher than parking available on-site may be required to implement a parking and traffic plan. For the purposes of special events, parking demand shall be calculated based on two people per vehicle, unless otherwise determined by the city planner. The parking plan will be distributed to the code compliance division for enforcement. Vehicles not in compliance with the parking plan are hereby considered a public nuisance, subject to the enforcement provisions of the Municipal Code and other applicable laws, which authorize citations or towing. 
2.  Provisions shall be made for adequate handicap and standard parking, emergency personnel and emergency vehicle access, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, fire protection, security, and traffic control. 
3.  Shuttle services or valet parking may be required where parking is not immediately adjacent to the event or where access to the event is unsafe for pedestrians. 
4.  All events serving alcohol shall coordinate with an established designated driver program. If such a program is not available other provisions to discourage drunk driving may be required of the applicant. Other provisions to discourage drunk driving should include information about transportation alternatives, such as taxis or buses.

And that: 
"No person shall operate or permit the operation or playing of any device which reproduces, produces, or amplifies sound in such a manner as to be loud, excessive, raucous or disturbing from 50 feet, if such device is operated on or over any public right-of-way, except as otherwise authorized through issuance of a Special Event Permit, pursuant to [Chapter 17.13] (emphasis added)."

17.13.070 - Village event regulations. 
A.  The Village Specific Plan, Ordinance No. 87-142, has been adopted to enhance and support the traditional business core with the intent of expanding urban development, enhancing the character of the marketplace, and enhancing the city's nature as a resort destination. The plan contains a "Uses Permitted by District Chart" to designate where various types of events may be allowed in the Village Specific Plan Area. This Section 17.13.070 is intended to reinforce and implement the business and tourist-oriented objectives of the Village Specific Plan, and to replace the "Uses Permitted by District Chart" contained therein.

Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001.(b)(3), an "eligible facilities request" is defined as any request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving: 
1.  Collocation of new transmission equipment; 
2.  Removal of transmission equipment; or 
3.  Replacement of transmission equipment. 
B.  A substantial change, as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001, is a change where the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure meets any of the criteria in subsections B.1. to B.6., below. Notwithstanding any other provisions in Title 17 to the contrary, a substantial change to an eligible support structure shall be subject to Section 17.03.170 (Conditional Use Permit) and the requirements of this chapter: 
1.  For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it increases the height of the tower by more than ten percent (10%) or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by more than ten percent (10%) or more than ten (10) feet, whichever is greater; 
a.  Changes in height are measured from the original support structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally, such as on buildings' rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height are measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station, inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the adoption of this chapter. 
2.  For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than twenty (20) feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six feet; 
3.  For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four cabinets; or, for towers in the public rights-of-way and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than ten percent (10%) larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure; 
4.  It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site; 
5.  It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support structure; or 
6.  It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base station equipment, provided however that this limitation does not apply to any modification that is non-compliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds identified in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(7)(i) through (iv). 
C.  Upon receipt of an application for an "eligible facilities request", the city planner, or his/her designee, shall make a decision on the application within sixty (60) days from the date in which an application is received, unless it is determined that the application is not covered under subsection A., above, or unless the time for action has been tolled by a timely notice of incompleteness, or by mutual agreement with the applicant. 
D.  Upon receipt of an application for a collocation or modification to an eligible support structure where it is determined to be a substantial change in accordance with subsection B., above, the planning commission shall make a decision on the application within ninety (90) days from the date in which an application is received, or unless the time for action has been tolled by a timely notice of incompleteness, or by mutual agreement with the applicant. 
E.  All other siting applications relative to "personal wireless service" facilities, as defined in Section 6409(a) (47 U.S.C. 1455) and eligible for Federal Communication Commission timelines pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7), the planning commission shall make a decision on the application within one hundred fifty (150) days from the date in which an application is received, or unless the time for action has been tolled by a timely notice of incompleteness, or by mutual agreement with the applicant. 
F.  Effect of Changes to Federal Law. This section does not and shall not be construed to grant any rights beyond those granted by Section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (codified at 47 U.S.C. 1455) as implemented by 47 C.F.R. 1.40001. In the event Section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (codified at 47 U.S.C. 1455) or 47 C.F.R. 1.40001 are stayed, amended, revised or otherwise not in effect, no modifications to a wireless communications facility shall be approved under this section.

Chapter 17.25 - RESIDENTIAL ZONES 
Sections: 
 
17.25.010 - Intent and purpose of residential zones. 
A.  The residential zones are established to implement Land Use Goal L3 of the general plan, "To provide for development of housing opportunities to meet the long-term needs of permanent and part-time residents as well as visitors, and all demographic and economic segments of the population, while preserving the character and integrity of residential neighborhoods." 
B.  In addition to implementing the goals and policies of the general plan with respect to residential land use, this chapter and the accompanying official zoning map are intended to achieve the following objectives: 
1.  To reserve appropriately located areas for residential use at various ranges of dwelling unit densities and type; 
2.  To ensure adequate access, privacy, and open space for each dwelling; 
3.  To protect residential properties and dwellings from incompatible uses, light, glare, odors, visual blight, and other objectionable conditions; 
4.  To facilitate the provision of utility services and other public facilities commensurate with anticipated population, dwelling unit density, and service requirements; and 
5.  To promote design and construction techniques that complement the natural resources and topography of Big Bear Lake's mountain setting, and that encourage energy and water conservation. 
(Ord. 2003-333 § 4 (Exh. A (part)), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.25.020 - Residential zone districts. 
Three base zone districts are established as follows: 
A.  Residential-Low (R-L) Zone. 
1.  The residential-low (R-L) zone is established for the development of single-family detached dwellings at a maximum density of one dwelling unit per gross acre, and a minimum lot size of forty thousand (40,000) square feet. Actual permitted lot size and density within the R-L zone shall be determined by the underlying general plan designation, and by topographic, environmental, physical or infrastructural constraints. 
2.  The R-L zone is appropriate for areas that are, or are planned to be, used for low-density single-family residential development. Development within the R-L zone generally consists of single-family homes on larger lots, where the keeping of horses is permitted. Accessory uses to support the primary residential use and accessory equestrian uses are also permitted. Some non-residential uses, which are complementary and not detrimental to residential neighborhoods, are conditionally permitted. 
3.  The R-L zone is compatible with the following general plan land use designations: 
a.  Equestrian estates (EE), provided that a gross residential density of one unit per acre is not exceeded; or 
b.  Rural residential (RR), provided that a gross residential density of one unit per two and one-half acres is not exceeded. 
B.  Single-Family Residential (R-1) Zone. 
1.  The single-family residential (R-1) zone is established for the development of single-family detached homes at gross densities ranging from one to four dwelling units per acre and a minimum lot size of seven thousand two hundred (7,200) square feet. Actual permitted density and lot size shall be determined by the underlying general plan designation, and by topographic, environmental, physical, and infrastructural constraints. In order to encourage the production of housing affordable to low-to-moderate income households, density bonuses of up to one hundred percent (100%) may be granted in this zone, subject to approval of an agreement pursuant to Section 17.03.230. 
2.  Development within the R-1 zone generally consists of single-family residential neighborhoods of a suburban type and density. The keeping of horses is not permitted in this zone. Accessory uses to support the primary residential use are allowed. Non-residential uses, which are complementary and not detrimental to residential neighborhoods, are conditionally permitted. 
3.  The R-1 zone is compatible with the following general plan land use designations: 
a.  Single-family residential two du/ac (SFR-2), provided that a gross residential density of two units per acre is not exceeded. Minimum lot size within this designation shall be eighteen thousand (18,000) square feet. 
b.  Single-family residential three du/ac (SFR-3), provided that a gross residential density of three units per acre is not exceeded. Minimum lot size within this designation shall be ten thousand (10,000) square feet. 
c.  Single-family residential four du/ac (SFR-4), provided that a gross residential density of four units per acre is not exceeded. Minimum lot size within this designation shall be seven thousand two hundred (7,200) square feet. 
C.  Multiple Residential (R-3) Zone. 
1.  The multiple residential (R-3) zone is established for the development of grouped housing, such as townhouses, condominiums, apartments, and mobilehome parks, at gross densities ranging from four to twelve (12) dwelling units per acre. The actual permitted density shall be determined based on topographical, environmental, physical, and infrastructural constraints. In order to encourage the production of housing affordable to low-to-moderate income households, density bonuses may be granted in this zone, subject to approval of an agreement pursuant to Section 17.03.230 (Affordable Housing Agreements). 
2.  Development within the R-3 zone generally consists of attached or grouped dwelling units within a development site that share common access, open spaces, and amenities. This zone may also be appropriate for single-family detached units on smaller lots within the context of an approved specific plan. The R-3 zone permits the development of self-contained residential communities which provide recreational facilities and amenities to serve residents, as well as for smaller-scale attached dwellings on a single residential lot (such as a duplex). Accessory uses to support the primary residential use are allowed. Non-residential uses, which are complementary and not detrimental to residential neighborhoods, are conditionally permitted. 
3.  The R-3 zone is compatible with the multiple family residential (MFR) general plan land use designation. 
(Ord. 2003-333 § 4 (Exh. A (part)), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.25.030 - Principal uses permitted in residential zones. 
A.  Principal uses permitted within residential zones shall be those included on Table 17.25.030.A. In the event that a determination is requested as to whether a principal use is permitted in the residential zones which is not listed on Table 17.25.030.A, the reviewing authority shall make that determination in accordance with Section 17.03.210. 
B.  Where Table 17.25.030.A indicates that a use is permitted subject to a specific land use approval process, procedures for that approval process set forth in Chapter 17.03 shall be followed, except as otherwise indicated. Where Table 17.25.030.A indicates that a use is subject to special development standards contained in this chapter, the applicable sections of this chapter shall be referenced in review and approval of said use. 
C.  This section shall not be construed to supersede more restrictive use regulations in the conditions, covenants and restrictions of any property or dwelling unit. 
D.  The minimum lot size on which multiple family dwellings may be established is seven thousand two hundred (7,200) square feet. A lot of this size may accommodate no more than two dwelling units. For lots on which three or more dwellings are proposed, no less than three thousand five hundred (3,500) square feet of net lot area shall be provided per dwelling unit.

17.25.050 - General standards for residential development. 
A.  The development standards set forth in Table 17.25.050.A are intended to provide minimum standards for residential development. These standards should be used in conjunction with the special development standards contained in this chapter applicable to specific uses as indicated on said table. 
B.  This section shall not be construed to supersede more restrictive site development standards contained in the conditions, covenants and restrictions of any property or dwelling unit, or as shown on the composite development plan or final map for any subdivision. However, in no case shall private deed restrictions or map requirements be interpreted to allow a lesser standard (in the case of a minimum standard) or a greater standard (in the case of a maximum standard) than the development standards set forth herein. 
C.  Deviations from the standards set forth in this section may only be allowed by approval of a variance or minor deviation, pursuant to Section 17.03.180; or through approval of a comprehensive development plan pursuant to Section 17.03.280 (Specific Plan Review) or Section 17.03.220 (Development Agreements). 
D.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as making lots illegal which were legally created prior to the adoption of these regulations. For information on non-conforming uses and structures, see Section 17.03.320 of the Development Code.

17.25.060 - Additional setback regulations. 
A.  General Setback Provisions. 
1.  Each lot or parcel of residentially-zoned land shall have minimum front, side, and rear yard setbacks, and setbacks between buildings, as required for the zone in which the property is located, for the specific use when applicable, or by this section, whichever requirement is the greatest, except as modified by an adopted specific plan or development agreement. The reviewing authority may require setbacks greater than the minimum requirement in order to meet the goals and policies of the general plan, including but not limited to minimizing grading, tree removal, degradation of sensitive habitat, land use impacts, or other similar objectives. 
2.  In a case where a final tract map has been recorded that indicates minimum setback requirements less than those set forth in this chapter, the setback requirements of this chapter shall apply. In a case where a final tract map or composite development plan has been approved or recorded that indicates setback requirements in excess of those set forth in this chapter, the greater standard shall apply. 
3.  Setbacks from streets shall be measured from the edge of the ultimate public or private street right-of-way, to the nearest edge of the building. 
B.  Setbacks for Animal Uses in R-L Zone. 
1.  Any building or enclosure used for keeping animals shall be located at least fifty (50) feet from the front property line, and at least seventy (70) feet from buildings used for human habitation, public parks, schools, hospitals, churches or similar assembly-type uses. For purposes of this section, buildings used for human habitation shall not include attached or detached garages or storage buildings. 
2.  Animal enclosures shall be located at least five feet from interior side and rear property lines, and fifteen (15) feet from side street rights-of-way (excepting bridle paths).

A minimum distance of ten (10) feet (including eaves) is required between a primary residential unit and a detached accessory dwelling unit established on the same lot or parcel of land. 
3.  A minimum distance of six feet is required between any other detached accessory structure and a primary residential structure established on the same lot or parcel of land. 
D.  Setbacks for Accessory Structures Applicable to All Residential Zones. 
1.  All satellite dishes and antennae shall meet the setback requirements of the zone. 
2.  Swimming pools and spas at grade, including all accessory or appurtenant structures and equipment, may encroach into interior side and rear yard setbacks but no closer than five feet to the lot line; in no case shall these structures be permitted within the front yard or side street yard. In cases where accessory equipment is housed in an enclosed building, the setbacks shall be the same as for storage sheds. 
3.  Tennis courts and play courts shall be set back a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from the rear and side lot lines, and ten (10) feet from any other structure; they are not permitted within the front setback (see Section 17.25.140).

5.  Storage sheds, children's playhouses, attached or detached patio covers, gazebos, and other similar non-habitable structures that are over ten (10) feet in height shall not be located closer than fifteen (15) feet from the rear property line. The front and side yard setbacks shall be the same as required for the main structure. 
6.  A fence or wall not more than six feet in height or a hedge maintained so as not to exceed six feet in height may be located on the interior side or rear lot lines, provided that such fence, wall, or hedge does not exceed a height of forty-eight (48) inches within the required front yard or street side yard (except as provided in paragraph 7 below). 
7.  Within the required front yard and street side yards of residentially zoned properties, a solid fence, wall, or hedge may not exceed forty-eight (48) inches in height. Fences may exceed forty-eight (48) inches in height in these areas provided that either the entire fence or the portion of the fence above forty-eight (48) inches above natural grade shall be of decorative open-view materials (e.g., tubular steel, wrought-iron, split rail, or other material which does not obstruct views). Any such wall or fence shall be located within the property line of the subject parcel and outside of any access easement. Within zone R-3, any gates for vehicles must be set back a minimum of twenty (20) feet from the property line to allow for vehicle parking when the gate is closed. 
8.  Where garages that serve residential uses are accessed from an alley at the rear of the lot, the garage may encroach into the required rear yard up to five feet from the rear lot line. 
E.  Setbacks for Non-Residential Uses in Residential Zones. 
1.  A church, library, museum, camp, conference center, retreat center, or other institutional use conditionally permitted in residential zones shall be located at least twenty-five (25) feet from any lot or boundary line of adjoining property which is zoned or used for residential purposes, and at least fifteen (15) feet from side, side street and rear lot lines which do not abut residential properties, in addition to meeting other setback requirements of the zone. 
2.  In the case of a church, library, museum, camp, conference center, retreat center, or other institutional use conditionally permitted in residential zones, no required front yard or side street yard is to be used for the parking of vehicles. Parking may be permitted in the interior side and rear yards provided that such parking is located at least five feet from the side or rear lot line. 
3.  For hotels, motels, bed and breakfast establishments, and other commercial lodging facilities located in residential zones, the minimum side yard setback shall be ten (10) feet; except that when the buildings are arranged on the site so that the rear of the building abuts one side yard and faces the opposite side yard, the front of the building shall be no closer than fifteen (15) feet to the side property line which it faces. When such uses are located on a site in parallel rows which face each other across a courtyard, the minimum building separation shall be thirty (30) feet from the front of one building to the front of the other. 
F.  Distances Between Buildings for Multiple Family Residential Developments. 
1.  The minimum distance from the front of one residential building to the front of another residential building within the same development project shall be thirty (30) feet.

1.  Eaves, awnings, cornices, chimneys, wing walls, bay windows without floor area, or other similar architectural features attached to the main building and supported at or behind the building setback line, may project into any required yard a maximum of three feet, except that in no case may such features encroach closer than thirty (30) inches to the property line. Bay windows exceeding twelve (12) feet in width or fifty percent (50%) or more of the width of the wall on which they are located must conform to the setback requirements for the main structure. 
2.  Uncovered decks, balconies, platforms, entryways, landings, and walkways which do not extend above the level of the ground floor of the building or do not exceed a height of forty-eight (48) inches above grade may encroach into any required front or street side yard not more than six feet, and into any required interior side or rear yard by not more than six feet or closer than two feet to the property line. An openwork railing not more than four feet in height may be installed or constructed on any such structure. 
3.  Uncovered bridges or platforms providing access to required parking areas, parking platforms, and main entries may be permitted in the front or street side setback areas, providing that no portion of said bridge or platform other than required handrails or guardrails may exceed eighteen (18) inches in height as measured from the grade of the edge of right-of-way. An openwork railing not more than four feet in height may be installed or constructed on any such structure.

(Ord. 2003-333 § 4 (Exh. A (part)), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.25.070 - Residential parking standards. 
A.  General Parking Requirements for Residential Zones. 
1.  Off-street parking shall be provided for any new building constructed and for any new uses established, for any addition or enlargement of an existing building or use, and for any change in the occupancy of a building or the manner in which any use is conducted, that would result in additional parking spaces being required, subject to the provisions of this section. 
2.  No existing use of land or existing structure where parking for said use or structure was conforming at the time of establishment or modification, shall be deemed to be nonconforming solely because of the lack of off-street parking facilities prescribed by this section. Facilities being used for off-street parking may be reduced in capacity to the minimum standards prescribed in this chapter to provide for landscaping and snow storage. 
3.  All off-street parking spaces and driveway areas shall be paved and maintained for the duration of the use requiring such areas in accordance with city standards. 
4.  All required parking spaces, including covered spaces, shall be maintained exclusively for the parking of vehicles of the occupant(s) of the premises or their guests. 
5.  All required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use to be served. 
6.  Vehicle parking shall be allowed within designated driveways, parking pads or garages. No parking of vehicles shall be permitted within the natural open space area provided within the front, side or rear yards of the dwelling unit. 
7.  Where the application of the off-street parking requirements results in a fractional number of spaces, a fraction of one-half or greater shall be rounded to the next higher whole number, and a fraction of less than one-half shall not be counted. 
8.  The required parking is cumulative for all of the uses proposed on the same lot, except as otherwise approved. The applicant may submit a parking study prepared by a qualified traffic engineer to justify the provision of a lesser number of spaces than that required by this section, based on shared use of spaces, the nature of the use, or other factors, and the reviewing authority may approve a reduction of the parking requirement based upon the recommendations contained in the approved parking study as part of the land use approval process. In the event no other land use approval process is required to establish the uses in question, a minor modification allowing reduction in required parking based upon an approved parking study may be approved. 
9.  The off-street parking requirements contained in this section are minimums for the listed uses. If evidence before the reviewing authority shows that a specific application will result in a higher demand for parking than is normally expected for that type of use, a greater number of spaces may be required. 
10.  Parking of abandoned, unlicensed, or inoperative vehicles is subject to and will be abated pursuant to applicable provisions of the Big Bear Lake Municipal Code and the California Vehicle Code. 
11.  Commercial vehicles, as defined in Section 22507.5 of the California Vehicle Code, shall not be parked on any public or private property used for residential purposes unless they are: (1) in the process of making an immediate pickup or delivery of goods; or (2) making a service call to the occupants of the premises; or (3) said vehicle is used by an occupant of the premises as a primary means of transportation to and from work. 
B.  Parking for Single-Family Residential Zones and Uses. 
1.  Single-family detached residential dwelling units in any zone shall be provided with a minimum of two parking spaces, which may be tandem spaces. 
2.  No alteration of a single-family dwelling unit which has at least one covered parking space at the time such alteration is proposed shall be approved, if said alteration would result in the elimination of all covered parking spaces on the lot; at least one covered parking space shall be maintained. 
3.  Parking for recreational vehicles, boats, trailers, camper shells, off-road vehicles, personal watercraft and similar items is permitted within the side yard or rear yard of the dwelling unit, provided that such items are stored on a paved or impermeable surface and that screening is provided from adjacent rights-of-way. These items shall not be parked within the area of the lot considered to be the front yard (excluding the driveway). No more than two of these items may be kept on a single-family residential lot, except within a permitted, enclosed building. 
4.  Except as otherwise allowed by a home occupation permit issued pursuant to Section 17.03.270, parking or storage of commercial or business-related vehicles, equipment, materials, and tools is not permitted on single-family residential lots; except that a business or commercial vehicle regularly used to transport a resident of the home to and from that person's place of employment is exempt from this restriction. 
5.  The use of tents, canopies or similar devices to shade vehicles is not allowed in residential zones. Where provided, covered parking shall consist of permanent structures, such as garages or carports, and shall meet all applicable codes. This section shall not be interpreted to restrict the use of vehicle coverings that are attached to the vehicle and are not affixed to the ground. 
6.  Where provided, garages and carports shall meet all applicable codes. A single-car garage for single-family residential use shall have minimum clear inside dimensions of ten (10) feet (width) by twenty (20) feet (length). A double-car garage shall have minimum inside dimensions of twenty (20) feet by twenty (20) feet. Additional parking spaces within an enclosed garage shall be a minimum of nine by nineteen (19) feet each. 
7.  The minimum driveway width for a single-family residence shall be twelve (12) feet, and the maximum driveway width at the street shall be twenty-four (24) feet. Driveways for garages accommodating three or more vehicles shall be tapered down at the street. 
8.  Driveways for single-family residential uses shall not exceed a grade of fourteen percent (14%), except as otherwise approved by the city engineer and fire department. 
C.  Parking for Small-Scale Multiple Family Residential Uses (two, three, four, or five family dwellings). 
1.  Construction of new attached or detached two, three, four, or five family dwellings shall be required to provide two parking spaces per dwelling unit, of which one parking space shall be covered. When the addition of new units to existing units is proposed to increase the residential density of the site, at least one covered parking space for each existing and proposed dwelling unit on the site shall be provided, in addition to the required uncovered parking. 
2.  For additions and/or alterations to existing two, three, four, or five family dwellings which do not result in increased density on the site, and for which there exists no covered parking spaces at the time the addition or alteration is proposed, provision of covered parking spaces shall not be required; except that any such addition or alteration shall not be located or configured on the lot so as to preclude the future construction of accessible, covered parking spaces for each unit on the lot. 
3.  Parking spaces provided pursuant to this section shall be located no further than one hundred (100) feet from the main entry of the dwelling unit they are intended to serve, except as otherwise approved by the reviewing authority to limit tree removal or grading. 
4.  Parking for recreational vehicles, boats, trailers, camper shells, off-road vehicles, personal watercraft and similar items is permitted within the side yards or rear yards of the dwelling units, provided that such items are stored on a paved or impermeable surface and that screening is provided from adjacent rights-of-way. These items shall not be parked within the area of the lot considered to be the front yard (excluding the driveway) of any dwelling unit. No more than two of these items may be kept on the lot, except within a permitted, enclosed building. 
5.  Except as otherwise allowed by a home occupation permit issued pursuant to Section 17.03.270, parking or storage of commercial or business-related vehicles, equipment, material and tools is not permitted; except that a business or commercial vehicle regularly used to transport a resident of one of the units to and from that person's place of employment is exempt from this prohibition.

1.  For affordable housing projects on which the city has granted either a density bonus and at least one other incentive, or other incentives having equivalent value based on land cost per dwelling unit, the applicant shall agree to the following requirements: 
a.  The continued affordability of all lower income and/or very low income units, or the continued designation of units for qualified residents, for no less than thirty (30) years, or longer if required by the financing requirements of the project; 
b.  Rents charged for lower income households shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of sixty percent (60%) of the area median income; 
c.  Rents charged for very low income households shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of fifty percent (50%) of the area median income; 
d.  Provision of for-sale units targeted for lower or very low income households shall be affordable at a cost that such households can realistically qualify for according to standard lending practices, taking into consideration any subsidies or other financial assistance provided to the project. 
2.  For affordable housing projects on which the city has granted only a density bonus, with no other incentive, the applicant shall agree to maintain the continued affordability of very low and lower income households for not less than ten (10) years, as specified in paragraph C.1 above. 
D.  Calculation of Density Bonus. For housing developments proposing provision of dwelling units set aside for lower income, and very low income households, and/or qualifying residents, a density bonus shall be granted pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915. 
E.  Disapproval of Affordable Housing Development. In conformance with Section 65589.5 of the California Government Code, the city shall not disapprove of a housing development project for very low, low or moderate-income households, or condition approval in a manner that renders the project infeasible for development, or approve a lower density than what was requested, unless the appropriate findings contained in said section are made by the reviewing authority.

17.25.210 - Second dwelling units. 
A.  Section 65852.2(c) of the California Government Code requires that no local agency shall adopt an ordinance which totally precludes second units within single-family and multifamily residential zones, unless certain findings are made in said ordinance pursuant to Section 65852.2(c). The purpose of this section of the Development Code is to set forth the required findings to preclude the establishments of second units within single-family residential zones in accordance with state law. For purposes of this section, a second dwelling unit shall mean a separate dwelling unit on a residential lot zoned for single-family residences (including zones R-L and R-1), where a dwelling unit already exists. 
B.  The following findings are made in support of prohibiting second dwelling units in residential zones within the city: 
1.  The limitation on second units will not result in a housing shortage because of the abundance of vacant dwelling units and the lack of a demonstrated need for second units in order to meet housing objectives as set forth in the General Plan Housing Element. On October 26, 1983 the City of Big Bear Lake adopted Ordinance No. 83-92, which prohibited the establishment of second units in residential zones based on the required findings of Section 65852.2(c) of the California Government Code. In that ordinance the city council found that due to the nature of the local tourist-based economy, approximately seventy percent (70%) of the dwelling units in Big Bear Lake were not occupied by full-time residents, and adequate housing stock was available to serve the housing needs of the community at that time. Based on the city's certified Housing Element adopted on February 11, 2002, and on data provided by the California Department of Finance as of January 1, 2002, the number of dwelling units occupied on a part-time basis has remained at seventy percent (70%) or greater. Records maintained by the city indicate that over twenty percent (20%) of the dwelling units that are not permanently occupied are used as transient private home rental units. The remainder of the vacant dwelling units are maintained as vacation homes or offered as long-term rentals. Due to the large number of vacant dwelling units, the prohibition against second units on residential lots will not limit housing opportunities in the city. 
In addition, the 2002 Housing Element indicated that for the 2000—2005 planning period, residential development in the city had already exceeded the regional housing needs allocation for the city as determined by the Southern California Association of Governments. Therefore, adequate housing is still being constructed to meet the housing demand of new residents in the city, without the creation of second units on residential lots. 
Finally, the city has provided opportunities for accessory dwelling units in all commercial land use designations of the general plan, up to a maximum of three units per parcel based on the general plan density, in order to encourage mixed use development and alternative housing such as live-work spaces. In addition, the city has designated areas for multiple family residential development in excess of the amount needed to provide anticipated housing needs. Therefore, the city has provided ample opportunities to meet housing demand without the use of second units. 
2.  Adverse impacts on the public health, safety, and welfare would result from allowing second units within single-family and multifamily zoned areas, because the city has documented evidence that second units on single-family lots have been and will be used as transient private home rentals for short-term vacation rental purposes rather than for meeting the housing needs of low to moderate income households. Because Big Bear Lake is a recreation resort community attracting over five million visitors each year for winter and summer sports activities, there is a high demand for vacation lodging. To meet this need, the city has allowed the use of single-family residential units as transient private home rentals since 1991, as provided for and regulated by Section 17.03.310 of this Development Code. As of 2003, there are over one thousand two hundred (1,200) dwelling units in the city registered as transient private home rental units. The city receives numerous requests from homeowners wishing to establish a second dwelling unit on a single-family residential lot for short-term vacation rental purposes, in order to generate income from their property. Allowing second units on single-family residential lots could potentially double the density of residential units within existing neighborhoods for the purpose of creating additional short-term vacation rental units, resulting in an increased burden on infrastructure systems including local streets, trash collection, sewer and water systems, but without increasing housing opportunities. In addition, the doubling of residential density for purposes of facilitating establishment of short-term vacation rental units will increase adverse impacts to existing residential neighborhoods, including traffic, noise, and disruption from transient occupants. Finally, the increased use of residential neighborhoods for transient private home rentals may have an adverse impact on the local tourist-based economy by increasing competition with commercial lodging establishments from residential property owners operating multiple vacation rental units.

17.25.220 - Development and performance standards for ancillary uses within commercial lodging facilities and bed and breakfast establishments. 
For the purposes of this section, ancillary use shall mean a use that is clearly incidental and subordinate to a principal use, which shall not cause intensification of the principal use, and which shall not be operated independently of the principal use. Ancillary uses may occur within a building, such as a meeting room, conference room, sunroom, recreation or game room, or dining room; or out-of-doors, such as a pool, spa, patio, deck, gazebo, landscaped or hardscaped area, lawn or garden. For the purpose of this section, any tent, canopy, or similar temporary structure erected over an outdoor space shall comply with the codes and ordinances applicable to enclosed structures and buildings. The following standards and regulations shall apply to uses that are ancillary to bed and breakfast establishments in the residential-low (R-L) and single-family residential (R-1) zones; and to commercial lodges and bed and breakfast establishments within the multiple family residential (R-3) zone on properties of up to one acre in size. Existing or proposed bed and breakfast establishments and commercial lodging facilities located on properties that are greater than one acre in size shall be required to comply with the general Development Code regulations; building, fire and health and safety code regulations, cumulative parking requirements for all uses on the property, and provisions to attenuate noise impacts associated with large facilities and larger ancillary uses.

In compliance with the California Building Code, permanent restroom facilities shall be provided to serve the ancillary use. Portable or temporary restrooms shall not be used to fulfill this requirement. 
5.  Ancillary uses may be advertised as part of the bed and breakfast establishment's or commercial lodging facility's permitted sign. 
6.  In no event shall a bed and breakfast establishment or commercial lodging operator operate an ancillary use out-of-doors between the hours of nine p.m. and seven a.m. 
7.  The operation or playing of any device which reproduces, produces, or amplifies sound is prohibited in the outdoor areas of the property, but may be allowed within a building or enclosed tent. Amplified noise or sound, including public address systems and live or recorded music, shall be prohibited after nine p.m. No bed and breakfast establishment or commercial lodging facility operator shall operate or permit the operation or playing of any device which reproduces, produces, or amplifies sound in such a manner as to be unreasonably loud, excessive, raucous or disturbing, but in no event shall noise exceed fifty-five (55) decibels (dBs, slow scale) as measured from the property line for a period exceeding ten (10) minutes. 
8.  On-site parking shall be provided for the primary use and all ancillary uses occurring on the property pursuant to Table 17.35.070.A Parking Requirements in Commercial and Public Zones as listed for "hotels." As determined by the planning commission, stacked parking in conjunction with a valet service may be considered. In no case shall off site shuttled parking be allowed. 
B.  Meeting and Conference Room Space and Maximum Occupancy of Ancillary Use Areas. 
1.  The maximum square footage of meeting and conference rooms shall not exceed a total of one thousand (1,000) square feet in area and shall be determined by the applicable parking standards and by all development standards contained in Table 17.25.050.A. 
2.  In the residential-low (R-L) or single-family residential (R-1) zone, in no case shall the cumulative total number of people on the property containing a bed and breakfast establishment exceed sixteen (16) people. 
3.  In the multiple family residential (R-3) zone, where the property containing a bed and breakfast establishment or commercial lodging facility is one acre or less in size, the cumulative total number of people on the property shall not exceed forty-nine (49) people. 
4.  In the multiple family residential (R-3) zone, where the property containing a bed and breakfast establishment or commercial lodging facility is greater than one acre in size, a cumulative total maximum number of people shall not be established by this section, but shall be dependent upon complying with all applicable codes and ordinances to accommodate the people and parking on the property. 
5.  In no event shall a meeting or conference room be converted to or used as a separate public dining facility. This provision is not intended to prohibit catered meals to be brought in for meetings, conferences or outdoor gatherings. 
C.  Dining Facilities.

E.  Frequency of Outdoor Ancillary Uses. 
1.  Outdoor ancillary uses shall not occur more than two times per calendar month. An occurrence is determined to be one outdoor ancillary use of the property. As an example, where an outdoor ancillary use is held on Saturday at noon and another also on Saturday at six p.m., this shall constitute two occurrences. Likewise, an occurrence on a Saturday and another on Sunday, shall constitute two occurrences. Outdoor ancillary uses shall not occur on consecutive weekends. 
2.  In order to monitor the frequency of outdoor ancillary uses, each occurrence shall be reported to the city planning department at least thirty (30) days prior to the occurrence. A registry of the occurrences shall be created which will be made available to the general public in electronic and/or paper form. This registry shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following information: the address where the ancillary use is occurring, the type of ancillary uses and the hours of ancillary use. 
F.  Location of Outdoor Ancillary Uses. 
1.  Outdoor ancillary uses shall not occur in front of the primary structure on the property, meaning the area between the street or public right-of-way and the structure or building. Areas used for ancillary outdoor uses shall be located to the rear or side of the primary structure on the property in order to retain the residential character of the property as visible from the public right-of-way. 
2.  Structures, equipment and other items used in conjunction with outdoor ancillary uses, including, but not limited to tents, canopies, stages, arches, dance floors, tables, chairs, serving stations, shall not be placed within any required building setback area.

The area considered as open space shall be landscaped or natural undisturbed vegetation. Paved surfaces shall not be considered towards meeting the open space requirement. 
2.  If rear yard and side yard areas are used for outdoor ancillary uses, then the perimeter of the rear yard and side yard areas shall be fenced with a six-foot high visually obscuring fencing material. 
3.  Parking spaces provided on the property for the bed and breakfast establishment or commercial lodging facility shall not be located within the required building setback areas. No more than one-half of the required parking spaces shall be located in front of the primary structure on the property, meaning the area between the street or public right-of-way and the structure or building and all other parking shall be located to the rear of the primary structure on the property in order to retain the residential character of the property as visible from the public right-of-way. 
H.  Operational Requirements. 
1.  The business owner or a full-time on-site manager shall be on the premises at all times when an ancillary use is occurring. 
2.  Adequate security measures shall be implemented at all times when an ancillary use is occurring. Security measures may include, but are not limited to, providing security personnel. 
3.  Adequate parking control measures shall be implemented at all times when an ancillary use is occurring. Parking control measures may include, but are not limited to, providing a valet parking service and/or providing parking attendants to direct vehicles to on-site parking spaces.

Chapter 17.35 - COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC ZONES 
Sections: 
 
17.35.010 - Intent and purpose of commercial and public zones. 
A.  The commercial and public zones are established to implement the goals and policies of the City of Big Bear Lake General Plan, including but not limited to the following: 
Goal L 2—Adopt land use and development policies which encourage growth and diversification of the city's economic base. 
Goal L 4—Provide sufficient commercially-designated land to accommodate the city's long-term needs for tourist and recreational facilities, to support the city's role as a market center for the Big Bear Valley, and to provide services to city residents. 
Policy L 4.2—Ensure that commercial development provides an attractive environment for business, lodging, entertainment, shopping, and working, and creates long-term value for the community. 
Policy L 4.3—Adopt regulations for location, design and operation of commercial uses which, by the intensity of the proposed use or potential secondary land use effects, may have special requirements. 
Goal L 5—Provide opportunities for industrial activities needed to support the local economy and recognize existing industrial uses in the city, while ensuring that impacts from industrial uses do not detract from the city's character as a mountain resort through adverse visual, traffic, noise, dust or other impacts. 
Goal P 6—Plan for and reserve land to accommodate uses needed for public benefit, including open space, recreation, public improvements, schools, and community facilities. 
Policy PS 1.1—Assure the provision of adequate public services and facilities for all residents, businesses and visitors within the community, now and in the future. 
B.  In addition to implementing the goals and policies of the general plan with respect to commercial and public land uses, this chapter and the accompanying official zoning map are intended to achieve the following objectives: 
1.  To reserve appropriately located areas for commercial uses of various ranges of types and intensities, including office uses, retail stores, service establishments, and light industrial uses to meet the needs of the community; 
2.  To ensure adequate access for each business, including access by pedestrians, bicycles, and public transit, and minimize traffic congestion through concentration of businesses within districts and appropriate site design; 
3.  To ensure that each site is designed with adequate area to accommodate all required on-site parking, open space, screening, setbacks, service areas, and landscaping; 
4.  To create visitor-oriented districts where commercial lodging, dining and entertainment are located together for ease of accessibility and convenience of visitors, and which are protected from incompatible uses; 
5.  To protect adjacent properties from incompatible uses, light, glare, odors, visual blight, and other objectionable conditions resulting from uses having a higher intensity; 
6.  To facilitate the provision of utility services and other public facilities commensurate with anticipated service requirements; 
7.  To promote design and construction techniques that complement the natural resources and topography of Big Bear Lake's mountain setting and that encourage energy and water conservation, through high-quality site planning, architecture, and landscaping; 
8.  To ensure that public projects are held to the same standards of development as similar privately-developed projects, and that such projects are designed, constructed, maintained and operated so as to minimize adverse effects on surrounding properties.

(Ord. No. 2011-415, § 4(Exh. 1), 8-22-2011; Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011)  
17.35.020 - Commercial and public zone districts. 
Six base zone districts are established as follows: 
A.  Commercial-Services (C-1) Zone. 
1.  The commercial-services (C-1) zone is established for the development of professional/administrative offices, personal services, institutional and quasi-public uses serving both a local and community-wide market area. The number of customer visits would typically be less frequent and traffic generation more moderate than for retail commercial uses. Site development regulations and performance standards are designed to make businesses in this zone compatible with adjacent less-intensive uses, including residential districts. 
2.  The C-1 zone is appropriate between more intensive commercial districts or highways, and residential uses. This district should be accessible from collector or arterial streets, and be relatively flat and free from environmental constraints. Suitable sites for this zone will contain adequate area to accommodate all required parking, loading, circulation and landscape requirements, and be supported by adequate infrastructure. 
3.  The C-1 zone is compatible with the commercial-services (CS) general plan land use designation. 
B.  Commercial-General (C-2) Zone. 
1.  The commercial-general (C-2) zone is established for the development of businesses that provide a wide variety of goods and services serving both a local and regional market area. The zone is appropriate for shopping centers as well as freestanding businesses. The intent of this zone is to create a pleasant and efficient environment for general retail shopping and business. 
2.  The C-2 zone is appropriately located in areas that are or will be occupied by stores and businesses that provide retail sales and services for a wide range of consumer needs, including both short-term and long-term goods. The area should be located along or accessible from major streets and highways, environmentally and topographically suited to large-scale commercial development, with slopes of under ten percent (10%) and with adequate infrastructure to support permitted uses. 
3.  The C-2 zone is compatible with the commercial-general (CG) general plan land use designation. 
C.  Commercial-Visitor (C-3) Zone. 
1.  The commercial-visitor (C-3) zone is established for the development of areas designed primarily for visitor services, including lodging, dining, recreation, entertainment, specialty retail stores, and other supporting uses. 
2.  The C-3 zone is appropriately located in areas that are or will be occupied by stores and businesses, which provide services to visitors. The area should be located along or accessible from major streets and highways or adjacent to recreation areas, with adequate infrastructure to support permitted uses. 
3.  The C-3 zone is compatible with the commercial-visitor (CV) general plan land use designation. 
D.  Commercial-Recreation (C-4) Zone. 
1.  The commercial-recreation (C-4) zone is established for the development of destination-oriented recreational facilities serving a regional market area and supportive uses, including ski resorts, marinas, golf courses, snow play facilities, and similar uses. Supportive uses include visitor services, such as lodging, restaurants, specialty retail, and related off-site parking lots. 
2.  The C-4 zone is appropriately located in areas that are or will be occupied by major recreational facilities drawing large numbers of visitors. The district should be accessible from major streets and highways, and may be designated on or adjacent to natural features providing recreational opportunities, such as the mountains or lake. Adequate infrastructure should be available to support permitted uses, and operations in this zone should be conducted so as to have no detrimental effect on adjacent properties or on the environment. 
3.  The C-4 zone is compatible with the commercial-recreation (C-R) general plan land use designation. 
E.  Commercial-Industrial (C-5) Zone. 
1.  The commercial-industrial (C-5) zone is established for the development of the most intensive businesses serving a community and regional market area, including construction-related businesses, storage, heavy vehicle repair, equipment storage and rental, light fabrication and assembly of goods, waste management facilities, and utility yards. Establishments in this zone serve both other businesses and the general public with a combination of intensive commercial and light industrial uses. 
2.  The C-5 zone is appropriately located in areas that are or will be occupied by businesses that provide heavy commercial and light industrial goods and services to other businesses as well as the general public. The district should be located along or accessible from major streets and highways, on relatively flat land with adequate infrastructure to support permitted uses. Businesses in this zone may use or store hazardous materials and heavy equipment, and may generate noise, dust, emissions, and truck traffic which may be detrimental to less intensive uses; therefore, the use is not appropriate next to residential uses unless adequate separations and buffers are provided. Adequate infrastructure should be available to support permitted uses, and operations in this zone should be conducted so as to have no significant adverse effect on adjacent properties or on the environment. 
3.  The C-5 zone is compatible with the industrial (Ind) general plan land use designation. 
F.  Public (P) Zone. 
1.  The public (P) zone is established to create and preserve areas for public facilities, including but not limited to schools; government administrative facilities; law enforcement and fire stations; libraries; park, recreation, and open space uses; community facilities; public works facilities; utilities; and similar uses needed to serve the needs of the general public. 
2.  The P zone is appropriate in areas occupied or planned for public or quasi-public uses or facilities, which can physically accommodate the use and where adequate services exist to serve the intended use. 
3.  The P zone is compatible with the public facilities (P) general plan land use designation. In addition, due to the broad service function of this zone and the difficulty of planning all publicly-needed facilities in advance, the P zone may be designated throughout the planning area, provided the use does not conflict with other established uses and conforms to applicable provisions of the general plan.

(Ord. 2004-344 § 4 (Exh. 2 (part)), 2004: Ord. 2003-333 § 4 (Exh. A (part)), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2011-415, § 4(Exh. 1), 8-22-2011; Ord. No. 2011-417, § 4(Exh. A), 12-12-2011; Ord. No. 2018-461, § 4(Exh. 1.B.), 5-14-2018)  
17.35.060 - Additional setback regulations. 
A.  General Setback Provisions. 
1.  Each lot or parcel of commercially-zoned land shall have minimum front, side, and rear yard setbacks as required for the zone in which the property is located, for the specific use when applicable, or by this section, whichever requirement is the greatest, except as modified by an adopted specific plan or development agreement. The reviewing authority may require setbacks greater than the minimum requirement in order to meet the goals and policies of the general plan, including but not limited to minimizing grading, tree removal, degradation of sensitive habitat, land use impacts, or other similar objectives. 
2.  In a case where a final tract map, final parcel map, or composite development plan has been recorded that indicates minimum setback requirements less than those set forth in this chapter, the setback requirements of this chapter shall apply. In a case where a final tract map, parcel map, or composite development plan has been approved or recorded that indicates setback requirements in excess of those set forth in this chapter, the greater standard shall apply. 
3.  Setbacks from streets shall be measured from the public or private right-of-way, to the nearest edge of the building. 
B.  Permitted Projections into Required Setbacks. The following projections into yards are permitted, provided that the applicable requirements of the California Building Code are also met: 
1.  Eaves, awnings, cornices, chimneys, wing walls, bay windows without floor area, or other similar architectural features attached to the main building and supported at or behind the building setback line, may project into any required yard a maximum of three feet, except that in no case may such features encroach closer than thirty (30) inches to the property line. Bay windows exceeding twelve (12) feet in width or fifty percent (50%) or more of the width of the wall on which they are located must conform to the setback requirements for the main structure. 
2.  Uncovered decks, balconies, platforms, porches, landings, and walkways which do not exceed a height of forty-eight (48) inches above grade may encroach into any required side or rear yard, but not closer than three feet to the property line and not closer than ten (10) feet from any residentially used or designated property. 
3.  Stairways and walkways providing access to the main entrance of any building may be permitted in any front or street side yard, provided that no portion of said stairway or walkway other than required handrails may exceed eighteen (18) inches in height as measured from original grade. 
4.  Uncovered bridges or platforms providing access to required parking areas and main entries may be permitted in the front or street side setback areas, providing that no portion of said bridge or platform other than required handrails may exceed eighteen (18) inches in height as measured from the grade of the edge of right-of-way. 
5.  Open and unenclosed fire escapes, stairways and door stoops may encroach by not more than three feet into a rear or interior side yard, provided that they are no closer than three feet from the property line; these features may not project into required front or street side yards. 
6.  Planter boxes or masonry planters, not to exceed a height of forty-two (42) inches, may project into the required front or street side yard setback by no more than six feet. 
7.  Fireplace structures not wider than eight feet may encroach into required yards up to two feet, but no closer than three feet to the property line. 
C.  Special Setback Requirements. 
1.  Sexually oriented uses shall maintain setbacks from other uses pursuant to Chapter 5.98 of the Big Bear Lake Municipal Code. 
2.  Gasoline tanks, fuel storage tanks, or any other storage of explosives or hazardous material shall be set back no less than one hundred (100) feet for underground tanks and three hundred (300) feet for above-ground tanks from any residentially used or designated property; day care center; school; hospital; or social care facility.

17.35.070 - Parking requirements and standards. 
A.  General parking requirements for commercial and applicable public uses. 
1.  Off-street parking shall be provided for any new building constructed and for any new uses established, for any addition or enlargement of an existing building or use, and for any change in the occupancy of a building or the manner in which any use is conducted, that would result in additional parking spaces being required, pursuant to the requirements in Table 17.35.070.A and the provisions of this section. This section shall not apply to properties that are located within a city-approved parking lot district or similar offsite parking agreement. 
2.  All required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use to be served, except as otherwise permitted through approval of off-site parking facilities. The reviewing authority may approve off-site parking if the following conditions are met by the project: 
a.  The proposed off-site parking shall be located within three hundred (300) feet of the use for which it is provided, and there is a continuous approved pedestrian access connecting the off-site parking area with the use. 
b.  Clearly visible directional signage shall be provided to direct vehicles and pedestrians between the off-site parking lot and the use being served. 
c.  Disabled access and parking shall be provided on the same site as the use, and shall meet all other applicable requirements. 
d.  No more than fifty percent (50%) of the required parking shall be provided off-site, except where existing structures preclude the provision of on-site parking. 
3.  All parking spaces and areas required by this chapter shall be designed and maintained to be fully usable for the duration of the use requiring such areas and spaces. Where off-site parking is permitted to meet the required parking, all off-site spaces shall be designated for the use and secured through property ownership, long-term lease, or other means as approved by the city to guarantee that the parking shall be provided for the duration of the use. 
4.  The required parking is cumulative for all of the uses proposed on the same lot, except as otherwise approved through a shared parking plan or as allowed by Table 17.35.070.A. A shared parking plan may be approved by the reviewing authority based upon submittal and approval of a parking study prepared by a qualified traffic engineer to justify the provision of a lesser number of spaces than that required by this section, based on shared use of spaces, the nature of the use, or other factors. A written agreement shall be approved by all parties and the city and shall be recorded, assuring the continued availability of the parking spaces designated for joint use. 
5.  No existing use of land or existing structure where parking for said use or structure was conforming at the time of establishment or modification, shall be deemed to be nonconforming solely because of the lack of off-street parking facilities prescribed by this section. Facilities being used for off-street parking may be reduced in capacity to the minimum standards prescribed in this chapter to provide for landscaping and snow storage. 
6.  Except as otherwise specified in Table 17.35.050.A, required setback areas shall not be used for off-street parking purposes. Vehicle parking shall be allowed only within designated parking spaces. 
7.  Where the application of the off-street parking requirements results in a fractional number of spaces, a fraction of one-half or greater shall be rounded to the next higher whole number, and a fraction of less than one-half shall not be counted. 
8.  The off-street parking requirements contained in this section are minimums for the listed uses. If evidence before the reviewing authority shows that a specific application will result in a higher demand for parking than is normally expected for that type of use, a greater number of spaces may be required. 
9.  Temporary use of required parking spaces for non-parking purposes is permitted through approval of a special event permit or temporary use permit, pursuant to Chapter 17.03. 
10.  Parking of abandoned, unlicensed, or inoperative vehicles is subject to and will be abated pursuant to applicable provisions of the Big Bear Lake Municipal Code and the California Vehicle Code. 
11.  Pedestrian walkways shall be designated and clearly delineated between parking areas and structures. The parking area shall be designed to minimize the need for pedestrians to cross parking aisles or landscaped areas in order to reach their destinations. 
12.  A minimum of one loading space shall be provided for every building having five thousand (5,000) or more square feet, except as otherwise approved by the reviewing authority based upon the nature of the use. Where required for truck deliveries, a loading space shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet wide and twenty-four (24) feet long and shall not be located within the main parking area used by the general public. For uses, which typically receive all deliveries by van, a loading space may be striped with the same dimensions as a parking space, but shall be required in addition to the required number of parking spaces. 
13.  The parking requirement for any use not specifically listed shall be determined by the city planner on the basis of the requirements for similar uses. 
B.  Design Standards for Parking Areas. The following parking lot standards shall apply to all commercial uses, and to public uses where applicable: 
1.  Parking facilities constructed or substantially reconstructed after the effective date of this chapter shall conform to the design standards set forth herein, whether or not the parking is required. 
2.  Internal circulation patterns, and location and operations of all access drives, shall be designed and maintained in accordance with accepted principles of traffic engineering and traffic safety. All driveways, which serve as fire lanes, shall conform to the fire code. 
3.  Driveways and drive aisles shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet in width for one-way traffic, and twenty-four (24) feet for two-way traffic, except as otherwise approved by the city to minimize grading and/or tree removal. In no case shall a two-way drive aisle be less than twenty (20) feet in width. When in conformance with the fire code, drive aisle width for one-way drive aisles shall be provided as follows: 
Parking Angle 

in Degrees 	Aisle Width— 

One-Way Traffic 
30 	12 ft. 
45 	14 ft. 
60 	18 ft. 
90 	24 ft. 
 
4.  Head-in or diagonal parking spaces shall be no less than nine feet in width and nineteen (19) feet in length; parallel parking spaces shall have minimum dimensions of ten (10) feet by twenty-four (24) feet. Minimum vertical clearance for parking spaces shall be fifteen (15) feet. No reduction in these dimensions shall be permitted. 
5.  Parking with access for disabled persons shall be provided in accordance with state law. Each parking space designated for use by the handicapped shall consist of a rectangular area not less than seventeen (17) feet wide by nineteen (19) feet long for a van-accessible stall, and fourteen (14) feet wide by nineteen (19) feet long for a standard stall, and shall be located in an area not exceeding two percent slope. All spaces shall be located near or convenient to a level or ramped entrance, not exceeding a five percent slope, to the facility served by the parking space. Parking spaces for the handicapped shall be signed, striped, and restricted for use by the handicapped only, and all signs and striping shall be maintained in a good condition at all times. 
6.  Except for parallel parking spaces, when the side of a parking space abuts a building, wall, support column, or other obstruction, which interferes with access to the vehicle, the space shall be a minimum of two feet wider than the required minimum width. 
7.  Parking lots, loading spaces and driveways shall be constructed with three inches of asphalt paving over four inches of aggregate base, except as otherwise approved by the city engineer based upon the recommendations of an approved soils study provided by a qualified soils engineer. Alternate surface material may be considered if it is shown that such material will not cause adverse effects and that it will remain in a usable condition. 
8.  Parking areas shall be graded and provided with permanent storm drainage facilities. Surfacing, curbing, and drainage improvements shall be sufficient to preclude free flow of water onto adjacent properties or public streets and to preclude standing pools of water within the parking facility. 
9.  The maximum grade of parking lots shall not exceed five percent. The maximum grade of driveways serving parking lots shall not exceed ten percent (10%). 
10.  Each parking space shall be individually accessible; tandem parking is not allowed in commercial zones, except for special events or circumstances where attendants park vehicles pursuant to an approved parking plan. 
11.  Parking lots shall be designed so that vehicles do not have to exit the site to get from one parking space to another. Design shall ensure that no vehicle must back into a public right-of-way to maneuver into or out of the site. 
12.  Parking lots shall be designed in consideration of existing trees on the site, in conformance with Chapter 17.10. Existing trees over six inches DBH shall be preserved to the extent practicable in the design of parking lots. Within lots having six or more parking spaces, trees shall be provided at a ratio of one tree per six parking spaces, which may include existing trees to be preserved on site or newly planted trees, provided that any such trees counted to meet this requirement must be located within ten (10) feet of the parking area. 
13.  In parking lots where headlights from vehicles will shine into adjacent residentially used or designated property or commercial lodging units, screening of headlight glare shall be provided which may include but not be limited to screen walls, berms, landscape planting, or a combination thereof. 
14.  For parking lots with six or more spaces, at least five percent of the parking area shall be landscaped. The parking area shall be computed by adding the areas used for access drives, aisles, stalls, maneuvering and landscaping within that portion of the premises that is devoted to vehicular parking and circulation. Any planter area containing trees shall be no less than five feet in width, excluding paving. 
15.  Where the side of a parking space abuts a landscaped planter, a minimum twelve (12) inch wide paved landing strip shall be provided adjacent to the parking space to accommodate passengers exiting the vehicle. 
16.  Except as otherwise approved through a snow management plan, parking lots shall be designed to accommodate snow plowing and snow storage. An area equal to a minimum of five percent of all uncovered required parking and driveway areas shall be provided on site for the storage of snow. All designated snow storage areas shall be at least ten (10) feet wide and deep in the smallest dimension and shall be readily accessible and usable. These areas shall be unpaved and shall be substantially free and clear of obstructions (including but not limited to propane tanks, trees, boulders, and dumpsters). No parking may be permitted in snow storage areas, and parking spaces on site may not be designated for snow storage. Storage of snow on adjacent properties is not permitted, except where property is under same ownership. Snow storage area may be combined with required landscape area, provided that plant materials will not be damaged by plowing operations. 
17.  No wheel stops or raised curbs shall be located within parking areas in such a way as to obstruct or interfere with snowplowing operations. 
18.  All parking areas shall be maintained in good condition at all times, free from potholes and excessive cracking, with required pavement striping and handicapped parking identification clearly visible. 
19.  In the event practical difficulties and hardships result from the strict enforcement of the parking standards due to existing permanent buildings or an irregularly shaped parcel, the city planner may grant a minor deviation to the standards with respect to a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) reduction to on-site parking spaces, or minor reconfiguration of existing parking to comply with accessibility requirements, pursuant to Section 17.03.180 of the Development Code. All other requests to deviate from parking standards must be approved through the variance procedure pursuant to said section.

17.35.080 - Site design standards. 
A.  Grading and Clearing. 
1.  Except for minor landscaping improvements or weed removal, no lot may be graded or vegetation cleared until such action is shown on and consistent with an approved development plan or permit, which may include subdivision map, use permit, grading permit, and/or encroachment permit. Grading should be limited to the extent feasible to accommodate a building footprint for structures, parking, access, landscaping, and snow storage. 
2.  Existing trees and vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. No live trees over six inches DBH shall be removed without prior approval, as required by Chapter 17.10, and replacement trees may be required by the reviewing authority. 
3.  Development should relate to the natural surroundings and follow natural contours as much as possible. Graded slopes should be rounded and contoured to blend with the existing terrain. Split-level pads, built-up foundations, stepped footings, and similar techniques should be used in areas of moderate to steep gradient. Grading should be designed to complement the project's orientation, scale, height, design, and transition with surrounding properties. 
B.  Site Access. 
1.  Direct access shall be provided to and from a public right-of-way, as approved by the city engineer and in conformance with the fire code. Approved access shall not include the use of private easements over adjacent lots, except where a reciprocal parking and access easement has been approved and recorded. 
2.  Vehicular access to commercial development shall not be provided through a residential neighborhood; except that when a gated emergency access is required for fire access, such access may be approved by the reviewing authority to exit into a residential area provided that no adverse impacts would result. 
3.  Shared vehicular and pedestrian access is encouraged between adjacent commercial sites to the extent feasible, to allow customers to access various businesses without exiting onto adjacent rights-of-way. 
4.  Pedestrian access shall be integrated into all commercial and public developments open to the general public, which may include but not be limited to the following improvements: 
a.  Transit stops should be connected to buildings by pedestrian walkways; 
b.  Public sidewalks within adjacent rights-of-way should be connected to buildings by pedestrian walkways; 
c.  Parking areas should be connected to buildings by clearly delineated pedestrian walkways; 
d.  Pedestrian walkways should be protected from snow shedding and rainwater dripping off eaves;
