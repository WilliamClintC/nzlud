This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of La Palma, California. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as updated by ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council through July 2, 2013. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as updated, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
RELATED LAWS 	RL:1 
SPECIAL ACTS 	SA:1 
CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE 	CHTCT:1 
RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE 	RLCT:1 
SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE 	SACT:1

CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, and Jimmy L. Charlton Jr., Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Laurie A. Murray, CMC, Administrative Services Manager/City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

SECTION 2: CONTINUATION OF EXISTING LAW. The recodification and adoption of the La Palma City Code is intended by the City Council to be a continuation of existing ordinances and nothing is intended to modify or enact any new taxes. To the extent the provisions of the 2013 Edition of the La Palma City Code are substantively the same as existing law, the provisions of the La Palma City Code (2013 edition) shall be considered a continuation of existing law and not new enactments.

Sec. 2-351. Infraction penalty. 
(a) Except in cases where a different punishment is specifically prescribed elsewhere in this Code, every violation determined to be an infraction is punishable by:

SECTION 9: SEVERABILITY. If any section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Ordinance is, for any reason, held to be invalid by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Ordinance. The City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted this Ordinance and each, section subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Ordinance irrespective of the fact that one or more sections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses, phrases, or portions of this Ordinance be declared invalid. 
SECTION 10: PROCEDURAL COMPLIANCE. All required proceedings and considerations precedent to the adoption of this Ordinance have been regularly taken in accordance with applicable law. 
SECTION 11: PUBLICATION. The City Clerk is authorized and directed to publish this Ordinance or a summary thereof in the manner provided by law and in accordance with procedures normally taken.

(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier, meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement, may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may:

(2)  Provide appropriate section headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement and make changes in section headings, titles for sections and headings for other subdivisions of the Code;

The inserted section numbers will indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code; and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

It shall be unlawful for any person in the City to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever except pursuant to ordinance or other official act of the City Council which will cause the law of the City to be misrepresented thereby.

The City Council may, on refusal of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award it to the next most responsive bidder. If the City Council awards the contract to the next most responsive bidder, the amount of the first most responsive bidder's security shall be applied by the City to the contract price differential between the first most responsive bid and the second most responsive bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the first most responsive bidder. 
(3)  Bid opening procedure. Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notices or as soon thereafter as possible. The date and time bids are received shall be marked on the envelope. Bids received after the deadline established in the notices inviting bids shall be returned to the bidder unopened.

(5)  Tie bids. If two or more bids received are the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay of readvertising for bids, the City Council may at its discretion accept the one it chooses or accept the lowest bid made by one of the bidders, after negotiation with the bidders that are tied at the time of the bid opening. 
(6)  Performance bonds. The City Manager shall have authority to require a performance bond before entering into a contract or approving a purchase order in such amount as it shall find reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the City.

Payments of administrative fines shall be sent to the City's finance department. 
(c)  No waiver. Under no circumstances shall the payment of the fine designated in the administrative citation constitute a waiver of the offender's right to an administrative hearing.

(d)  Obligation to correct violation. Nothing in this Code shall be interpreted to mean that because an offender has paid the fine that he, she or it is not required to correct the City ordinance violation. Failure to correct the City ordinance violation may result in additional citations. 
(Code 1975, § 3-14; Ord. No. 2004-02, § 3)

(1)  The Community Development Director or any other person designated by the City Council ("hearing officer") shall conduct the administrative hearing and hear all facts and testimony presented and deemed appropriate. 
(2)  Any person designated to serve as a hearing officer is subject to disqualification for bias, prejudice, interest, or for any other reason for which a judge may be disqualified pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 170.1. The offender may challenge the hearing officer's impartiality by filing a statement with the City Manager objecting to the administrative hearing before the hearing officer and setting forth the grounds for disqualification. The question of disqualification shall be heard and determined in writing by the City Manager within ten days following the date on which the disqualification statement is filed. 
(e)  Administrative hearing procedures. 
(1)  The administrative hearing is intended to be informal in nature. Formal rules of the California Evidence Code and discovery shall not apply, except that irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded at the hearing officer's discretion. 
(2)  Each party shall have the opportunity to offer testimony and evidence and cross-examine witnesses in support of his or her case.

a.  Comply with the hearing officer's order including paying the administrative fine in full within 20 calendar days of service of the administrative order; or 
b.  Seek judicial review of the administrative order pursuant to section 2-386. 
(g)  Failure to attend administrative hearing. 
(1)  Penalty. If the offender requests an administrative hearing and fails to attend, the penalty in section 2-387 shall immediately be in effect if the offender has not paid the fine and 21 days has passed since the administrative citation was issued. If the offender fails to appear at the administrative hearing and 21 days from date the administrative citation was issued has not passed, the offender has until the end of the 21-day period to pay the administrative fine before the penalty in section 2-387 comes into effect. 
(2)  Waiver of right to hearing. The offender's failure to appear at the administrative hearing shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. An offender's failure to appear at the administrative hearing shall be presumed an admission of guilt to the City ordinance violation charges as indicated on the administrative citation. 
(3)  Good cause. Upon a showing of good cause by the offender, the hearing officer may excuse the offender's failure to appear at the administrative hearing and reschedule the hearing. Under no circumstances shall the administrative hearing be rescheduled more than one time unless the offender pays a deposit in the amount of the administrative fine. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to mean the offender is excused from the requirement of paying the administrative fine or appearing at an administrative hearing.

(2)  File a petition for a writ of mandate pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 et seq. 
(Code 1975, § 3-16; Ord. No. 2004-02, § 3)

The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit plans and pay a new plan check fee.

R109.5 Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. 
This subsection is not to be interpreted as requiring re-inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or reinspection. 
Reinspection fees may be assessed when the inspection record card is not posted or otherwise made available on the work site, the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official. 
To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall file an application therefore in writing upon a form furnished for that purpose and pay the re-inspection fee as established by the City Council Fee Resolution. 
In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

The Temporary Certificate of Occupancy expires 30 days after issuance and may be renewed for additional 30 day periods upon providing acceptable justification, the payment of a new application fee for each 30 day period and approval by the Building Official. The violation or failure of any such condition imposed shall be grounds for revocation of such Temporary Certificate of Occupancy.

Said members shall hold their respective membership on said board of appeals by reason of, and concurrently with their terms of service as Council members and shall cease to be such members upon their ceasing to be Council members. The building official shall be the secretary of the board. The board may adopt reasonable rules and regulations for conducting its investigations and shall render all its decisions and findings on contested matters in writing to the building official, with duplicative copy thereof to any appellant or contestant affected by any such decision of finding.

(a)  A nonexclusive franchise to install, construct, operate, and maintain a CATV system on streets within all or a specific portion of the City may be granted by the Council to any person, whether or not operating under an existing franchise, who or which offers to furnish and provide such system under and pursuant to the terms and provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  When and in the event that the grantee of any franchise granted hereunder uses in its CATV system distribution channels furnished to the grantee by a telephone company pursuant to tariff or contract on file with a regulatory body having jurisdiction, and such grantee makes no use of the streets independent of such telephone-company furnished facilities, such grantee shall be required to comply with all of the provisions of this chapter as a "licensee," and in such event, whenever the term "grantee" is used in this chapter, it means and includes "licensee." No provision of this chapter shall be deemed or construed as requiring the granting of a franchise hereunder to a telephone company furnishing such a channel service. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-2; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1)  
Sec. 12-3. - Uses permitted to grantee. 
Any franchise granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall authorize and permit the grantee to engage in the business of operating and providing a CATV system within all or a specific portion of the City, and for that purpose to erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain and retain in, on, under, upon, across, and along any public street, such wires, cable, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, attachments, and other property as may be necessary and appurtenant to the CATV system; and, in addition, so to use, operate and provide similar facilities or properties rented or leased from other persons, firms or corporations, including but not limited to any public utility or other grantee franchised or permitted to do business in the City. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-3; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1)  
Sec. 12-4. - Limitations of franchise. 
(a)  Every franchise granted under this chapter shall be nonexclusive. Neither the granting of any franchise under this chapter nor any of the provisions contained in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the City from granting any identical or similar franchise to any other person, firm or corporation within all or any portion of the City. 
(b)  No privilege or exemption shall be granted or conferred by any franchise granted under this chapter except those specifically prescribed in this chapter. 
(c)  Any privilege claimed under any such franchise by the grantee in any public street or other public property shall be subordinate to any prior or subsequent lawful occupancy or use thereof by the City or any other governmental entity, and shall be subordinate to any easements therein, whether created prior or subsequent to the granting of any franchise hereunder. 
(d)  Any such franchise shall be a privilege to be held in personal trust by the original grantee. It cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, without the prior consent of the Council expressed by resolution, after receipt of any proposed contractual documents directly related to the franchise, and then only under such conditions as may in such resolution be prescribed. Any such transfer or assignment shall be made only by an instrument in writing, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk within 30 days after any such transfer or assignment. The consent of the Council, except as to assignment or transfers as specified in section 12-9, may not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, the proposed assignee must show financial responsibility and must agree to comply with all provisions of this chapter and of the franchise; and provided further, that no consent shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or other hypothecation to secure an indebtedness unless it shall have been made to avoid or evade the other provisions of this chapter affecting transfers. Consistent with applicable law, a request for Council consent must be accompanied with a fee reasonably determined by the Council to recover City expenses connected with processing the change. 
(e)  Grantee shall promptly notify the City of any proposed change in control of the grantee. Such change in control shall make the franchise null and void unless and until the City shall have consented thereto. Failure of the City to act upon the grantee's notification within 90 days of the receipt by the grantor of all relevant information shall be deemed the City's consent thereto. The City may condition the transfer upon reasonable terms and conditions. For the purposes of this subsection, a presumptive change in control exists, upon the sale or transfer of 20 percent or more in any given year of the grantee's stock, or the cumulative sale of 50 percent or more of the City's stock. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this subsection, stock sales or transfers to: 
(1)  Existing shareholders; 
(2)  Members of families of persons in the foregoing subsection (e)(1); and 
(3)  Trusts for the benefit of persons in the foregoing subsections (e)(1) and (2); 
shall not require consent under the provisions of this section or be counted in determining percentages under the provisions of this subsection. In addition, a presumptive change in control will exist when the grantee causes a change in the identity of the managing agent (operator) of the grantee's system; provided, that if the existing managing agent (operator) is terminated for cause, consent for such termination shall not be required but consent shall be required for the selection of a new managing agent (operator). 
(f)  Time shall be of the essence of any such franchise granted hereunder. The grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply promptly with any of the provisions of this chapter or by any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance. 
(g)  Any right or power in, or duty impressed upon, any officer, employee, department or board of the City shall be subject to transfer by the City to any other officer, employee, department or board of the City. 
(h)  The grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this chapter or of any franchise issued hereunder or because of its enforcement. 
(i)  The grantee shall be subject to all requirements of City ordinances, rules, regulations and specifications heretofore or hereafter enacted or established to protect the public safety and general welfare and/or which apply generally to persons or businesses in the community, and shall comply with all applicable State and federal laws and regulations heretofore or hereafter enacted or established. 
(j)  Any such franchise shall not relieve the grantee of any obligation involved in obtaining pole space from any department of the City, utility company, or from others maintaining poles in the streets. 
(k)  Any franchise granted hereunder shall be in lieu of any and all other rights, privileges, powers, immunities, and authorities owned, possessed, controlled or exercisable by the grantee, or any successor to any interest of the grantee, or pertaining to the construction, operation, or maintenance of any CATV system in the City; and the acceptance of any franchise hereunder shall operate, as between a grantee and the City, as an abandonment of any and all of such rights, privileges, powers, immunities, and authorities within the City, to the effect that, as between the grantee and the City, any and all construction, operation and maintenance by any grantee of any CATV system in the City shall be, and shall be deemed and construed in all instances and respects to be, under and pursuant to such franchise, and not under or pursuant to any other right, privilege, power, immunity or authority whatsoever. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-4; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1; Ord. No. 88-02, § 1(b))  
Sec. 12-5. - Rights reserved to the City. 
(a)  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to impair or affect, in any way, to any extent, the right of the City to acquire the property of a grantee, either by a mutually agreed purchase or through the exercise of the right of eminent domain, at the then fair market value, and nothing in this chapter contained shall be construed to contract away or to modify or abridge, either for a term or in perpetuity, the City's right of eminent domain. 
(b)  In the event the City desires to acquire all or a part of the CATV system (acquisition of part of the CATV system is restricted to those portions of the system, which if owned by the City, would not substantially undermine the economic viability of the remainder of the system), fair market value shall include consideration of the cable television system as a going concern. 
(c)  In the event of purchase by the City, or a change of the grantee, the current grantee shall cooperate with the City, or with a representative appointed by the City, to operate the system for a temporary period in maintaining continuity of service. 
(d)  There is reserved to the City every right and power which is required to be in this chapter reserved or provided by any ordinance of the City, and a grantee, by its acceptance of any franchise, agrees to be bound thereby and to comply with any action or requirements of the City in its exercise of such rights or power heretofore or hereafter enacted or established. 
(e)  Neither the granting of any franchise under this chapter nor any of the provisions contained in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the City from granting any identical or similar franchise to any other person, firm or corporation within all or any portion of the City. 
(f)  There is reserved to the City the power to amend any section or part of this chapter so as to require additional or greater standards of construction, operation or maintenance or otherwise, on the part of a grantee. Such additional or greater standards shall apply only to additions to existing systems of a grantee unless mutually agreed to by the City and a grantee or as dictated by the public safety and welfare. 
(g)  Neither the granting of any franchise nor any provision hereof shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power of the City, now existing or hereafter granted. 
(h)  The Council may do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this chapter and may determine any question of fact which may arise during the existence of any franchise granted hereunder. The City Manager is authorized and empowered to adjust, settle, or compromise any controversy or charge arising from the operations of any grantee under this chapter, either on behalf of the City, the grantee, or any subscriber, in the best interest of the public. Either the grantee or any member of the public who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the City Manager may appeal the matter to the Council for hearing and determination. The Council may accept, reject, or modify the decision of the City Manager, and the Council may adjust, settle, or compromise any controversy or cancel any charge arising from the operations of any grantee or from any provision of the chapter. All actions by the Council under this section shall be after hearing, upon ten days' advance written notice to the grantee at its address on file with the City. Such actions may be by either resolution or minute order, except that revocation of a franchise pursuant to section 12-9 shall be by ordinance. 
(i)  The City reserves the right, in special circumstances, to construct such portion of a grantee's proposed facilities and equipment as public safety and convenience may dictate, at the grantee's sole expense. 
(j)  The City reserves the right to remove any portion of a grantee's equipment and facilities as may be required in any emergency, as determined by the City, without liability for interruption of service, and the City shall not be obligated to restore service or to pay the costs of expenses of restoring service. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-5; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1; Ord. No. 88-02, § 1(e))  
Sec. 12-6. - Incorporation by reference. 
This chapter shall be incorporated by reference in any franchise award, and any and every provision hereof shall be incorporated as though the same were set out in full, except for those provisions of the award which expressly alter or modify this chapter, and all provisions shall be binding upon the grantee. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-7; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1)  
Sec. 12-7. - Minimum standards. 
(a)  Any and all CATV systems for the City shall be designed and installed to meet all of the standards set forth in the franchise agreement. 
(b)  It is the City's desire that the CATV system be a State-of-the-art system and include an operational institutional network when it is technologically and economically feasible. The grantee shall make every reasonable effort to develop such institutional services and provide them as a part of the CATV system within the above-stated constraints. When requested by the City, and not more than annually, the grantee shall submit to the City a report concerning the State-of-the-art with regard to institutional networks and the grantee's ability to provide and market the same. Such institutional services shall be provided by the grantee when such services are being provided by the grantee: 
(1)  As a part of other comparable cable television franchises in Southern California on a nonexperimental basis; or 
(2)  As a part of any cable television system for which the City's system is a line extension. 
(c)  As part of its proposal to the City, the franchise applicant shall indicate a proposed construction schedule for the completion of the installation of the cable television system throughout the entire City, or the portion thereof for which a franchise is being requested. Service to the areas prescribed in that proposal or as modified in the franchise agreement shall be provided within the periods stated, and failure on the part of the grantee to complete each of the matters set forth therein shall be grounds for termination of the franchise, as well as invocation of the penalties prescribed in sections 12-11 and 12-22 and any other penalties specified in this chapter or in the franchise agreement. The proposed construction schedule shall not, in any event, exceed two years, except that by resolution the Council, in its discretion, may extend the time for the commencement and completion of installation and construction for additional periods in the event the grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reason of circumstances beyond its control. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-8; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1)  
Sec. 12-8. - Duration of franchise. 
(a)  No franchise granted by the Council under this chapter shall be for a term longer than 15 years following the date of acceptance of such franchise, or the renewal thereof, by the grantee. Any such franchise shall terminate in whole if the City acquires the CATV system, or proportionately if the City acquires a portion thereof. 
(b)  Any such franchise granted hereunder may be terminated prior to its date of expiration by the Council in the event that: 
(1)  The City acquires the CATV system property of the grantee; 
(2)  The grantee has failed to comply with any material provision of this chapter or has by act or omission violated any material term or condition of any franchise or permit issued hereunder; or 
(3)  The application of the grantee, including accompanying reports or data, contains a material misrepresentation, whether intentional or not. 
(c)  The City Manager shall make written demand that the grantee comply with any such term or condition of the franchise or permit issued thereunder. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such written demand, the City Manager may place his or her request for termination of the franchise upon the next regular Council meeting agenda. The City Manager shall cause to be served upon such grantee, at least ten days prior to the date of such Council meeting, a written notice of his or her intent to request such termination and the reason therefor, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the City Clerk at least once ten days before such meeting in the newspaper utilized by the City for publication of its public hearing notices and other legal notices. 
(d)  The Council shall consider the request of the City Manager and shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall determine whether or not the failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause. 
(e)  If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause, the Council shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable. 
(f)  If the Council finds there has been such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee, the Council may declare that the franchise is terminated and forfeited. The Council may impose any other remedy it deems appropriate unless there is compliance by the grantee within such periods as the Council may fix. 
(g)  A franchise granted hereunder shall, at the option of the Council, cease and terminate 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take over and conduct the business of the grantee whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such receivership shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of the 120 days, or unless: 
(1)  Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivers or trustees within such 120 days shall have remedied all defaults under the franchise; and 
(2)  Such receivers or trustees shall, within such 120 days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision, and limitation of the franchise granted under this chapter. 
(h)  In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of a grantee, or any part thereof, including or excluding its franchise, the Council may serve notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee thereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after service of such notice, unless: 
(1)  The Council shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as and in the manner provided in this chapter; and 
(2)  Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the City to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-9; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1)  
Sec. 12-9. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  Any grantee granted a franchise under this chapter shall pay to the City, during the life of such franchise, a franchise fee equal to five percent of the grantee's annual gross receipts. If, during any part of the franchise term, there is in effect a federal or State limit regulating the franchise fee percentage to a different amount, the maximum rate allowed thereby shall apply, but only to the extent required by law and only for that time period such limit is legally operational. Franchise fee payment by the grantee to the City shall be made quarterly by delivery of the same to the City Clerk not later than April 15, July 15, October 15, and January 15 for the preceding quarter. 
(b)  The grantee shall file with the City Clerk, within 90 days after the expiration of the grantee's fiscal year or portion thereof during which such franchise is in force, a statement showing in detail the annual gross receipts, as defined in this chapter, of the grantee during the preceding fiscal year, or portion thereof. It shall be the duty of the grantee to pay to the City, within 15 days after the time for filing such statement, any unpaid balance thereof for the fiscal year or portion thereof covered by such statements. 
(c)  The City shall have the right to inspect and audit a grantee's fiscal records. If an independent audit of a grantee's records directed by the City shows a franchise fee error in excess of two percent in the City's favor, the grantee shall assume all reasonable costs for the audit. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further additional sums payable under this section or for the performance of any other obligation under this chapter. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-10; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1; Ord. No. 88-02, § 1(d))  
Sec. 12-11. - Permits, installation and service. 
(a)  Within 60 days after acceptance of a franchise, the grantee shall apply for and proceed with due diligence to obtain all necessary permits and authorizations which are required in the conduct of its business, including but not limited to, any utility joint use attachment agreements, microwave carrier licenses, and any other permits, licenses and authorizations to be granted by duly constituted regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the operation of CATV systems, or their associated microwave transmission facilities. 
(b)  Within 180 days after obtaining all necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the grantee shall commence construction and installation of the CATV system. 
(c)  Within 90 days after the commencement of construction and installation of the system, the grantee shall proceed to render service to subscribers, and the completion of the construction and installation shall be pursued with reasonable diligence thereafter, so that service to all areas designated on the map accompanying the application for franchise or as modified in the franchise agreement shall be provided within one year from the date on which service was first provided. 
(d)  For failure either to apply for all necessary permits and approvals or to commence construction in accordance with this section, unless the Council approves the delay because of reasons beyond the control of the grantee, the franchise term shall be reduced four days for each day of delay. 
(e)  For failure to begin service to subscribers or complete construction and installation of the system as provided for in this section, or as provided for in the grantee's proposal to the City and adopted or amended in the franchise agreement, unless the Council approves the delay because of reasons beyond the control of the grantee, the franchise term shall be reduced four days for each day of delay. 
(f)  By acceptance of the franchise granted hereunder, the grantee agrees that, in the event of its failure to comply with any time requirements referred to in subsections (a) through (e) of this section, or as may be extended by the Council, in addition to the liquidated damages provisions specified elsewhere in this chapter, the grantee will pay to the City the sum of $1,000.00, or such other amount as set forth in the franchise agreement, per day for each and every day's delay beyond the time prescribed, plus authorized extensions therefor, for completion of any of the acts required to be done by this section. 
(g)  Any requests for extensions of the proposed construction deadlines proposed by a grantee, due to acts of God, acts of the public enemy, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, lockouts, freight embargoes, unusually severe weather, or from any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the grantee and/or its employees, agents, or contractors, must be submitted to the City Manager in writing within 14 days after the cause for such delay first occurs. Such request must specify the exact reason for the delay and the total number of extension days requested. Whenever and wherever possible, such requests for extensions of the proposed or required construction deadlines should be supported with written justification of the cause for such delay, such as newspaper articles, letters from vendors, agents, contractors, etc. Within 14 days of receipt of such a request, the City Manager will reply in writing, approving, partially approving, or denying the request. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-11; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1)  
Sec. 12-12. - Location of property of grantee. 
(a)  Any wires, cable lines, conduits, or other properties of a grantee to be constructed or installed in streets shall be so constructed or installed only at such locations and in such manner as shall be approved by the City Engineer acting in the exercise of his or her reasonable discretion within the general guidelines of CATV construction standards approved by the Council. 
(b)  A grantee shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other facilities whenever possible and shall not install or erect any facilities or apparatus in or on other public property, places or rights-of-way, or within any privately owned area within the City which has not yet become a public street but is designated or delineated as a proposed public street on any tentative subdivision map approved by the City, except those installed or erected upon public utility facilities then existing, without obtaining the prior written approval of the City Engineer. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter or any franchise granted pursuant thereto, all facilities of a grantee in any public street or in any public or private easement, and services lines to subscribers off the main lines, shall be located underground at such depths and locations as required by the City Engineer, except where a grantee uses existing poles, with permission from the owner, and as to such service lines where and so long as electric and telephone lines to the subscribers are overhead. Upon the undergrounding of the utility lines of the owner using such poles, the grantee shall concurrently (or earlier) place its facilities underground at depths and locations approved by the City Engineer at no expense to the City or to the customer. All underground wires or cables of a grantee shall be placed in conduits. 
(d)  Amplifiers in a grantee's underground transmission and distribution lines shall be in appropriate low profile housing, and at locations as approved by the City Engineer. 
(e)  All transmission lines, equipment and structures shall be so installed and located as to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners and at all times shall be kept and maintained in a safe, adequate and substantial condition and in good order and repair. A grantee shall, at all times, employ ordinary care and shall install and maintain in use, commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failure and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries or nuisances to the public. Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares or other devices shall be used at such times and places as are reasonably required for the safety of all members of the public. Any poles or other fixtures placed in the public right-of-way by a grantee shall be placed in such a manner so as not to interfere with the usual travel on such public right-of-way. 
(f)  The grantee shall use boring augur techniques in lieu of transverse cuts for crossing arterial streets and driveways. Exceptions may be authorized by the City Engineer when conditions such as street contours, utilities or other factors make boring techniques impractical. If any paved surface is disturbed during the construction or installation of CATV facilities, the surface shall be replaced by the grantee in conformance with the City's specifications. 
(g)  The grantee shall not place any transmission lines or fixtures where the same will interfere with any gas, electric or telephone fixtures, water hydrant or main, and all such transmission lines or fixtures placed in any street shall be placed within the areas specified by the City Engineer, and those placed in alleys shall be placed close to the line of the lot abutting on such alley, and then in such manner as not to interfere with the usual travel on such streets, alleys and public ways. 
(h)  The grantee shall make every reasonable effort during the course of construction to maintain all streets, driveways, sidewalks and other paved surfaces in a usable condition. 
(i)  The grantee shall perform all backfilling and return property to original condition within 24 hours except by specified written approval of the City Engineer. 
(j)  All landscaped public and private areas shall be returned to a condition as existed prior to the construction work, and the grantee shall maintain such area until, in the opinion of the City Engineer, the plant materials are reestablished. 
(k)  The grantee shall not remove any tree or trim any portion, either above, at, or below ground level, or any tree within any public place without the prior consent of the City. The City shall have the right to do the work with the actual cost thereof to be paid by the grantee. If such trimming is not performed by City, the grantee shall be responsible for any and all damages to any tree as a result of trimming, or to the land surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or removed. 
(l)  Any grantee awarded a franchise within the City agrees to the City's acceptance and approval of any and all subcontracting firms employed by the grantee within the City. Such acceptance and approval by the City shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(m)  In the event the City determines that any subcontractor employed by the grantee is performing unsatisfactory or inferior work, as determined by the City Engineer, or is the cause of numerous citizens' complaints, the City Manager shall notify the grantee in writing of such determination and the grantee shall, within 30 days of such notice, correct such problem with the subcontractor. If such problems are not corrected within 30 days, then grantee shall employ another subcontractor that meets the provisions of this subsection. If the City invokes its rights hereunder regarding any subcontractor employed by the grantee, then the grantee shall be given an extension on any construction deadlines for 30 additional days from the date of receipt of written notification of any such action by the City. 
(n)  The grantee shall notify the City at least ten days prior to the intention of the grantee to commence any construction in any streets. The City shall cooperate with the grantee in issuing any permits required, provided such grant and subsequent construction by the grantee shall not unduly interfere with the use of such streets and that proposed construction shall be done in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the ordinances of the City.

Sec. 12-13. - Removal and abandonment of property of grantee. 
(a)  In the event that the use of any part of the CATV system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of 12 months, or in the event such system or property has been installed in any street or public place without complying with the requirements of the grantee's franchise or this chapter, or the franchise has been terminated, cancelled or has expired, the grantee shall promptly, upon being given 30 days' written notice, initiate removal from the streets or public places all such property of such system other than any which the City Engineer may permit to be abandoned in place. In the event of such removal, the grantee shall promptly restore the street or other area from which such property has been removed to a condition satisfactory to the City Engineer. 
(b)  Any such property of the grantee on public property or in the public rights-of-way remaining in place 180 days after the termination or expiration of the franchise shall be considered permanently abandoned. The City Engineer may extend such time not to exceed an additional 60 days. 
(c)  Any such property of the grantee to be abandoned in place shall be abandoned in such manner as the City Engineer shall prescribe. Upon permanent abandonment of the property of the grantee in place, the property shall become that of the City, and the grantee shall submit to the City Engineer an instrument in writing, to be approved by the City Attorney, transferring to the City the ownership within the provisions of any utility joint-use attachment agreements.

The grantee shall from time to time protect, support, dislocate, temporarily or permanently as may be required, remove or relocate, without expense to the City or any other government entity, any facilities installed, used, and maintained under the franchise if and when made necessary by any lawful change of grade, alignment, or width of any public street, including the construction of any storm drain, sewer, subway or viaduct, by the City or any other government entity, or made necessary by any other governmental entity, or made necessary by any other public improvement or alteration in, under, on, upon or about any public street or the public property, whether such public improvements or alteration is at the instance of the City or another governmental entity, and whether such improvement or alteration is for a governmental or proprietary function, or made necessary by traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation or any other public project or purpose of City or any other governmental entity. The decision of the City Engineer under this section shall be final and binding on the grantee. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-14; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1)  
Sec. 12-15. - Failure to perform street work. 
Upon failure of the grantee to commence, pursue, or complete any work required by law or by the provisions of this chapter or by its franchise to be done in any street or other public place within the time prescribed, and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, the City may, at its option, cause such work to be done and the grantee shall pay to the City the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the City Engineer, to the grantee within ten days after receipt of such itemized report. In the alternative, at the City's option, the City may demand of grantee the estimated cost of such work as estimated by the City Engineer, and such shall be paid by grantee to the City within ten days of such demand. Upon award of any contract or contracts therefor, the grantee shall pay to the City within ten days of demand any additional amount necessary to provide for cost of such work. Upon completion of such work, the grantee shall pay to the City or the City shall refund to the grantee such sums so that the total received and retained by the City shall equal the cost of such work. The term "cost," as used in this section, includes 15 percent of other costs for the City's overhead. 
(Code 1975, § 7A-15; Ord. No. 86-14, § 1)  
Sec. 12-16. - Security for performance. 
(a)  In order to secure the faithful performance of each and all of its obligations under and pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, concurrently with the filing and acceptance of award of a franchise granted hereunder, the grantee shall deposit with the City Clerk cash, a negotiable certificate of deposit payable to the City, and/or a letter of credit in an aggregate amount equal to $1,000,000.00, or such other amount as may be specified in the franchise agreement.

The granting of consent for a transfer in one instance will not render unnecessary approval of any subsequent transfer. 
(2)  The requirements of subsection (g)(1) of this section shall apply to any change in control of grantee. The word "control," as used herein, includes ownership interest of 35 percent or more, and actual working control in whatever manner exercised. In the event that grantee is a corporation, prior consent of the Council shall be required where ownership or control of more than 35 percent of the ownership or voting stock of the grantee, or grantee's immediate, intermediate or ultimate parent is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own or control the voting stock of the grantee as of the effective date of the franchise, singularly or collectively. 
(3)  The grantee shall notify the grantor in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or a substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be considered by the grantor as notice that a change in control or ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing the consent of the grantor to such change in control or ownership shall apply. 
(4)  The grantee shall promptly notify the grantor of any proposed transfer. If any transfer should take place without prior notice to the grantor, grantee shall promptly notify the grantor that such a transfer has occurred. At least 120 calendar days before the contemplated effective date of a transfer, grantee will submit to the grantor application (hereinafter "application") for approving the transfer. Such application will provide the required complete information on the proposed transaction. 
(5)  The following information must be included in the application, provided that grantee is not required to duplicate information that it submits to the grantor to comply with its obligations under applicable law. No application shall be considered complete until all required information is received by the grantor.

b.  All information required in this section for franchise grants, renewals, modifications or transfers; 
c.  A detailed statement of the corporate or other business entity organization and management structure of the proposed transferee, together with an explanation of how decisions regarding the cable system will be made if the proposed transaction is approved;

h.  Legal, technical and financial qualifications of the prospective transferee. 
(6)  The grantor may require grantee, or any prospective transferee, to provide additional information as it may deem necessary to determine whether the transfer is in the public interest and should be approved, denied or conditioned. The grantee and any prospective transferees shall assist the grantor in any such inquiry and provide information requested. Failure to do so may result in the request for transfer being denied. 
(7)  In determining whether to grant, deny or grant subject to conditions an application for a transfer of a franchise, the grantor's consideration may include, but is not necessarily limited to: 
a.  The legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable system; 
b.  Any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates or services; 
c.  Whether the incumbent grantee is in compliance with its franchise and applicable law and, if not, the proposed transferee's written commitment to cure such noncompliance; 
d.  Whether the transferee owns or controls any other cable system in the service area and whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of the cable service in the service area; and 
e.  Whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would adversely affect subscribers, the public or the grantor's interest in the cable system and/or franchise. 
(8)  Any transfer without the grantor's prior written approval constitutes a material breach of a franchise and will make a franchise subject to revocation and to any other remedies available under the franchise or applicable law, except where a request for approval or sale is subject to a deadline for action under 47 USC 537 and the grantor fails to act by the time required under 47 USC 537. 
(9)  The grantor shall not approve a transfer request unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of the cable franchise grant and applicable law and that the transferee will assume the obligations, liabilities and responsibility for all acts and omissions of the previous grantee under the franchise grant and applicable law for all purposes, including renewal, unless the grantor, in its sole discretion, expressly waives this requirement in whole or in part. 
(10)  Any submission of an application for transfer of a franchise shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable franchise processing fee in the amount of $5,000.00 per proposed transfer. Upon transfer, grantee shall reimburse the grantor for the grantor's processing and review expenses in connection with the transfer of the franchise including, without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication costs and document preparation expenses.

(i)  Nonexclusive franchise. Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable system, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable law. 
(j)  Multiple franchises. 
(1)  The grantor may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable law. The grantor may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as: 
a.  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage; 
b.  The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service; 
c.  The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations of the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  The grantor may require that any new entrant, nonincumbent grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith, if, in the grantor's opinion, the public rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasibly accommodate additional cables. 
(k)  Franchise modification. The grantee may be required to pay any costs incurred by the grantor in processing a grantee request for franchise modification. Upon written request from the grantee, the grantor shall provide grantee with an estimate of the total processing costs prior to entering into the review of the request. Such costs shall be paid by the grantee prior to final consideration of the request by the grantor.

(3)  The grantee shall be deemed to have responded to a request for service under the provisions of this section when a technician arrives at the service location and begins work on the problem. In the case of a subscriber not being home when the technician arrives, the technician shall leave written notification of arrival.

(4)  In case of a billing dispute, the grantee shall respond to a written complaint from a subscriber within 30 days. Pending resolution of the billing dispute, grantee shall exercise care to ensure that no termination or late charge notices are issued for the disputed portions of the bill. 
(5)  Credits or refunds shall automatically be provided by grantee on a pro rata basis to any subscribers affected by interruption of service for more than three hours due to actions or outages under the control of the grantee, exclusive of scheduled repairs, maintenance or franchise-required construction that grantee has provided advance written notice of to subscribers. In cases where advance written notice is provided to subscribers, the time period detailed in said notice shall not exceed six hours in any 24-hour period. In cases where said notice has been given to subscribers and the service interruption exceeds the period detailed in said notice, the provisions of this section shall apply. 
(6)  In the event grantee has improperly or inadvertently disconnected cable services to a subscriber, grantee shall provide for restoration without charge to subscriber as soon as possible, but no later than within two days of discovery of disconnection. The grantee shall credit or provide refunds to any subscriber improperly or inadvertently disconnected from receiving cable services for the period of time without cable service. 
(7)  All credits or refunds for service shall be issued no later than the customer's next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted. For subscribers terminating service, refunds shall be issued promptly, but no later than 30 days after the return of any grantee-supplied equipment. 
(8)  The grantee shall provide written information on each of the following areas:

(9)  Upon the initial provision of cable service to any subscriber, grantee shall prorate the first invoice for cable service to reflect, to the extent appropriate, any partial billing period due to the introduction of service at a time other than the initiation of a billing cycle. 
(10)  Upon the initial provision of cable service to any subscriber, grantee shall provide a written notice to the subscriber containing substantially the following information: 
"Subscriber understands that the Company uses public rights-of-way and other facilities of the City of La Palma in providing service and that this continued use cannot be guaranteed. Subscriber agrees not to make any claims against the City of La Palma or its officers or employees in the event that such use is denied for any reason, and Company is unable, in its discretion, to provide service over alternate routes." 
(11)  Subscribers and the grantor shall be notified of any changes in rates, programming services or channel positions as soon as possible in writing and in accordance with applicable law. Notice must be given to subscribers and the grantor a minimum of 30 days in advance of such changes if the change is within the control of the grantee. In addition, grantee shall notify subscribers and the grantor 30 days in advance of any significant changes in the information required in subsection (c)(8) of this section. 
(d)  Verification of compliance with standards. 
(1)  Upon ten days' prior written notice, grantee shall respond to a request for information made by the grantor regarding grantee's compliance with any or all of the standards required in subsections (a) through (c) of this section. The grantee shall provide sufficient documentation related solely to the franchise area to permit the grantor to verify grantee's compliance within the franchise area. 
(2)  A repeated and verifiable pattern of noncompliance with the consumer protection standards of subsections (a) through (c) of this section, after grantee's receipt of due notice and not less than a ten-day opportunity to cure, shall be deemed a material breach of the franchise agreement. 
(3)  The grantor, pursuant to subsection (a)(8) of this section, may require grantee to acquire equipment to determine compliance with the telephone answering standards of this section on a franchise-by-franchise basis. Should grantee have its own telephone equipment which can report on telephone line usage, the grantee, upon written request from the grantor, shall submit such report from its own system in order to verify compliance with the telephone answering standards of this section. 
(4)  The grantee shall take necessary steps to ensure that adequate telephone lines and/or staffing are available to permit grantee to satisfy its obligations under this chapter and the franchise. Consideration shall be given for periods of promotional activities or outages. The monthly billing period shall be considered as a normal, daily activity for purposes of determining the availability of adequate telephone lines and/or staffing. 
(e)  Subscriber complaints and disputes. 
(1)  The grantee shall establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by the grantor. The written procedures shall prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint either orally or in writing, specifying the subscriber's grounds for dissatisfaction. The grantee shall file a copy of these procedures with the grantor. The written procedures shall include a requirement that grantee respond to any written complaint from a subscriber within 30 days of receipt. 
(2)  Upon prior written request, the grantor shall have the right to review grantee's response to any subscriber complaints in order to determine grantee's compliance with the franchise requirements, subject to the subscriber's right to privacy. 
(3)  Subject to applicable law, it shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving cable service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. In the event that the grantee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or the grantor gives notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise, the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive cable service so long as the franchise remains in force. 
(4)  In the event of a change of control of grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the original grantee shall cooperate with the grantor, new grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system. 
(5)  The grantee response to subscriber complaints, as well as complaints made by subscribers to the grantor and provided by the grantor to grantee, shall be initiated within one business day of receipt by the grantor. The resolution of subscriber complaints shall be effected by grantee not later than three business days after receipt of the complaint, or a longer period if such complaint cannot reasonably be resolved within three business days. Should a grantee supervisor not be available when requested by a subscriber, a supervisor shall respond to the subscriber's complaint at the earliest possible time, and in no event later than the end of the next business day. For complaints received by the grantor and provided by the grantor to grantee, grantee shall notify the grantor of grantee's progress in responding to, and resolving, said complaints. 
(f)  Truth in advertising. 
(1)  Each grantee shall take appropriate steps to ensure that all written promotional materials, announcements, and advertising of cable service to subscribers and the general public, where price information is listed in any manner, clearly and accurately discloses price terms. In the case of telephone orders, a grantee will take appropriate steps to ensure that price terms are clearly and accurately disclosed to potential customers in advance of taking the order. 
(2)  Each grantee will maintain a file available for public inspection containing all notices provided to subscribers under these customer service standards, as well as all promotional offers made to subscribers. The notices and offers will be kept in the file for at least one year from the date of such notice or promotional offer. 
(g)  Other requirements. 
(1)  In the event grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive days other than for reasons beyond the control of grantee, without prior approval or subsequent excuse of the grantor, the grantor may, at its sole option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the grantor or a permanent operator is selected. If the grantor should fulfill this obligation for the grantee, then during such period as the grantor fulfills such obligation, the grantor shall be entitled to collect all revenues from the system, and the grantee shall reimburse the grantor for all costs or damages in excess of the revenues collected by the grantor that are the result of grantee's failure to perform. 
(2)  All officers, agents or employees of grantee or its contractors or subcontractors who, in the normal course of work come into contact with members of the public or who require entry onto subscribers' premises shall carry a company issued photo-identification card. Every vehicle of the grantee or its major subcontractors shall be clearly identified as working for grantee. 
(3)  Additional service standards and standards governing consumer protection and response by grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in this chapter may be established in the franchise agreement or by separate ordinance as permitted by applicable law.

Sec. 12-65. - Construction requirements. 
(a)  System construction. 
(1)  The grantee shall not construct any cable system facilities until grantee has secured the necessary permits from the grantor, or other responsible public agencies. The grantee shall be subject to all permit and bonding requirements applicable to contractors working within the public rights-of-way.

(2)  Prior to performing any work in the public right-of-way, grantee shall give appropriate notice to the "Underground Service Alert" (USA), or any similar type service provider as designated by the grantor. 
(3)  In those areas of the City where transmission lines or distribution facilities of all public utilities providing telephone and electric power service are underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground. 
(4)  In those areas of the City where the grantee's cables are located on the aboveground transmission or distribution facilities of the public and/or municipal utility providing telephone or electric power service, and in the event that the facilities of both the telephone and electric power utilities subsequently are placed underground, then the grantee likewise shall reconstruct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at grantee's sole cost. Certain of grantee's equipment, such as pedestals, amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed above ground, may continue to remain in aboveground enclosures, unless otherwise required by the City. 
(5)  Any changes in or extensions of any poles, anchors, wires, cables, conduits, vaults, laterals or other fixtures and equipment (herein referred to as "structures"), or the construction of any additional structures, in, upon, along, across, under or over the streets, alleys and public ways shall be made under the direction of Public Works Director or a designee, who shall, if the proposed change, extension or construction conforms to the provisions hereof, issue written permits therefor. The height above public thoroughfares of all aerial wires shall conform to the requirements of the California regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof. 
a.  All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by the grantee shall be located so as not to interfere with the proper use of the public rights-of-way, and to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the said public rights-of-way, and not to materially interfere with existing public and municipal utility installations.

If such property or improvement shall within three years (or in the case of street improvement, until the street is resurfaced if resurfaced prior to the expiration of the three years) of the date the restoration was completed, become uneven, unsettled or otherwise require additional restorative work, repair or replacement because of the initial disturbance or damage to the property by the grantee, then the grantee, as soon as reasonably possible, shall, promptly upon receipt of written notice from the grantor and at the grantee's sole cost and expense, restore to the grantor's satisfaction said property or improvement which was disturbed or damaged. Any such restoration by the grantee shall be made in accordance with such materials and specifications as may, from time to time, be established by the grantor. 
c.  If emergency work on the system in the public right-of-way is required, the grantee shall, with all due diligence, seek to obtain any and all required permits, licenses and authorizations within three working days after commencing such emergency work. 
d.  There shall be no obstruction of the public rights-of-way by the grantee in connection with any of the work provided for herein. The grantee shall maintain any barriers, signs and warning signals during any work performed on or about the public rights-of-way or adjacent thereto as may be necessary to reasonably avoid injury or damage to life and property. 
e.  If the City Manager determines that the grantee has created an unsafe condition in the public right-of-way or adjacent thereto, the City Manager shall have the authority to issue a work stoppage order restricting any work by grantee in the public rights-of-way until the unsafe condition has been corrected to the City's reasonable satisfaction. In cases where unsafe conditions are found by the City Manager, the grantor shall correct the condition as soon as possible unless otherwise permitted by the City. 
f.  If the grantor lawfully elects to alter or change the grade or location of any public right-of-way, the grantee shall, upon reasonable notice by the grantor, and in a timely manner, remove, relay and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense. 
g.  The grantee shall not place poles, conduits or other fixtures above or below ground where the same will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone fixtures, sewer, water hydrants or other utility, and all such poles, conduits or other fixtures placed in any street shall be so placed as to comply with all ordinances of the grantor. 
h.  In accordance with applicable law, the grantee or any utility user of the public rights-of-way may be required by the grantor to permit joint use of poles located in the public rights-of-way, insofar as such joint use may be reasonably practicable and upon payment of a reasonable rental fee for such usage. 
i.  The grantee, on request of any person holding a moving permit issued by the grantor, shall temporarily raise or lower its wires or fixtures to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of wires or fixtures shall be paid by the person, unless such person is the City, requesting the same, and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be given not less than five business days' prior written notice to arrange for the temporary wire or equipment changes. 
j.  Subject to provisions of this Code, the grantee shall have the authority to trim any trees or other natural growth overhanging the public rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees or other natural growth from coming in contact with the grantee's wires, cables and other equipment. The grantor may require all trimming of trees and natural growth to be done under its supervision and direction at the expense of the grantee. 
k.  The grantee shall be subject to any and all requirements established by the grantor with regard to the placement and screening of facilities and equipment located in the public rights-of-way. Such requirements may include, but not be limited to, use of landscaping to screen pedestals and cabinets and requiring that construction be flush with the natural grade of the surrounding area. 
l.  The grantee shall use only chalk-based paints to mark the public rights-of-way in connection with the construction or maintenance of the cable system. All paint marks remaining after grantee's clean-up following the completion of the construction or maintenance work must be removed by grantee by means of sandblasting, nontoxic chemicals, water or high-pressure water within 30 days following receipt by grantee of the grantor's written notice requiring such removal. 
(b)  Multiple franchises. If the grantor authorizes or permits another cable system to operate within the municipal limits of the City, grantee shall cooperate with such franchisee to the extent necessary in the event that the installation of such new cable system requires the strengthening of poles, replacing poles, rearranging attachments, placing underground facilities incident to the construction of an additional cable system in the franchise area. The cost of the construction and installation of the new entrant cable system shall, however, be borne by the new cable franchisee.

(1)  Cure the violation and recover the actual cost thereof from the security fund established in the franchise agreement, unless the grantor, in its sole discretion, has provided grantee with additional time to effectuate a cure; 
(2)  Assess against grantee liquidated damages in an amount set forth in the franchise agreement for any such violations if such violation is not cured, or if grantee has not commenced a cure, on a schedule acceptable to the grantor. Such assessment may be withdrawn from the security fund, and shall not constitute a waiver by the grantor of any other right or remedy it may have under the franchise or applicable law, including without limitation, its right to recover from grantee such additional damages, losses, costs and expenses, including actual attorney's fees, as may have been suffered or incurred by the grantor by reason of or arising out of such material breach of the franchise.

(1)  The City Manager shall first notify grantee of the alleged violation in writing by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand correction, or evidence of nonviolation, within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than ten calendar days. If grantee fails to: 
a.  Correct the alleged violation within the time prescribed; or 
b.  Commence correction of the alleged violation within the time prescribed and diligently remedy such alleged violation thereafter; or

the City Manager shall then give, by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, written notice of not less than 15 days of a hearing. Said notice shall set forth in detail each of the violations alleged to have occurred. 
(2)  Subsequent to the hearing, the City Manager shall hear and consider all other relevant evidence, and thereafter render findings and its decision. 
(3)  If the City Manager finds that: 
a.  The grantee has corrected the alleged violation; or 
b.  The grantee has diligently commenced correction of such alleged violation after notice thereof and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy such alleged violation; or 
c.  No material violation has occurred; 
the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. 
(4)  If the City Manager finds that a material violation exists and that grantee: 
a.  Has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner; or 
b.  Has not diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof and is not diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation; 
then the City Manager may impose one or more of the remedies provided in this chapter and the franchise agreement as the City Manager, in his or her discretion, deems appropriate under the circumstances. 
(5)  The grantee may appeal any findings of the City Manager to the City Council. The Council shall schedule a hearing on the issue within 30 days of receipt by the City Manager of grantee's appeal. The hearing will provide grantee with the full opportunity to participate and present evidence. The City Council shall decide the matter de novo based upon the evidence presented to the City Council. 
(c)  Grantor's power to revoke. 
(1)  The grantor may revoke any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter and rescind all rights and privileges associated with it in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default by grantee and a material breach under the franchise: 
a.  If grantee fails to perform any of its material obligations under this chapter or the franchise agreement and continues such failure to perform after receipt of due notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure; 
b.  If grantee fails to provide or maintain in full force and effect the insurance coverage or security fund as required in the franchise agreement;

(4)  If the grantor determines that the grantee has committed a material breach, then the grantor may, in its discretion: 
a.  Declare the franchise revoked and/or any security fund and bonds forfeited; or 
b.  If the material breach is curable by the grantee, direct the grantee to take appropriate remedial action within the time and manner and under the terms and conditions specified by the grantor. 
The termination and forfeiture of the grantee's franchise shall in no way affect any right of the grantor to pursue any remedy under the franchise or any provision of law. 
(d)  Appeal of Council finding. The grantee may appeal any Council finding made pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section to an appropriate court of jurisdiction. The matter shall be heard pursuant to the substantive and procedural standards set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5.

(Code 1975, § 7A-50; Ord. No. 2006-02)  
Sec. 12-72. - Abandonment or removal of franchise property. 
(a)  Abandonment or removal. 
(1)  If the grantee discontinues the use of any of its property within the public rights-of-way for a continuous period of six months, such property shall be deemed to have been abandoned by grantee. Any part of the cable system that is parallel or redundant to other parts of the system and is intended for use only when needed as a backup for the system or a part thereof, shall not be deemed to have been abandoned because of its lack of use. 
(2)  The grantor, upon such reasonable terms as the grantor may lawfully impose, may give grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned aboveground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from the grantor and shall restore to the grantor's satisfaction any affected public right-of-way. In removing its plant, structures, and equipment, grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public rights-of-way in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles, or attachments.

(5)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter, the grantee may abandon any underground franchise property in place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any public utility or other franchise holder. 
(b)  Restoration by the grantor; reimbursement of costs. Upon written notice and upon the failure of the grantee to commence, pursue or complete any work to be done in any public right-of-way required by law or by the provisions of this chapter or the franchise agreement, within the time prescribed and to the satisfaction of the grantor, the grantor may cause the work to be commenced and/or completed. The grantor shall provide to the grantee an itemized work order setting forth in detail the exact nature of the work completed and the supplies used in such work. The grantee shall pay to the grantor the costs for such work no later than 30 days after receipt of the itemized work order. 
(c)  Extended operation and continuity of services. Upon expiration or revocation of the franchise, the grantor shall have the discretion to permit grantee to continue to operate the cable system for an extended period of time. The grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of this chapter as of the effective date of the franchise and the franchise, as existed immediately prior to said expiration or revocation, and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time. It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue to receive all available services provided that financial and other obligations to grantee are honored. The grantee shall use reasonable efforts to provide continuous, uninterrupted service to its subscribers, including operation of the system during transition periods following franchise expiration or termination. 
(d)  Receivership and foreclosure. 
(1)  At the option of the grantor and subject to applicable law, a franchise granted hereunder may be revoked 120 days after appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless: 
a.  The receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated within said 120 days; or 
b.  Such receivers or trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all the defaults under the franchise or provided a plan for the remedy of such defaults which is satisfactory to the grantor; or 
c.  Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, have executed an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise. 
(2)  In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the cable system, in whole or in part, the grantor may serve notice of revocation upon grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, and all rights and privileges of the grantee hereunder shall be revoked 30 days after service of such notice, unless: 
a.  The grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in the manner provided by law; and 
b.  The successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise.

b.  That the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or on the subscribers. 
To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the grantor. Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement so recites. 
(2)  The grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the requirements of this chapter or the franchise agreement by any failure of the grantor on any one or more occasions to require or seek compliance with any such terms or conditions.

Grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable law relating to nondiscrimination. However, nothing in this chapter or the franchise shall limit the right of the grantee to deny service to any household or individual who has a negative credit or service history with the grantee, which may include nonpayment of bills or theft or damage to the grantee's equipment, or who has threatened or assaulted employees of the grantee in the course of their employment. In cases of bad or negative credit, the grantee may require the payment of a deposit. 
(2)  Grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment opportunity requirements of applicable law, as now written or as amended from time to time.

(4)  In the conduct of providing its cable services or in pursuit of any collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, the grantee shall take steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or general citizen's right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the system as such rights are delineated or defined by applicable law. The grantee shall not, without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal authority, utilize the system's interactive two-way equipment or capability, if such equipment or capability exists, for unauthorized personal surveillance of any subscriber or general citizen. 
a.  Except for its own use, or in connection with the provision of cable services or for release of data to the grantor, the grantee shall not permit its system to be used for data collection purposes, nor shall it otherwise collect data which would reveal the commercial product or other preferences or opinions of an individual subscriber, members of their families, or their guests, licensees or employees, unless the grantee shall have received the prior written consent of such subscriber which written consent shall be maintained by the grantee in its files for at least three years. 
b.  In any event, the grantee shall not disclose or permit the release or sale of data on individual subscribers or groups thereof, but may disclose or permit the release or sale of aggregate data only. 
(5)  Grantee shall not disclose individual subscriber preferences, viewing habits, beliefs, philosophy, creeds, or religious beliefs to any third person, firm, agency, governmental unit, or investigating agency without court authority or the prior written consent of the subscriber.

b.  The grantee shall not condition the delivery or receipt of cable services to any subscriber on any such consent. 
c.  A subscriber may revoke, without penalty or cost, any consent previously given by delivering to the grantee in writing a statement of the subscriber's intent to so revoke.

(7)  No cable line, wire amplifier, converter, or other piece of equipment owned by the grantee shall be installed by the grantee in the subscriber's premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any required consent.

(8)  In addition to the requirements above, the grantee shall comply with applicable law regarding subscriber privacy including, but not limited to, Section 631 of the Cable Act (47 USC 551).

Sec. 12-74. - Separability. 
If any provision of this chapter is held by any court or by any federal or State agency of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting with any applicable law now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of applicable law, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that applicable law is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision thereof which had previously been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with applicable law, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on the grantor and the grantee, provided that the grantor shall give the grantee 30 days' written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said provision or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required for the grantee to comply with such provision.

Such appropriation action by the City Council shall enumerate the nature of the emergency, make the emergency appropriation, and appropriate moneys for publicity of said emergency and the situation surrounding such emergency. 
(f)  Annual updating of utility rates.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Hotel. 
(1)  The term "hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes. 
(2)  The term "hotel" includes any hotel, inn, tourist home, or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
(3)  The term "hotel" does not mean any of the following: 
a.  Any hospital, sanitarium, medical clinic, convalescent home, rest home, home for the aged people, foster home, or other similar facility operated for the care or treatment of human beings; 
b.  Any asylum, jail, prison, orphanage or other facility in which human beings are detained and housed under legal restraint; 
c.  Any housing owned or controlled by an educational institution and used exclusively to house students, faculty or other employees, and any fraternity or sorority house or similar facility occupied exclusively by students and employees of such educational institution, and officially recognized or approved by it; 
d.  Any housing operated or used exclusively for religious, charitable or educational purposes by any organization having qualifications for exemption from property taxes under the laws of the State; 
e.  Any housing owned by a governmental agency and used to house its employees or for governmental purposes; any camp as defined in the Labor Code, or other housing furnished by an employer exclusively for employees; 
f.  Any private dwelling house or other individually owned single-family dwelling unit rented only occasionally and incidentally to the normal occupancy by the owner or his or her family, provided that the burden of establishing that the housing or facility is not a hotel as defined herein shall be upon the operator thereof, who shall file with the tax collector such information as the tax collector may require to establish and maintain such status. 
Occupancy means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes. 
Operator means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agency shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this article and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this article by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
Rent means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel, valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
Transient means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired, unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived may be considered. 
(Code 1975, § 8-21; Ord. No. 85-17, § 1)  
Sec. 14-118. - Tax imposed. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of eight percent of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Finance Director may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Finance Director. 
(Code 1975, § 8-22; Ord. No. 85-17, § 1)

(2)  Any federal or State officer or employee when on official business; 
(3)  Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty. 
(b)  No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Finance Director.

Sec. 14-120. - Operator's duties. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this article to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Code 1975, § 8-24; Ord. No. 85-17, § 1)  
Sec. 14-121. - Registration. 
Within 30 days after commencing business, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the Finance Director and obtain from him or her a "transient occupancy registration certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
(1)  The name of the operator; 
(2)  The address of the hotel; 
(3)  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
(4)  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Finance Director for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Finance Director. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Code 1975, § 8-25; Ord. No. 85-17, § 1)  
Sec. 14-122. - Reporting and remitting. 
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the Finance Director, make a return to the Finance Director on forms provided by him or her, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Finance Director. The Finance Director may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax, and he or she may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this article shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Finance Director. 
(Code 1975, § 8-26; Ord. No. 85-17, § 1)

(a)  Original delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this article within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. 
(b)  Continued delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. 
(c)  Fraud. If the Finance Director determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this article is due to fraud, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. 
(d)  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this article shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive or penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
(e)  Penalties merged with tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid.

(a)  If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided in this article, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this article, the Finance Director shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Finance Director shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this article and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this article. 
(b)  In case such determination is made, the Finance Director shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. 
(c)  Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Finance Director for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Finance Director shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. 
(d)  If such application is made, the Finance Director shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. 
(e)  At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. 
(f)  After such hearing the Finance Director shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter given written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken. 
(Code 1975, § 8-28; Ord. No. 85-17, § 1)  
Sec. 14-125. - Appeal. 
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Finance Director with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 15 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known place of address. The findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Code 1975, § 8-29; Ord. No. 85-17, § 1)  
Sec. 14-126. - Records. 
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment of any tax imposed by this article to the City to keep and preserve, for a period of four years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which records the finance officer shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Finance Director. 
(b)  An operator may claim a refund, or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Finance Director that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
(c)  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Finance Director, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Finance Director that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
(d)  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto.

Sec. 14-221. - Description and purpose. 
(a)  This article is enacted solely to raise revenue for the general governmental purposes of the City. The people of La Palma adopt this article in order to maintain the utility users tax that has remained in effect since January 1994. By adopting this article by initiative, the people of La Palma intend to maintain the utility users tax in accordance with Article XIIIC of the California Constitution and Government Code § 53720 et seq. 
(b)  All of the proceeds from the tax imposed by this article shall be placed in the City's General Fund and used for the general governmental purposes and the usual current expenses of the City. The article is urgently required for the preservation of public peace, health and safety for the following reasons: If the City does not continue to collect the utility users tax, revenues to the City will be insufficient to maintain the present level of services to the citizens. The utility users tax is the only tax that is under the City's exclusive control and cannot be reduced or taken away by the County, State, or federal governments. The utility users tax is equitable to all citizens of La Palma since every user of telephone, electricity, gas and cable television utilities and services will share in the utility users tax.

Gas means natural or manufactured gas or any alternative hydrocarbon fuel, including methanol, but shall not include diesel, gasoline or methanol fuel used in conventional internal combustion engines for the propulsion of vehicles or vessels as such terms are defined in the California Vehicle Code. 
Month means a calendar month. 
Nonutility supplier means: 
(1)  An electricity supplier, other than an electrical corporation franchised to serve the City, which generates electrical energy in capacities of at least 50 kilowatts for its own use or for sale to others, including those using cogeneration or fuel cell technologies; or 
(2)  A gas supplier, other than a gas corporation franchised to serve the City, that sells or supplies gas to other users within the City. 
Person means any domestic or foreign corporation, firm, association, syndicate, joint stock company, partnership of any kind, joint venture, club, Massachusetts business or common law trust, society, individuals or groups. 
Service means telephone, gas, electric or cable service actually used by the service user. 
Service supplier means any entity required to collect or self-impose and remit a tax as imposed by this article. 
Service user means a person required to pay a tax imposed by this article. 
Tax Administrator means the Finance Director of the City. 
Telephone corporation, electrical corporation, gas corporation and cable television corporation shall have the same meanings as defined in Sections 234, 218, 222, and 215-5, respectively, of the California Public Utilities Code (Public Utilities Code § 216.4, 218, 222, and 234) except, the terms "electrical corporation" and "gas corporation" shall also be construed to include any municipality or public agency engaged in the selling or supplying of electrical power or gas to a service user.

(1)  Entities defined under the term "telephone corporation, electrical corporation, gas corporation and cable television corporation" in section 14-222, and other public authorities, as defined by the Tax Administrator, shall be exempt from this tax. 
(2)  The City finds that entities which produce more than $25,000.00 per year in sales tax to the City provide a substantial contribution to the revenues needed to provide basic municipal services and accordingly entities which produce more than $25,000.00 a year in sales tax to the City are exempt from the utility taxes. 
(3)  Entities whose property is exempt from taxation pursuant to California Revenue and Taxation Code § 214. 
(b)  The Tax Administrator shall prepare a list of the persons exempt from the provisions of this article by virtue of this section and furnish a copy thereof to each service supplier. 
(c)  The tax imposed by this article shall not apply to charges related to late payments, returned checks and collection charges. 
(Code 1975, § 8-47; Ord. No. 02-01, § 2)

No exemption shall be granted with respect to any tax imposed by this article which is or has been paid by a public agency or where the applicant receives funds from a public agency for the payment of such tax. 
(f)  If an applicant is certified as exempt, the Tax Administrator or his or her written designee shall notify applicant's service supplier, stating the name of the applicant, the address to which such service is being supplied, the account number, if any, and such other information as may be necessary for the service supplier to remove the exempt service user from its tax billing procedure. Upon receipt of such notice, the service supplier shall within 60 days discontinue billing applicant for taxes imposed by this article, except as otherwise provided in this article. 
(g)  Taxes billed by the service supplier to the service user, prior to removing the service user from its billing procedure, shall be collected from the service user and the service user shall pay such taxes to the service supplier. Taxes billed to and paid by the service user between the time that the application for exemption is filed and the service supplier removes the service user from its taxing procedure will not be refunded to the service user. 
(h)  Exemptions certified by the Tax Administrator or his or her written designee shall continue so long as the facts supporting the qualification for exemption shall exist; provided, however, that the exemption shall automatically terminate with any change in the service address or residence of the exempt individual, or assignment of a different account number by the service supplier because of discontinuance or suspension of service at the request of the service user; and provided further, that such individual may nevertheless apply for a new exemption with each change of address or residence. 
(i)  Any service user who has been exempted under this section shall notify the Tax Administrator or his or her written designee within ten days of any change in fact or circumstance which might disqualify said individual from receiving such exemption.

(k)  The Tax Administrator or his or her designee shall review all exemptions every 12 months to ascertain compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(Code 1975, § 8-48; Ord. No. 02-01, § 2)  
Sec. 14-225. - Telephone users tax. 
(a)  There is imposed a tax upon the use of telephone services in the City, other than or by a telephone corporation, on the amounts paid for any intrastate, interstate, international and intercontinental communication services in the City (including telecopier, facsimile or modem services) and using any teletypewriter exchange services in the City or mobile or cellular telephone communications when the owner or lessee of the telephone has a billing address in the City. Interstate calls shall be deemed to include calls to the District of Columbia. The tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of five percent of the total qualified charges made for such services and shall be paid by the person paying for such services. 
(b)  As used in this section, the term "charges" shall not include charges for services paid for by inserting coins in coin-operated telephones except that where such coin-operated service is furnished for a guaranteed amount, the amounts paid under such guarantee plus any fixed monthly or other periodic charge shall be included in the base for computing the amount of tax due; nor shall the term "charges" include charges for any type of service or equipment furnished by a service supplied subject to public utility regulations during any period in which the same or similar services or equipment are also available for sale or lease from persons other than a service supplier subject to public utility regulation; nor shall the term "telephone communication services" include land mobile service or maritime mobile services as defined in Section 2.1 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( 47 CFR 2.1). The term "telephone communication services" refers to that service which provides access to a telephone system and the privilege of telephone quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone stations which are part of such telephone system. The tax imposed by this section is intended to, and does, apply to charges billed to a telephone account having a situs in the City, irrespective of whether a particular communication service originates and/or terminates within the City. 
(c)  The tax imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the person providing the services, or the person receiving payment for such services. The amount of the tax collected in one month shall be remitted by U.S. Mail to the Tax Administrator on or before the last day of the following month; or at the option of the person required to collect and remit the tax, an estimated amount of tax collected, measured by the tax bill in the previous month, shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator on or before the last day of each month. 
(d)  To the extent permitted by law, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the tax imposed under this section shall not be imposed upon any person for using intrastate telephone communication services to the extent that the amounts paid for such services are exempt from or not subject to the tax imposed under Division 2, Part 20 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code (Revenue and Taxation Code § 41001 et seq.), or the tax imposed under Section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code, as interpreted and applied by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States in IRS Revenue Ruling 79-404.

Sec. 14-226. - Electricity users tax.

The tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of five percent of the total qualified charges made for such energy by an electrical corporation franchised to serve the City and shall be paid by the person using the electricity. The tax applicable to electrical energy provided by a nonutility supplier shall be determined by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service user would have incurred if the electricity used had been provided by the electrical corporation franchised by the City. Rate schedules for this purpose shall be available from the City. Nonutility suppliers shall install and maintain an appropriate utility-type metering system which will enable compliance with this section, or may arrange another methodology for applying the tax provided such methodology is acceptable to the Tax Administrator.

For the purpose of this section, a service by mail is complete at the time of deposit in the United States mail. Within 15 days after the date of service, the person addressed may either apply in writing to the Finance Director for a hearing on the assessment or may file a written request that such hearing be waived.

If the Finance Director grants the request for waiver of hearing, the administrative proceedings prescribed by this section shall be deemed exhausted and the City shall have the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the amount of the assessment, plus such penalties and interest as may have accrued thereon as provided by this chapter. 
(d)  Time of hearing; notice. If the person requests a hearing upon the assessment or if the Finance Director denies the request for waiver of hearing, the Finance Director shall cause the matter to be set for hearing before a board of review, as specified in subsection (e) of this section, not later than 90 days after the date of the application, or as the case may be, the date of the Finance Director's denial of the request for waiver of hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed to the person addressed not later than 15 days before the date set for hearing and, if the Finance Director desires said person to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records required to be produced. 
(e)  Administrative hearing. The hearing prescribed by this section shall be before a board of review. The board of review shall be composed of the City Manager, Police Chief, and the Community Services Director, or the duly appointed representative of each. At the hearing the person assessed and the appropriate City representative may submit such evidence relevant to their respective positions. The board of review may require the presentation of additional evidence and may continue the hearing from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. 
(f)  Decision of the board of review. Upon completion of the hearing, the board of review may: 
(1)  Affirm the assessment; 
(2)  Increase the assessment; or 
(3)  Decrease the assessment as the evidence may require; 
but the amount of the assessment shall not be increased unless the claim for the increase is asserted on behalf of the City either before or during the hearing. Written notice of the decision of the board of review shall be given to the person assessed in the same form and in the same manner as the notice of assessment. 
(g)  Exception. Within 15 days from the date of service of the notice of decision of the board of review, the person assessed may file written exceptions to the decision of the board of review, but shall not be required to do so. If the person does not do so, the person shall nevertheless be deemed to have exhausted the administrative proceedings provided by this section. Upon filing of written exceptions, the board of review may either deny the exceptions or modify its decision, as it deems appropriate. If the board of review modifies its decision, it shall cause a written notice of decision as required by subsection (f) of this section, to be given to the person assessed at the time, and in the manner provided therein. If the board of review does not modify its decision within 30 days from the service of said exceptions, the exceptions shall be deemed denied. 
(h)  Effect of delay in administrative proceedings. Failure of the Finance Director to set any hearing within the time prescribed in this section and failure of the board of review to complete any procedure prescribed in this section within the period stated shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken hereunder. 
(i)  Effect of payment of an assessment. Acceptance of any payment upon an assessment, the validity of which has not previously been passed upon by the board of review, shall not preclude the Finance Director from subsequently levying another assessment in any case where the original assessment does not truly reflect the correct tax liability.

After conducting the hearing, the City Manager or his or her designee shall determine either to: 
(1)  Terminate the proceedings by concluding that no nuisance exists that requires emergency abatement; or 
(2)  Declare the property or any part thereof to be a public nuisance requiring emergency abatement and order the emergency abatement of the nuisance in a manner or means specifically set forth in the determination.

(e)  If the property owner does not completely abate the nuisance in a manner and within the time required by the written notice pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and the City Manager has not terminated the emergency abatement proceeding in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, the City Manager may cause the nuisance to be abated on an emergency basis by City forces or private contract.

(2)  During that hearing, the City Council shall determine, among other things, whether the conditions of private property were hazardous or otherwise posed an immediate threat to public health and safety or to public property within the City, and thereby required immediate action, as well as the cost of abatement based upon the report of the City Manager. 
(g)  If the City Council determines that the conditions of the property were hazardous or otherwise posed an immediate threat to public health and safety or to public property within the City and thereby required immediate action, the City Council shall assess the owner of property for the cost of abatement in accordance with section 26-26.

(Code 1975, § 18-23; Ord. No. 87-01, § 1)  
Sec. 28-4. - Public nudity prohibited. 
(a)  Intent. The intent and purpose of this section is to guarantee that the parks, playgrounds, and public rights-of-way owned, operated and/or maintained by the City are operated and maintained for the use, benefit, recreation, and enjoyment of all citizens and residents of the City as well as to eliminate, to the greatest extent possible, the secondary effects associated with the presentation of nudity in adult oriented businesses. The City Council finds that it is both in the public interest and necessary to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare and that said parks, playgrounds, and public rights-of-way be utilized and enjoyed by as many persons as possible; that maximum utilization and enjoyment of said parks, playgrounds, and public rights-of-way can only be obtained through imposition of regulations regarding activities thereon; the appearance of persons utilizing said parks, playgrounds, and public rights-of-way without clothing and with the private parts of their bodies exposed, unreasonably interferes with the rights of all persons to use and enjoy said parks, playgrounds, and public rights-of-way by causing many persons to leave and others not to use said parks, playgrounds, and public rights-of-way; that such conduct and behavior imposes an extraordinary unusual burden on City employees charged with the maintenance of said parks, playgrounds, and public rights-of-way and public safety personnel who are diverted from fulfilling their primary obligation to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public at large; that the presence of persons who are unclothed and exposed to public view in or on public rights-of-way, parks, and playgrounds, or on any private property open to public view from public parks and playgrounds, or other public ways tends to discourage the use and enjoyment of said public parks and public ways of the City, and creates a nuisance and is offensive to members of the public who wish to use and enjoy said public parks, playgrounds, and public rights-of-way, and who are unwillingly exposed to such conduct; that the presentation of nude entertainment in adult oriented businesses results in secondary effects which include the proliferation of prostitution, the increase in sexual assaults, and increase in other crimes; that the prohibition of nudity in adult oriented businesses tends to reduce the existence of such secondary effects; and, based upon the foregoing findings, this section will protect the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(b)  Prohibition of public nudity. It is unlawful for any person to appear, bathe, sunbathe, walk, or be on any public park, playground, or on any other public land, or on any private property open to public view from any playground, park, public place, or public right-of-way, or in any adult oriented business as that term is defined in section 44-195, in such a manner so as to knowingly and intentionally: 
(1)  Expose his or her genitals, pubic hair, natal cleft, perineum, anal region, or pubic hair region; or 
(2)  Appear in any device, costume, or covering which gives the appearance of or simulates the genitals, pubic hair, natal cleft, perineum, anal region, nipple and/or areola of the female breast, or pubic hair region; or 
(3)  Expose the nipples and/or areola of the female breasts except as necessary while engaging in the breast feeding of an infant under the age of two years old; or 
(4)  Allow any person to engage in any of the activities described in subsections (b)(1) through (3) of this section in an adult oriented business when such person has ownership or managerial control over the adult oriented business.

(5)  No individual, corporation, partnership or other legal entity other than the organization authorized to conduct a bingo game and holding a permit therefor, shall hold a financial interest in the conduct of such bingo game. 
(6)  With respect to organizations exempt from payment of the bank and corporation tax by Revenue and Taxation Code § 23701d, all profits derived from a bingo game shall be kept in a special fund or account and shall not be commingled with any other fund or account.

(1)  Players who are physically present at a bingo game may use hand-held, portable card-minding devices, as described in this subsection, to assist in monitoring the numbers or symbols announced by a live caller as those numbers or symbols are called in a live game. Card-minding devices may not be used in connection with any game where a bingo card may be sold or distributed after the start of the ball draw for that game. A card-minding device shall do all of the following: 
a.  Be capable of storing in the memory of the device bingo faces of tangible cards purchased by a player.

d.  Determine the outcome of any game or be physically or electronically connected to any component that determines the outcome of a game or to any other bingo equipment, including, but not limited to, the ball call station, or to any other card-minding device. No other player-operated or player-activated electronic or electromechanical device or equipment is permitted to be used in connection with a bingo game. 
(3)  A card-minding device shall be approved in advance by the California Gambling Control Commission as meeting the requirements of this State law and any additional requirements stated in regulations adopted by the commission. 
(e)  A violation of subsection (c)(10) of this section shall constitute a violation of Penal Code § 326.5 and shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000.00, which fine shall be deposited in the General Fund of the City.

Sec. 28-47. - Paint spray cans; sale to minors. 
(a)  No person shall sell or direct the sale of any paint spray can to any person under the age of 18 years. 
(b)  The City Council hereby determines that this section is necessary for the preservation of the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City, in that such section is necessary to restrict the use of paint spray cans in the City by persons under the age of 18 years. Paint spray cans have been used and are being used with increasing frequency by persons under the age of 18 years for the purpose of defacing block walls along public right-of-ways throughout the City. Such defacement constitutes blight and a public nuisance and the restoration of such defacement imposes an unnecessary and undue financial burden on the taxpayers of the City.

(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose and intent of the City council through the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of vandalism and defacement, especially, but not limited to graffiti on privately and publicly owned walls which are inimical and destructive of the rights and values of private property owners as well as the total community. The power of graffiti to create fear within the community and blight upon the landscape, devaluing property and detracting from the sense of community enjoyed by the residents of La Palma, is beyond the cost of cleanup or removal. Not only is graffiti a property crime, but it is also a social crime on the quality of life and freedom from intimidation citizens deserve within their neighborhoods.

(2)  Where a structure is owned by a public entity other than the City, the removal of such graffiti or other inscribed material is authorized only upon securing the written consent of the public entity having jurisdiction with respect to such structure and such entity executes a release and waiver approved as to form and substance by the City Attorney, and the City obtains property owner consent to access any necessary non-City lands to conduct the graffiti removal; and

(a)  R-1, Single-Family Residential. The R-1 zoning district identifies areas intended for single-family housing types, including conventional single-family detached homes, patio homes, zero lot line homes, planned unit developments, mixed-use developments, and attached, lower-density developments such as duplexes. The allowable density range is from 1.0 to 8.7 dwelling units per net acre. This designation requires conventional single-family lots to be a minimum of 5,000 square feet. Allowable housing types, other than conventional single-family detached, are permitted on lots less than 5,000 square feet, subject to approval by the City Council. The R-1 zoning district is consistent with the single-family residential land use designation of the general plan. 
(b)  R-3, Multiple-Family Residential. The R-3 zoning district identifies areas intended for the development of a range of attached and detached residential uses. Typical housing types include higher density single-family residences, patio homes, zero lot line homes, planned unit developments, mixed-use developments, and attached multiple-family dwellings such as duplexes, townhomes, condominiums, and garden apartments. Congregate care facilities and similar uses may be approved as conditional uses in compliance with the provisions in Article V, Division 5 (Conditional Use Permits and Amendments). Smaller sites composed of two acres or less are permitted to be developed with a maximum density of ten dwelling units per net acre. Larger sites that are between two and one-tenth to four acres are permitted to be developed with densities up to 15 dwelling units per net acre and sites composed of at least four and one-tenth acres are permitted to be developed with a maximum density of 25 dwelling units per net acre. The R-3 zoning district is consistent with the multiple-family residential land use designation of the general plan. 
(c)  VRO, Village Residential Overlay. The VRO designation is intended as an overlay zone for certain areas within the multiple-family residential land use designation that involve special development opportunities and require a tailored approach to planning and design. The designation is intended to provide for a variety of housing types within one project or development, ranging from single-family housing to multiple-family dwellings, including uses incidental to the residential uses. The types of developments that are suitable to the Village Residential Overlay include affordable housing projects, senior housing projects, or planned unit developments that involve tailored development standards and site design. The maximum allowable density on a parcel within the Multiple-Family Residential (R-3) to which the VRO designation is applied shall be 30 units to the acre (30 du/ac), regardless of the size of the parcel in the Multiple-Family Residential (R-3) to which the VRO designation is applied.

Religious institutions located within the GI District may establish onsite emergency shelters for up to ten beds or persons per night without the need to amend an existing precise plan and/or conditional use permit or apply for a new conditional use permit, regardless of current combined capacity with any existing emergency shelters currently in operation, subject to the minimum development standards contain within this section. 
(3)  The emergency shelter shall operate on a first-come, first-served basis with clients only permitted on site and admitted to the shelter between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. during Pacific Daylight Time, and 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. during Pacific Standard Time. Clients must vacate the emergency shelter by 8:00 a.m. and have no guaranteed bed for the next night. 
(4)  The maximum stay of a given person at the emergency shelter shall not exceed a total of 180 days (cumulative, even if not consecutive) within a 365-day period.

(7)  Size and location of on-site waiting areas and client intake areas. An on-site waiting area shall be provided and clearly identified for all clients. The on-site waiting area shall be no larger than ten square feet for every one bed provided at the emergency shelter. Said waiting area shall be in a location that is not adjacent to the public right-of-way. The client intake area shall be located directly adjacent to the on-site waiting area. 
(8)  All emergency shelter improvements shall comply with this chapter, and the most current adopted building and safety code, specific to the establishment of dormitories. 
(9)  A security and safety plan shall be provided to the City for review and approval in conjunction with any application for a business license for an emergency shelter. The plan may be required to address additional security and safety needs as identified by the City Manager or his or her designee. The approved security and safety plan shall remain active throughout the life of the emergency shelter. The plan shall contain, at minimum, provisions addressing the following topical areas: 
a.  Sleeping areas. The separation of male/female sleeping areas, as well as any family areas within the shelter. 
b.  Loitering control. Specific off-site controls to minimize the congregation of clients in the vicinity of the shelter and in adjacent neighborhoods during hours that clients are not allowed on site. 
c.  Management of outdoor areas. A system for daily admittance and discharge procedures and monitoring of waiting areas, with the goal of minimizing disruption to nearby land uses. 
d.  Alcohol and illegal drugs. How the operator will control and regulate alcohol and illegal drug use by clients on the premises.

Such staff members must be individuals who do not utilize the shelter's beds or other services and who reside off site. 
(11)  The emergency shelter shall provide off-street parking at the ratio of one space per five beds and/or one-half spaces per bedroom designed as a family unit with children, plus one space per employee or volunteer staff member on duty. Alternatively, the emergency shelter may submit a parking study, subject to approval by the City, demonstrating that the parking demand associated with the emergency shelter justifies requiring a reduced amount of off-street parking. Each shelter shall also provide a bike rack in a secured area on the premises. 
(12)  Public health and safety requirements. 
a.  Health permit. An emergency shelter operating without any food services shall be required to comply with applicable Orange County Health Care Agency standards and regulations and secure any necessary permits prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy and a business license. Any emergency shelter that contains a kitchen, but that does not provide food services, shall comply with all applicable Orange County Health Department standards and regulations; however, such kitchen shall not be remodeled into a commercial kitchen. 
b.  Fire and safety. Sleeping sections or rooms shall be equipped with a smoke detector, a hand-held fire extinguisher, and an evacuation plan, subject to review by the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA).

Sec. 44-194. - Purpose. 
(a)  The intent of this subdivision is to regulate adult oriented businesses which, because of their very nature, are believed to have many of the recognized significant secondary effects on the community which include: depreciated property values and increased vacancies in residential areas in the vicinity of the adult oriented businesses; higher crime rates, noise, debris, or vandalism in the vicinity of adult oriented businesses; and blighting conditions such as low level maintenance of commercial premises and parking lots which thereby have a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the neighborhoods in the vicinity of the adult oriented businesses. It is neither the intent nor effect of this subdivision to impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative material.

Sec. 44-976. - Purpose. 
(a)  The intent of this division is to regulate adult oriented businesses which, because of their very nature, are believed to have many recognized significant secondary effects on the community which include, but are not limited to: depreciated property values and increased vacancies in residential areas in the vicinity of the adult oriented businesses; higher crime rates, noise, debris, or vandalism in the vicinity of adult oriented businesses; and blighting conditions such as low level maintenance of commercial premises and parking lots which thereby have a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the neighborhoods in the vicinity of the adult oriented businesses. It is neither the intent nor effect of this section to impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative material. Similarly, it is neither the intent, nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials or merchandise protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of adult oriented business to their intended market. 
(b)  Nothing in this section is intended to authorize, legalize, or permit the establishment, operation, or maintenance of any business, building, or use which violates any City ordinance or any statute of the State of California regarding public nuisances, unlawful exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness, or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof. 
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 3, 5-5-2015)  
Sec. 44-977. - Application requirements.

(b)  The following information is required at the time an adult oriented business permit application is submitted to the Community Development Director: 
(1)  A completed adult oriented business permit application signed by the property owner or authorized representative. 
(2)  A nonrefundable deposit and/or fee as set forth by resolution of the City Council.

The applicant shall have 30 calendar days to submit additional information to render the application complete. Failure to do so within the 30-day period shall render the application null and void. Within five business days following the receipt of an amended application or supplemental information, the City Manager shall again determine whether the application is complete in accordance with the procedures set forth above. Evaluation and notification shall occur as provided above until such time as the application is found to be complete. Once the application is found to be complete, the applicant shall be notified within five business days of that fact. All notices required by this chapter shall be deemed given upon the date they are either deposited in the United States mail, or the date upon which personal service of such notice is provided. 
(b)  Issuance of permit.

The applicant shall be notified within five business days of the date the City Manager issues the adult oriented business permit in the manner provided above. The decision of the City Manager to issue or deny a permit shall be final. If the City Manager does not issue or deny the permit within 15 calendar days of the date the application is complete pursuant to this chapter, the application shall be deemed issued by operation of law. 
(c)  Prompt judicial review. Any applicant whose permit has been denied pursuant to this chapter shall be afforded prompt judicial review of that decision as provided by law. 
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 3, 5-5-2015)

No adult oriented business permit may be sold, transferred, or assigned by any permittee or by operation of law, to any other person, group, partnership, corporation, or any other entity. Any such sale, transfer, or assignment or attempted sale, transfer, or assignment shall be deemed to constitute a voluntary surrender of the permit and the permit shall be thereafter null and void. An adult oriented business permit held by a corporation or partnership is subject to the same rules of transferability as contained above. Any change in the nature or composition of the adult oriented business from one element of an adult oriented business to another element of an adult oriented business shall also render the permit null and void. An adult oriented business permit shall only be valid for the exact location specified on the permit.

Sec. 44-1038. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose and intent of this division is to provide a process for reviewing variance and minor exceptions applications, which are intended to allow for adjustment in the development standards of this chapter only when the strict application of this Code denies the property owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and within identical zoning districts. Special circumstances that justify the granting of a variance or minor exception include the location, shape, size, surroundings, or topography of a site. 
(b)  Any variance or minor exception granted shall be subject to conditions that would ensure that the variance does not constitute a granting of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which the property is situated, in compliance with State law (Government Code § 65906). The reviewing authority may grant a variance or minor exception from any property development standard (including setbacks, heights, parking requirements, and other numerical standards) in this zoning code, subject to the procedures set forth in this section. Except for the minor exceptions listed below, all requests to deviate from code requirements shall require the approval of a variance. In calculating percentages specified in this section, rounding up of fractions shall not be permitted. The following deviations from code requirements may be processed as minor exceptions: 
(1)  Minor exceptions for up to ten percent of standard. Any deviation of numerical standard contained in this zoning code of ten percent or less of the maximum or minimum standard may be granted. 
(2)  Minor exceptions are not applicable to new construction projects as define in Section 44-10.

The review authority identified in Table IV-1 in Section 44-485 may grant approval of variances from the requirements of this chapter governing only the following development standards: 
(1)  Dimensional standards. Dimensional standards including distance-separation requirements, lot area, fence and wall requirements, landscape and paving requirements, lot dimensions, on site parking areas, and open space. 
(2)  Driveway length. A reduction in the required driveway length. 
(3)  Onsite parking. A reduction in the number of required onsite parking spaces and/or loading spaces. 
(4)  Parcel coverage. An increase in the maximum percent of parcel coverage allowed. 
(5)  Setback/yard area. A reduction in the required setback/yard areas for structures, landscaping, swimming pools/spas, and equipment. 
(6)  Signs. A change related to the number, size, placement, or illumination. 
(7)  Structure height. An increase in the maximum allowed height of a structure.

The review authority may approve an application, with or without conditions, only if all the following findings of fact can be made: 
(1)  There are special circumstances applicable to the property (e.g., location, shape, size, surroundings, or topography), so that the strict application of this chapter denies the property owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and under identical zoning districts. 
(2)  Granting the variance would not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties classified in the same zoning district. 
(3)  Granting the variance would not authorize a use of activity that is not otherwise expressly authorized by the zoning district regulations governing the subject property. 
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 3, 5-5-2015)  
Sec. 44-1042. - Conditions. 
In approving a variance, the review authority may impose specific development conditions relating to both on-site and off-site improvements (e.g., dedications, easements, and public improvements), as it finds are reasonable and necessary to ensure that the approval would be in compliance with the findings required by Section 44-1041.

A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any individual with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when the application of a City land use, zoning or building regulation, or policy, practice or procedure acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities for persons with disabilities.

A reasonable accommodation does not affect an individual's obligation to comply with other applicable regulations not at issue in the requested accommodation. 
(4)  If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the City shall provide assistance, to the extent reasonably feasible, to ensure that the process is accessible.

(1)  Whether the housing, which is the subject of the request for reasonable accommodation, will be used by an individual with disabilities protected under the fair housing laws; 
(2)  Whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual with disabilities protected under the fair housing laws; 
(3)  Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City; and 
(4)  Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the City's land use and zoning and/or building program. 
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 3, 5-5-2015)
