accordance with the Town Charter. A second Annual Meeting shall convene during September, October or

prior to the meeting. The warrants will be available to the voters at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meetings

Notice of every Annual Town Meeting and Special Town Meeting shall be given by posting an attested copy of the
warrant calling said meeting shall be posted no later than fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of said
meeting. If the motions are not contained in the warrant, they shall be posted in the same manner as the warrant no
later than fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of said meeting. Notice of said meeting shall be published
no later than fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of said meeting in a newspaper of general and local

As soon as practical after the adjournment of the Annual Town Meeting, if time permits on a vote to adjourn to
another day, the Town Clerk shall cause a brief statement of the day and hour to which the adjournment was voted
and of the business remaining to come before the meeting, to be posted, and if the period of the adjournment will
permit, shall cause a similar notice to be published in one or more newspapers having general distribution in the
Town.
Any Article which is to appear in a Warrant must be presented to the Finance Committee by the Board of
Selectmen not later than forty-five (45) days before the date of the meeting. If this does not occur and the Finance
Committee does not have sufficient time to make a recommendation, they may not recommend its passage.
All recommendations of the Finance Committee to a Town Meeting shall be the recommendations of the majority
of the entire Committee, but this shall not be construed to prevent recommendations by a minority.

approval of the majority of those present and voting.

after the disposal of all other articles.
All motions requiring expenditure of money shall be presented in writing. Other motions shall be in writing unless
permitted by the Moderator to be presented orally.
When a question is put, the sense of the meeting shall be determined by a show of hands (unless otherwise voted by
the meeting), and the Moderator shall declare the vote as it appears to him. If a vote so declared is immediately
questioned by seven or more voters, he shall verify it by polling the voters or by dividing the meeting.
If a motion is susceptible of division, it shall be divided and the question shall be put separately upon each part
thereof, if a majority of those present and voting so vote.
If a motion is made and seconded to conduct a secret ballot on any warrant article or proposed amendment to an
article and the motion to conduct a secret ballot is supported by 25% (twenty-five percent) of those voting, then the
vote on the warrant article or amendment shall be taken by secret ballot.

in writing unless an oral report is authorized by the Moderator.

payment of a portion of the annual trash fee and purchase of designated bags) by contracting with a licensed
solid waste hauling company for the removal and disposal of trash. Any property owner seeking this
exemption must annually provide the Board of Health with an acceptable signed contract from a properly
licensed and permitted hauler.

according to the appropriate administrative policy on file in the Board of Selectman’s office.

CATEGORY 20C – Stormwater Management; Post Construction New Developments &
Redevelopments
Section 1 – Purpose
The purpose of this bylaw is to regulate discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to
protect the Town's water bodies and groundwater, and to safeguard public health, safety, welfare and the
environment. Increased and contaminated stormwater runoff associated with developed land uses and the
accompanying increase in impervious surface are the major causes of:
1. Impairment of water quality and flow in lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, wetlands and groundwater;
2. Contamination of drinking water supplies;
3. Erosion of stream channels;
4. Alteration or destruction of aquatic and wildlife habitat; and,
5. Flooding.
Therefore, this by-law establishes stormwater management standards for the final conditions that result from
development and redevelopment projects to minimize adverse impacts offsite and downstream, which would be
borne by abutters, townspeople and the general public.
The objectives of this by-law are to:
1. Require practices to control the flow of stormwater from new and redeveloped sites into the Town of Seekonk’s
municipal storm drainage system in order to prevent flooding and erosion;
2. Protect groundwater and surface water from degradation;
3. Promote groundwater recharge;
4. Prevent pollutants from entering the Town of Seekonk’s MS4 and to minimize discharge of pollutants from the MS4;
5. Ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance of structural stormwater best management practices (BMPs)
so that they work as designed;
6. Comply with state and federal statutes and regulations relating to stormwater discharges; and,
7. Establish the Town of Seekonk’s legal authority to ensure compliance with the provisions of this bylaw through
inspection, monitoring, and enforcement.
Section 2 – Definitions

17. Any other information requested by the Planning Board.
B. Standards
Projects shall meet the Standards of the Massachusetts Stormwater Management Policy, which are
summarized as follows:
1. No new stormwater conveyances (e.g. outfalls) may discharge untreated stormwater directly to or cause
erosion in wetlands or waters of the Commonwealth.
2. Stormwater management systems must be designed so that post-development peak discharge rates do not
exceed pre-development peak discharge rates.
3. Loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized through the use of infiltration measures to the
maximum extent practicable. The annual recharge from the post-development site should approximate the
annual recharge rate from the pre-development or existing site conditions, based on soil types.
4. For new development, stormwater management systems must be designed to remove 80% of the average
annual load (post development conditions) of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). It is presumed that this standard
is met when:
a. Suitable nonstructural practices for source control and pollution prevention are implemented;
b. Stormwater management best management practices (BMPs) are sized to capture the prescribed
runoff volume; and
c. Stormwater management BMPs are maintained as designed by the responsible party(ies).
5. Stormwater discharges from areas with higher potential pollutant loads require the use of specific stormwater
management BMPs (see Stormwater Management Volume I: Stormwater Policy Handbook). The use of
infiltration practices without pretreatment is prohibited.
6. Stormwater discharges to critical areas must utilize certain stormwater management BMPs approved for
critical areas (see DEP’s Stormwater Management Volume I: Stormwater Policy Handbook). Critical areas are
TOWN BY-LAWS – MAY 14, 2018 54
Outstanding Resource Waters (ORWs), shellfish beds, swimming beaches, cold water fisheries and recharge
areas for public water supplies.
7. Redevelopment of previously developed sites must meet the Stormwater Management Standards to the
maximum extent practicable. However, if it is not practicable to meet all the Standards, new (retrofitted or
expanded) stormwater management systems must be designed to improve existing conditions.
8. Erosion and sedimentation controls must be implemented to prevent impacts during disturbance and
construction activities.
9. All stormwater management systems must have an operation and maintenance plan to ensure that systems
function continuously and consistently as designed.
10. All illicit discharges to the stormwater management system are prohibited.
When one or more of the Standards cannot be met, an applicant may demonstrate that an equivalent level of
environmental protection will be provided.
C. Where Applicable, projects shall conform to the requirements of the Planning Board regulations, including but not
limited to the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land (dated April 27, 2004 or later).
D. Project Completion
Upon completion of the project, the permit shall submit as-built record drawings of all structural stormwater controls
and treatment BMPs required for the site. The as-built drawing shall show deviations from the approved plans, if any,
and be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer.
Section 8 – Operations and Maintenance Plans
An Operation and Maintenance plan (O&M Plan) is required at the time of application for all projects. The
maintenance plan shall be designed to ensure compliance with the Permit, this Bylaw and that the Massachusetts
Surface Water Quality Standards, 314, CMR 4.00 are met in all seasons and throughout the life of the system. The
Planning Board shall make the final decision of what maintenance option is appropriate in a given situation. The
Planning Board will consider natural features, proximity of site to water bodies and wetlands, extent of impervious
surfaces, size of the site, the types of stormwater management structures, and potential need for ongoing
maintenance activities when making this decision. The Operation and Maintenance Plan shall remain on file with
the Planning Board and shall be an ongoing requirement. The O&M Plan shall include:
A. The name(s) of the owner(s) for all components of the system
B. Maintenance agreements that specify:
1. The names and addresses of the person(s) responsible for operation and maintenance
2. The person(s) responsible for financing maintenance and emergency repairs.
3. A Maintenance Schedule for all drainage structures, including swales and ponds.
4. A list of easements with the purpose, location, and limitations (if any) of each.
5. The signature(s) of the owner(s).
C. Stormwater Management Easement(s).
1. Stormwater management easements shall be provided by the property owner(s) as necessary for:
i. access for facility inspections and maintenance,
ii. preservation of stormwater runoff conveyance, infiltration, and detention areas and facilities,
including flood routes for the 100-year storm event.
iii. direct maintenance access by heavy equipment to structures requiring regular cleanout.
2. The purpose of each easement shall be specified in the maintenance agreement signed by the property owner.
3. Stormwater management easements are required for all areas used for off-site stormwater control, unless a
waiver is granted by the Planning Board.
4. Easements shall be recorded with the Northern Bristol County Registry of Deeds prior to issuance of a
Certificate of Completion by the Planning Board.
D. Changes to Operation and Maintenance Plans
1. The owner(s) of the stormwater management system must notify the Planning Board within thirty (30) days
of changes in ownership or assignment of financial responsibility.
TOWN BY-LAWS – MAY 14, 2018 55
2. The maintenance schedule in the Maintenance Agreement may be amended to achieve the purposes of this
by-law by mutual agreement of the Planning Board and the Responsible Parties. Amendments must be in
writing and signed by all Responsible Parties. Responsible Parties shall include owner(s), persons with
financial responsibility, and persons with operational responsibility.
E. Future Ownership and Operation & Maintenance of BMPs
In non-residential developments, responsibility for the ownership and Operation & Maintenance of
stormwater BMP’s shall be that of the owners of property on which the stormwater BMP’s are located. For
stormwater BMP’s that are constructed within a residential subdivision, a homeowner’s association shall be
established to assume responsibility for the ownership and Operation & Maintenance of stormwater BMP’s.
Legal documents establishing said association shall be recorded at the time of the recording of the
subdivision. Reports shall be submitted to the Public Works Department one year following the date of the
completion of construction of said BMP’s and every year thereafter. In the event of failure of the owners of
property on which the stormwater BMP’s are located, the Town may enter upon the subject property to
perform such necessary maintenance as may be necessary to achieve compliance with the approved
Operation and Maintenance Plan. An easement shall be recorded upon approval of all BMP’s allowing the
Town to perform said maintenance and charge the owners of the subject property the cost therefore,
inclusive of reasonable attorney’s fees in the collection of the said cost.
Section 9 – Surety
The Planning Board may require the applicant to post before the start of land disturbance or construction activity, a
surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, cash, or other acceptable security. The form of the bond shall be approved
by the Planning Board and be in an amount deemed sufficient by the Planning Board to ensure that the work will be
completed in accordance with the permit. If the project is phased, the Planning Board may release part of the bond
as each phase is completed in compliance with the permit.
A minimum of one year following the receipt of the final inspection report as required by Section 10 and issuance
of a Certificate of Completion, the applicant may request that the Planning Board release the last $5,000 or 10% of
the security amount, whichever is more, subject to the inspection and approval of the Board upon receiving
favorable recommendations from the Town Planner, DPW Superintendent, Building Inspector, or any other
Board’s Agent designated by the Planning Board.
Section 10 – Inspections
The Planning Board, or its agents, shall inspect the project site at the following stages:
A. Initial Site Inspection - prior to approval of any plan.
B. Erosion Control Inspection - to ensure erosion control practices are in accord with the filed plan.
C. Bury Inspection - prior to backfilling of any underground drainage or stormwater conveyance structures.
D. Final Inspection - after the stormwater management system has been constructed and before the surety has
been released, the applicant must submit a record plan detailing the actual stormwater management system
as installed. The Planning Board, or its agents, shall inspect the system to confirm its "as-built" features.
This inspector shall also evaluate the effectiveness of the system in an actual storm as defined by the town’s
standards. If the inspector finds the system to be adequate, the inspector shall recommend that the Planning
Board issue a Certificate of Completion.
If the system is found to be inadequate by virtue of physical evidence of operational failure, even though it was built
as called for in the Stormwater Management Plan, it shall be corrected by the permittee before the performance
guarantee is released. If the permittee fails to act, the Town of Seekonk may use the surety bond to complete the
work. Examples of inadequacy shall include but not be limited to: errors in the infiltrative capability, errors in the
maximum groundwater elevation, failure to properly define or construct flow paths, or erosive discharges from
basins.

cumulative effect upon resource area values, including but not limited to the following: public or private water supply,
groundwater, flood control, erosion and sedimentation control, storm damage prevention, water quality, water pollution
prevention, fisheries, shellfish, wildlife habitat, rare species habitat including rare plant species, aesthetics, and agriculture,
aquaculture, and recreation values deemed important to the community (collectively, the “resource area values protected by
this by-law”). This by-law is intended to utilize the Home Rule authority of this municipality to protect additional resource
areas, for additional values, with additional standards and procedures stricter than those of the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L.
Ch. 131 §40) and Regulations thereunder (310 CMR 10.00). In addition to the more stringent protection noted above, this bylaw

Section 3 – Exceptions
The permit and application required by this by-law shall not be required for maintaining, repairing, or replacing, but not
substantially changing or enlarging, an existing and lawfully located structure or facility used in the service of the public to
provide electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, radio and television transmissions, or other telecommunication services,
provided that written notice has been given to the Commission prior to commencement of work, and provided that the work
conforms to performance standards and design specifications in regulations adopted by the Commission.
The permit and application required by this by-law shall not be required for work performed for normal maintenance or
improvement of land which is lawfully in agricultural use at the time, provided that written notice has been given to the
Commission prior to commencement of work, and provided that the work conforms to performance standards and design
specifications in regulations adopted by the Commission.
Land defined as “in agricultural use” must already be actively devoted to agricultural use, as opposed to the entire property,
and must either have been in such use since before 1975 or have received a permit for conversion to agriculture from the
Conservation Commission to be subject to this exemption. Proposals to convert land to agricultural use must be reviewed by
the Conservation Commission.
Land that has been brought within agricultural use after 1975 without having first been issued a permit by the Conservation
Commission is not considered to be land that is lawfully already being used for agricultural purposes.
Agricultural land can be fallow for some time if it has been used for agriculture for at least three (3) of the preceding five (5)
years.
TOWN BY-LAWS – MAY 14, 2018 82
Agricultural uses of land include: raising livestock; growing cranberries; growing other foods for human or animal
consumption; raising sod, trees, nursery stock, and ornamental plants; forestry activities, where the land is managed for a
continuous crop, and tree farming.
Only activities that constitute “normal maintenance or improvement” of existing agricultural land are exempt from regulation.
Such activities include: plowing and tilling, pasturing of animals, using fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals in accordance
with state and federal law, projects including ditches, drains, access roads, farm ponds, erosion control devices designed to
improve drainage, increase access, and enhance productivity and efficiency of the agricultural operations, cultivating
cranberries, provided that all activities are conducted in a way as to prevent erosion and siltation, cutting and removing trees
for market of the trees or forest products, and selective cutting of trees for individual use by the owners. Tree cutting on land
that is not agricultural land is not included.
Normal maintenance or improvement must be related to ongoing uses, i.e., agricultural activity during the past five years.
The permit and application required by this by-law shall not apply to emergency projects necessary for the protection of the
health or safety of the public, provided that the work is to be performed by or has been ordered to be performed by an agency
of the Commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, provided that advance notice, oral or written, has been given to the
Commission prior to commencement of work or within 24 hours after commencement, provided that the Conservation
Commission or its agent certifies the work as an emergency project, provided that the work is performed only for the time and
place certified by the Conservation Commission for the limited purposes necessary to abate the emergency, and provided that
within 21 days of commencement of an emergency project a permit application shall be filed with the Commission for review
as provided by this by-law. Upon failure to meet these and other requirements of the Commission, the Commission may, after
notice and a public hearing, revoke or modify an emergency project approval and order restoration and mitigation measures.

plans filed under the Wetland Protection Act, M.G.L. c. 131, §40 and Regulations (310CMR 10.00).
Any person desiring to know whether or not proposed activity or an area is subject to this by-law may in writing request a
determination from the Commission. Such a Request for Determination (RFD) shall include data and plans as are deemed
necessary by the Commission.
At the time of an application or request, the applicant shall pay a filling fee as required by the Wetlands Protection Act, M.G.L.
c. 131, §40. The Commission may waive the filling fee and costs and expenses for an application or request filed by a
government agency and may waive them for a request for determination filed by a person having no financial connection with
the property which is the subject of the request.
Section 5 – Notice and Hearings
Any person filing an application with the Commission at the same time shall give written notice thereof, by certified mail
(return receipt requested) or hand delivery, to all abutters at their mailing addresses shown on the most recent applicable tax
list of the assessors, including owners of land directly opposite on any public or private street or way, and abutters to the
abutters within 300 feet of the property line of the applicant, including any in another municipality or across a body of water.
The notice to abutters shall enclose a copy of the application, with plans, or shall state where copies may be examined and
obtained by abutters. An affidavit of the person providing such notice, with a copy of the notice mailed or delivered, shall be

the expense of the applicant five working days prior to the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality.
TOWN BY-LAWS – MAY 14, 2018 83
The Commission shall commence the public hearing within 21 days from receipt of a completed application or Request for
Determination unless an extension is authorized in writing by the applicant.
The Commission shall issue its permit or determination in writing with 21 days of the close of the public hearing thereon
unless an extension is authorized in writing by the applicant.
The Commission in an appropriate case may combine its hearing under the by-law with the hearing conducted under the
Wetlands Protection Act, M.G.L. c. 131, §40 and Regulations (310CMR 10.00).
The Commission shall have authority to continue the hearing to a date certain announced at the hearing, for reasons stated at
the hearing, which may include receipt of additional information offered by the applicant or others, information and plans
required of the applicant, deemed necessary by the Commission in its discretion, or comments, and recommendations of
boards and officials list in Section 6. In the event the applicant object to a continuance or postponement, the hearing shall be
closed and the Commission shall take action on such information as is available.
Section 6 – Coordination with Other Boards
Any person filing a permit application or a Request for Determination with the Commission can be required to provide a copy
thereof at the same time, by certified mail (return receipt requested) or hand delivery, to the Board of Selectmen, Planning
Board, Board of Appeals, Board of Health, and Building Inspector. A copy shall be provided in the same manner to the
Conservation Commission of the adjoining municipality, if the application or RFD pertains to property within 300 feet of that
municipality. An affidavit of the person providing such notice, with a copy of the notice mailed or delivered, shall be filed
with the Commission. The Commission shall not take final action until such boards and officials have had fourteen (14) days
from receipt of notice to file written comments and recommendations with the Commission, which the Commission shall take
into account but which shall not be binding on the Commission. The applicant shall have the right to receive any such
comments and recommendations and to respond to them at a hearing of the Commission, prior to final action.
Section 7 – Permits, Determinations, and Conditions
If the Commission after a public hearing determines that the activities which are the subject of the application or the land and
water uses which will result therefrom are likely to have a significant or cumulative effect upon the resource area values
protected by this by-law, the Commission, within 21 days of the close of the hearing, shall issue or deny a permit for the
activities requested. If it issues a permit, the Commission shall impose conditions which the Commission deems necessary or
desirable to protect those values, and all activities shall be done in accordance with those conditions. The Commission shall
take into account the cumulative adverse effects of loss, degradation, isolation, and replication of protected resource areas
throughout the community and the watershed, resulting from past activities, permitted and exempt, and foreseeable future
activities.
The Commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements of this by-law, for failure to submit
necessary information and plans requested by the Commission; for failure to meet the design specifications, performance
standards, and other requirements in regulations of the Commission; for failure to avoid or prevent unacceptable significant or
cumulative effects upon the resource area values protected by this by-law; and where no conditions are adequate to protect
those values. Due consideration shall be given to any demonstrated hardship on the applicant by reason of denial, as
presented at the public hearing.
Lands within 200 feet of rivers, ponds, and lakes, and lands within 100 feet of other resource areas listed in Section 2 are
within the jurisdiction of the Seekonk Conservation Commission. These lands are presumed important to the protection of
these resources because activities undertaken in close proximity to resource areas have a high likelihood of adverse impact
upon the wetland or other resource, either immediately, as a consequence of construction, or over time, as a consequence of
daily operation or existence of the activities. These adverse impacts from construction and use can include, without limitation,
erosion, siltation, loss of groundwater recharge, poor water quality, and loss of wildlife habitat. The Commission therefore
may require that the applicant maintain a strip of continuous, undisturbed vegetative cover within the 200-foot [or 100-foot]
area, unless the applicant convinces the Commission that the area or part of it may be disturbed without harm to the values
protected by the by-law.
In the review of areas within 200 feet of rivers and streams, no permit issued hereunder shall permit any activities unless the
applicant, in addition to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this by-law, has proved by a preponderance of the
evidence that (1) there is no practicable alternative to the proposed property use, overall project purpose (e.g. residential,
TOWN BY-LAWS – MAY 14, 2018 84
institutional, commercial, or industrial purpose), logistics, existing technology, costs of the alternatives, and overall project
costs.
To prevent wetlands loss, the Commission shall require applicants to avoid wetlands alteration wherever feasible; shall
minimize wetlands alteration; and, where alteration is unavoidable, shall require full mitigation. The Commission may

Section 1. AUTHORITY, PURPOSE, DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.1 Authority
The Town of Seekonk Zoning By-law is adopted under Chapter 40A of the General Laws (the Zoning
Act) and Article 89 of the Amendments to the Constitution (the Home Rule Amendment).
1.2 Purpose
The zoning districts and regulations pertaining thereto as herein set forth are made in accordance with a
comprehensive plan to regulate the use of land, buildings, and structures for the purpose of promoting and
protecting the health, safety and general welfare of the community and the present and future inhabitants
of the Town of Seekonk.
They are designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to conserve health; to secure safety from fire, flood,
panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent over-crowding of land; to avoid
undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water supply,
drainage, sewerage, schools, parks, open space, and other public requirements; to conserve the value of
land and buildings, including the conservation of natural resources and the prevention of blight and
pollution of the environment; to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the Town,
including consideration of the Master Plan adopted by the Planning Board and the Comprehensive Plan, if
any, of the Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic Development District; and to preserve and
increase amenities, to promote responsible economic development; and to support quality housing for
persons of all income levels. They are made with reasonable consideration given to the character of each
district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses.
Since the purpose of these By-laws is to promote the quality of life and environment in Seekonk by
regulating property uses, whenever there appear to be multiple interpretations of points within these Bylaws,
the more restricting or more controlling interpretation is intended and will prevail unless ruled
otherwise by due course of law.

2.2 Special Permits
2.2.1 Definition
The Zoning By-laws of the Town of Seekonk provide for specific types of uses which shall only be
permitted in the specific districts upon the issuance of a special permit.
2.2.2 Powers
The Special Permit Granting Authority (“SPGA”), as defined in Section 0 shall have the power, after
public hearing notice has been given by publication and posting as provided in Section 2.4.1 and by
mailing to all parties in interest, to issue, upon application, special permits for uses permitted thereby in
certain districts.
Special permits are to be issued only for uses which are in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
these Zoning By-laws, and shall be subject to general or specific provisions set forth herein. Special
permits may also impose conditions, safeguards, and limitation on time or use.
2.2.3 Procedures
Special permits shall only be issued following public hearings held, as required under G.L. c.40A, within
sixty-five (65) days after filing of an application with the Town Clerk, a copy of which shall forthwith be
given to the SPGA, normally the Zoning Board of Appeals, by the Town Clerk. The SPGA shall adopt
and from time to time amend rules relative to the issuance of such permits and shall file a copy of said
rules in the office of the Town Clerk. Such rules must prescribe the size, form, contents, style, and
number of copies of plans and specifications and the procedure for the submission and approval of such
permits. Failure to conform to submission requirements shall constitute a reason to deny the relief sought.
The SPGA shall act within ninety (90) days following the close of the public hearing for which notice has
been given by publication or posting as provided in Section 2.4.1 and by mailing to all parties in interest.
Failure by the SPGA to take final action upon an application for a special permit within said ninety (90)
days following the date of the close of the public hearing shall be deemed to be a grant of the permit
applied for. Special permits issued by the SPGA shall require four (4) concurring votes.
14
2.2.4 Period of Validity
A special permit granted under this section shall lapse after two years, plus such time as is required to
pursue or await the determination of an appeal referred to in Section 2.7 from the grant thereof, if a
substantial use thereof has not soon commenced except for good cause or, in the case of permit for
construction, if construction has not begun by such date except for good cause. The special permit shall
be recorded before it lapses and before it is exercised in order for it to take effect.
2.2.5 Special Permits for Scientific Research Development / Production Uses
Uses, whether or not on the same parcel as activities permitted as a matter of right, accessory to activities
permitted as a matter of right, which activities are necessary in connection with scientific research or
scientific development or related production, may be permitted upon the issuance of a special permit
provided the SPGA finds that the proposed accessory use does not substantially derogate from the public
good.
2.3 Variances
2.3.1.1 Definitions, Powers
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power, after public hearing, notice for which has been given
by publication and posting as provided in Section 2.4.1 and by mailing to all parties in interest, to grant,
upon petition with respect to particular land or structures, a variance from the terms of the By-law where
the Zoning Board of Appeals specifically finds that owing to circumstances relating to the soil conditions,
shape, size or topography of such land or structures but not affecting generally the zoning district in which
it is located, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the By-law would involve substantial hardship,
financial or otherwise, to the petitioner or appellant, and that desirable relief may be granted without
substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent
or purpose of these By-laws. No variance may authorize a use or activity not otherwise permitted in the
district in which the land or structure is located, provided, however, that such use variances that were
properly granted prior to January first, nineteen hundred and seventy-six but that were limited in time,
may be extended on the same terms and conditions that were in effect for any such variance upon said
effective date.
2.3.2 Conditions of Variance
The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose conditions, safeguards, and limitations both of time and use,
including the continued existence of any particular structures but excluding any condition, safeguards, and
limitation based upon the continued ownership of the land or structures to which the variance pertains by
the applicant, petitioner, or any owner.
If the rights authorized by a variance are not exercised within one year of the date of grant of such
variance such rights shall lapse; provided, however, that the Zoning Board of Appeals in its discretion and
upon written application by the grantee of such rights may extend the time for exercise of such rights for a
period not to exceed six months; and provided, further, that the application for such extension is filed with
the Zoning Board of Appeals prior to the expiration of such one year period. If the Zoning Board of
Appeals does not grant such extension within thirty (30) days of the date of application, and upon the
expiration of the original one year period, such rights may be reestablished only after notice and a new
hearing pursuant to the provisions of this section.
2.4 Public Hearing
2.4.1 General Requirements
15
In all cases where notice of a public hearing is required under these Zoning By-laws, notice shall be given
by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town of Seekonk once in each of two
successive weeks, the first publication to be not less than fourteen days before the day of the hearing and
by posting such notice in a conspicuous place in the Town Hall for a period of not less than fourteen days
before the day of such hearing. In all cases where notice to individuals or specific boards or other
agencies is required, notice shall be sent by mail, postage prepaid.
2.4.2 Parties of Interest
“Parties in interest” as used in these Zoning By-laws shall mean the petitioner, abutters, owners of land
directly opposite on any public or private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within three hundred
feet of the property line of the petitioner as they appear on the most recent applicable tax list,
notwithstanding that the land of any such owner is located in another city or town, the Seekonk Planning
Board, and the Planning Board of every abutting city or town. If the applicant owns any parcel of land
adjacent to the parcel for which the permit is sought, ‘parties in interest’ shall also include abutters within
300 feet of the boundary line of any such adjacent parcel. The Assessors maintaining any applicable tax
list shall certify to the Zoning Board of Appeals or the Planning Board the names and addresses of parties
in interest and such certification shall be conclusive for all purposes. The Zoning Board of Appeals or
Planning Board may accept a waiver of notice from, or an affidavit of actual notice to any party in interest
or, in his stead, any successor owner of record who may not have received a notice by mail, and may
order special notice to any such person, giving not less than five nor more than ten additional days to
reply.
2.4.3 Public Hearing Notice Content

the area or premises, street address, if any, or other adequate identification of the location, of the area or
premises which is the subject of the petition, the date, place and time of the public hearing, the subject
matter of the hearing, and the nature of action or relief requested, if any. No such hearing shall be held on
any day on which a state or municipal election, caucus or primary is held in the Town.
2.4.4 Reviewing Agencies
All applications for special permits, petitions for variance, or appeals submitted to the Zoning Board of
Appeals may, at the discretion and upon the request of the permit granting authority be submitted to and
reviewed by the following, and such reviews may be held jointly: the Board of Selectmen, the Board of
Health, the Planning Board, the Building Official, the Superintendent of Public Works, and the
Conservation Commission. Any such board or agency to which said petitions, or appeals, or applications
are referred for review shall make such recommendations as they deem appropriate and shall send copies
thereof to the Zoning Board of Appeals and to the applicant, provided, however, that failure of any such
board or agency to make recommendations within 35 days shall be deemed lack of opposition thereto.
2.5 Repetitive Petitions
Any appeal, application or petition which has been unfavorably and finally acted upon by the Special
Permit Granting Authority or Permit Granting Authority shall not be acted favorably upon within two
years after the date of final unfavorable action unless said Special Permit Granting Authority or Permit
Granting Authority finds, by a vote of four of the five members, that there are specific and material
changes in the conditions upon which the previous unfavorable action was based and shall describe such
changes in the record of proceedings. No favorable action shall occur in such circumstances unless all but
one member of the Planning Board consents thereto after notice is given to parties in interest of the time
and place of the proceedings when the question of such consent by the Planning Board will be considered.
16
Any petition for a variance or application for a special permit which has been transmitted to the Zoning
Board of Appeals may be withdrawn, without prejudice, by the petitioner prior to the publication of the
notice of a public hearing thereon, but thereafter may be withdrawn without prejudice only with the

2.6 Notice of Decision
Upon the granting of a variance or special permit, or any extension, modification, or renewal thereof, the
Zoning Board of Appeals or Planning Board shall issue to the owner and to the applicant, if other than
the owner, a copy of its decision, certified by the relevant Board, containing the name and address of the
owner, identifying the land affected, setting forth compliance with the statutory requirements for the
issuance of such a variance or special permit and certifying that copies of the decision and all plans
referred to in the decision have been filed with the Planning Board and Town Clerk.
No variance, or any extension, modification or renewal thereof, shall take effect until a copy of the
decision bearing the certification of the city or town clerk that twenty days have elapsed after the decision
has been filed in the office of the city or town clerk and no appeal has been filed, or that if such appeal has
been filed, that it has been dismissed or denied, or that if it is a variance which has been approved by
reason of the failure of the permit granting authority or special permit granting authority to act thereon
within the time prescribed, a copy of the petition for the variance accompanied by the certification of the
city or town clerk stating the fact that the permit granting authority failed to act within the time
prescribed, and no appeal has been filed, and that the grant of the petition resulting from such failure to
act has become final, or that if such appeal has been filed, that it has been dismissed or denied, is recorded
in the registry of deeds for the county and district in which the land is located and indexed in the grantor
index under the name of the owner of record or is recorded and noted on the owner’s certificate of title.
A special permit, or any extension, modification or renewal thereof, shall not take effect until a copy of
the decision bearing the certification of the town clerk that twenty (20) days have elapsed after the
decision has been filed in the office of the town clerk and either that no appeal has been filed or the appeal
has been filed within such time, or if it is a special permit which has been approved by reason of the
failure of the permit granting authority or special permit granting authority to act thereon within the time
prescribed, a copy of the application for the special permit-accompanied by the certification of the town
clerk stating the fact that the permit granting authority or special permit granting authority failed to act
within the time prescribed, and whether or not an appeal has been filed within that time, and that the grant
of the application resulting from the failure to act has become final, is recorded in the registry of deeds for
the county and district in which the land is located and indexed in the grantor index under the name of the
owner of record or is recorded and noted on the owner’s certificate of title. The person exercising rights
under a duly appealed special permit does so at risk that a court will reverse the permit and that any
construction performed under the permit may be ordered undone. This section shall in no event terminate
or shorten the tolling, during the pendency of any appeals, of the six (6) month periods provided under the
second paragraph of M.G.L. Chapter 40A Section 6. The fee for recording or registering shall be paid by
the owner or applicant.
2.7 Appeal

Authority or by the failure of either board to act as provided for under G.L. c.40A, §17, ¶1, whether or not
previously a party to the proceedings, or any municipal officer or board may appeal to a court of
competent jurisdiction under G.L. c.40A, §17.
2.8 Site Plan Review
2.8.1 Purpose
17
The purpose of this section is to protect the safety, public health, convenience, and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the Town of Seekonk by providing detailed review of the design and layout of certain
developments which may have a substantial impact upon the character of the Town and upon traffic,
utilities, and services therein.
2.8.2 Powers and Administrative Procedures
All site plans are subject to the review and approval by the Planning Board (hereinafter, in this Section,
the Board). The Board shall impose any conditions they find reasonably appropriate to improve the site
design as based on the design standards below, but shall not have the discretion to prohibit the use. The
Board may adopt and periodically amend rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this By-law.
Failure by them to promulgate such rules and regulations shall not have the effect of suspending or
invalidating this By-law.
2.8.3 Applicability
Any construction or alteration of a non-residential structure or change of use of a building or property to a
non-residential use that would necessitate an on-site change to any of the design standards of Section 8
shall be subject to Site Plan Review. Residential uses shall be exempt from this section.
Notwithstanding the aforesaid, all activities subject to the provisions in Section 6.8 of the Zoning By-law
(Solar Photovoltaic Facility Overlay District) and the associated Site Plan Review process shall not be
subject to Site Plan Review as described in this section.
Where an applicant requires both Zoning Board of Appeals approval and site plan approval for a proposed
use, structure, or development the applicant shall first obtain the require zoning relief prior to appearing
before the Planning Board. Failure of an applicant to obtain necessary zoning relief prior to appearing
before the Planning Board may be grounds for denial of an application.
2.8.4 Pre-Application Review
The applicant is strongly encouraged to request a pre-application review with the Town Planner,
Conservation Agent, Building Official, Health Agent, Fire Chief, Water Superintendent and Public Works
Superintendent. The applicant’s consultants are strongly encouraged to attend. The purpose of this
review is to outline the applicant’s preliminary plan and receive comments from the members of the town
staff listed above so as to minimize the applicant’s costs for engineering and other technical experts that
may arise throughout the development process.
2.8.5 Procedure
Applicants shall submit an application for Site Plan Review in accordance with the rules and regulations
effectuating the purposes of this By-law adopted and periodically amended by the Board. Said
application shall be deemed complete by the Town Planner in accordance with the required items for a
completed application as outlined in the rules and regulations. An application will be deemed either
complete or incomplete within one week of its receipt. The Town Planner shall issue a Certificate of
Completeness for all complete applications which shall note any peer reviews recommended for the
application (or waivers requested by the applicant therefrom) and set an anticipated date for the Planning
Board’s site plan review. Applicants who have submitted incomplete applications will then be notified of
which required items are missing.
Notwithstanding any peer reviews identified by the Town Planner in the Certificate of Completeness.
When reviewing an application for approval, the Board may determine that the assistance of outside
consultants is warranted due to a project’s potential impacts. The cost of such outside consultants shall be
18
borne by the applicant. Review fees shall be in the form of a check made out to the Board’s reviewing
engineer. Said review fee should be forwarded to the Board for payment to the Board’s reviewing
engineer or via a dedicated account established with and administered by the Finance Department.
Where the a property, for which a site plan approval is filed, abuts residential zoned or used property,
notice shall be provided to all abutters, as identified by the Seekonk Tax Assessor, within 300’ of the
property of the time and place of the Planning Board’s review of the application. Said notice shall be
provided at least fourteen (14) days prior to the Planning Board meeting at which the application will be
reviewed and shall be mailed by regular mail by the applicant in a form to be provided by the Planning
Board. Upon completing such mailing the applicant or their representative shall either file an affidavit
attesting to the provision of notice with the Planning Board or enter testimony on the record that such
notice has been accomplished.
Prior to the issuance of a building permit for a project to which site plan review is applicable, a site plan
shall be submitted to the Planning Board for review for compliance with these Zoning By-laws. Such a
building permit shall not be issued without either an approved site plan signed by the Clerk of the Board
that is compliant with any conditions put forth as part of the approval by the Board or by indicated default
approval as follows. If the Planning Board does not act to reject such plan within ninety (90) consecutive
days after receipt of a completed application, it shall be deemed to be acceptable and the site plan shall be
signed “Approved by Default” by the Town Clerk.
Site Plan approvals are valid for one year following the date of approval. Construction shall commence
within this timeframe. A one-year extension can be granted by Board upon receipt of correspondence by
the applicant seeking said extension. Prior to construction, all necessary erosion and sedimentation
control measures shall be in place in accordance with any requirement regulating said measures.
2.8.6 Design Standards
The development and design standards outlined in Section 8, in addition to any standards prescribed
elsewhere in this By-law, shall be utilized by the Board in considering all site plans.
2.8.7 Compliance:
Before the issuance of a permanent occupancy permit by the Building Department, the Town Planner
shall verify compliance with the approved site plan and an as-built plan, certified by a registered
professional land surveyor or engineer, shall be submitted to the Planning Board and Building Official.
The as-built plan shall attest to the development’s conformity to its approved site plan by indicating
landscaping, buildings, drainage flow, number of parking stalls, and limits of parking areas and drives and
other required details. Any deviation from the approved site plan and any deviation from any condition
imposed on the site plan approval shall be prominently noted on the as-built plan.
Any changes in the approved site plan or in the activity to be conducted on the site that would cause a
change to any of the design standards of Section 7 shall be submitted to the Planning Board for review
and approval. The Town Planner may administratively approve any changes to the approved site plan that
do not cause a change in any of the design standards of Section 8.
2.8.8 Appeals
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Board under this section, shall first appeal to the Zoning Board
of Appeals after a building permit decision has been made. Subsequent appeals shall be brought to a
court of competent jurisdiction under G.L. c.40A, §17.

19
The subdivision of land in all districts shall conform to the subdivision regulations as approved by the
Planning Board.

2.11 Enforcement
2.11.1 Building Official
These Zoning By-laws shall be enforced by the Board of Selectmen through the Building Official. The
Building Official shall approve no application, plan, or permit, or the specifications thereof except in
conformity with this By-law.
2.11.2 Building Permits
20
No structure shall hereafter be erected or structurally altered and no premises shall hereafter be changed in
use until a permit authorizing the same shall be issued by the Building Official. The Building Official
shall withhold a permit for the construction, alteration or moving or any building or structure if the
building or structure as constructed, altered, or moved would be in violation of these Zoning By-laws. No
permit shall be granted for a new use of a building, structure, or land which use would be in violation of
this By-law. If the Building Official is requested in writing to enforce this By-law against any person
allegedly in violation of the same and declines to act, he shall notify, in writing, the party requesting such
enforcement of any action or refusal to act, and the reasons therefore, within thirty days of receipt of such
request or within a reasonable time thereafter if the Official needs to obtain more information.
Any application for a building permit shall be accompanied by plans and specifications in duplicate
showing the actual shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the exact location and size of all
buildings or structures already on the lot, the applicable yard dimensions, together with the lines within
which all buildings or structures are to be erected, the existing and intended use of each building or
structure, and such other information as may be necessary under the provisions of these Zoning By-laws
to provide for its execution and enforcement.
A record of all such applications, plans, and permits shall be kept on file by the Building Official.
2.11.3 Construction and Operation Standards Data
The Building Official may require the submission both of plans of any proposed machinery, operations
and products and of specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used in restricting the
emission of dangerous and objectionable elements referred to in Sections 4.2 and 8.12. The Building
Official may also require an affidavit from the applicant acknowledging his/her/its understanding of the
applicable performance standards of Sections 4.2 and 8.12, and his/her/its agreement to conform with the
same at all times. No applicant will be required to reveal any secret processes, and any information will
be treated as confidential to the extent allowed; however, all documents should be presumed to be a public
record that is required to be disclosed upon request unless a statutory exemption exists to the requirement
for disclosure upon request.
If there is any reasonable doubt concerning the likelihood of conformance with the performance standards
of Sections 4.2 and 8.12, the Building Official shall deny the application and refer the applicant to the
Board of Appeals, which shall take action in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1.2.
2.12 Amendment
These Zoning By-laws or any portion thereof may be amended, modified, or repealed in the following
manner:
2.12.1 Initiation
Change of Zoning By-laws may be initiated by the submission to the Board of Selectmen, by the Zoning
Board of Appeals, by an individual owning land to be affected by the change, by request of registered
voters of the town pursuant of Section 10 of Chapter 39 of the General Laws, by the Planning Board, by
the Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic Development District, or by other methods provided
by municipal charter. The Board of Selectmen shall, within fourteen days of receipt of such Zoning Bylaw,
submit it to the Planning Board for review.
2.12.2 Public Hearing
No Zoning By-law or amendment thereto shall be adopted until after the Planning Board has held a public
hearing thereon at which interested persons shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Said public hearing
21
shall be held within sixty-five days after the proposed Zoning By-law is submitted to the Planning Board
by the Board of Selectmen. Notice of time and place of such public hearing, of the subject matter,
sufficient for identification, and of the place where texts and maps thereof may be inspected shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the town once in each of two successive weeks, the first
publication to be not less than fourteen days before the day of the hearing and by posting such notice in a
conspicuous place in the Town Hall for a period of not less than fourteen days before the day of said
hearing. Notice of said hearing shall also be sent by mail, postage prepaid, to the Department of
Community and Housing Development Affairs, the Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic
Development District and the Planning Boards of all abutting cities and towns. Notice also may be sent to
all abutters within 300 feet of parcel boundary/boundaries affected by the proposed amendment. Notices
mailed to abutters shall be in the form of certified mail return receipt requested and shall be prepared by
the applicant for the zoning amendment. Said notices shall then be forwarded to the Planning Board for
mailing.
A separate, conspicuous statement shall be included with property tax bills sent to non-resident property
owners, stating that notice of hearings under this By-law shall be sent by mail, postage prepaid, to any
such owner who files an annual request for such notice with the Town Clerk no later than January first,
and pays a fee of five dollars per annum. In cases involving boundary or use changes within a district,
notice shall be sent without charge to any such nonresident property owner who has filed such a request
with the Town Clerk and whose property lies in the district where the change is sought. No defect in the
form of any notice required under G.L. c.40A, §5 or under these Zoning By-laws shall invalidate any
Zoning By-laws unless such defect is found to be misleading.
2.12.3 Town Meeting Action
No vote to adopt any such proposed amendment to these Zoning By-laws shall be taken, except as
provided for under G.L. c.40A, §5 (i.e., until a report with recommendations by the Planning Board has
been submitted to Town Meeting or twenty-one (21)days have elapsed after such hearing without
submission of such report or recommendations). After such notice, hearing and report, or after twentyone
days shall have lapsed after such hearing without submission of such report, a Town Meeting may
adopt, reject, or amend these Zoning By-laws. If a Town Meeting fails to vote to adopt any proposed
amendment to the Zoning By-laws within six months after such hearing, no action shall be taken thereon
by Town Meeting until after a subsequent public hearing is held with notice and an opportunity to report
by the Planning Board as above provided.
No amendment to these Zoning By-laws shall be adopted under G.L. c.40A, §5, except by a minimum 2/3
vote of a Town Meeting.
2.12.4 Reconsideration
No proposed Zoning By-law which has been unfavorably acted upon by a Town Meeting shall be
considered by Town Meeting within two years after the date of such unfavorable action unless the
adoption of such proposed By-law is recommended in the final report of the Planning Board.
2.12.5 Submission to Attorney General
When Zoning By-laws or amendments thereto are submitted to the Attorney General for approval as
required by Section 32 of Chapter 40A of the General Laws, he or she may also be furnished with a
statement prepared by the Planning Board explaining the By-laws or amendments proposed, which
statement may be accompanied by explanatory maps or plans if appropriate.
2.12.6 Effective Date of Amendment
22
The effective date of the amendment of the Zoning By-laws shall be the date on which such amendment
was voted upon by a Town Meeting and its application to particular uses and structures shall be as
otherwise provided under G.L. c.40A.
2.13 Penalty for Violations
Violation of any provision of these Zoning By-laws shall be subject to a fine pursuant to Category 39 of
the Town of Seekonk General By-laws and G.L. c.40, §21D.

4.3.2 Extension
Lawfully nonconforming structures or uses may be extended or altered by special permit upon a finding
by the SPGA that such change, extension, or alteration shall not be substantially more detrimental than
the lawfully nonconforming structure or use to the neighborhood. However, in the Residential 4 (R-4)
zoning district, where a pre-existing lot of record, having not less than 75% of the required frontage
(150’), and otherwise meeting the area requirements as set forth for the “alternate minimum standard” in
footnote 3 to Section 5.1.4 Dimensional Table a lawfully nonconforming structure or use may be
extended or altered by right, without the grant of a special permit by the Zoning Board of Appeals, subject
to all other requirements and standards as set forth in this By-law.
Lawfully nonconforming structures or land used for the primary purpose of agriculture, horticulture, or
floriculture on parcels of more than five acres in size may be expanded or reconstructed even if it
prolongs the use of a nonconforming structure. However, the reconstruction or expansion shall conform
to the dimensional regulations for the district if such regulations would not prohibit the re-establishment
of the agricultural use or structure. For such purposes land divided by a public or private way or
waterway shall be construed as one parcel.
4.3.3 Exemptions
The following buildings, structures or use of land, building, or structures are exempted from the
provisions of this section:
4.3.3.1 Lawfully nonconforming structures and Uses and building and special permits
issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing on a Zoning Bylaw
or amendment that would cause the structure or use to become nonconforming.
Construction or operations under a building or special permit shall conform to any subsequent
amendment of these Zoning By-laws unless the use or construction is commenced within a
period of not more than six months after the issuance of the permit, and, in cases involving
construction, unless such construction is continued through to completion as continuously and
expeditiously as is reasonable.
34
4.3.3.2 Alteration, reconstruction, extension, or structural change to a single or twofamily
residential structure where such action(s) does not increase the
nonconforming nature of said structure.
4.3.3.3 Any increase in area, frontage, width, yard or depth requirements of these
Zoning By-laws shall not apply to a lot for single and two-family residential use
which, at the time of recording or endorsement, whichever occurs sooner, was not
held in common ownership with any adjoining land, conformed to then existing
requirements and has less than the proposed requirement but at least 5,000 square
feet of area and fifty feet of frontage, as provided for under G.L. c.40A, §6, ¶4.
4.3.3.4 If two or more adjacent nonconforming lots are in the same ownership on the
date of adoption of these Zoning By-laws, and such combination of nonconforming
lots, or a portion thereof, constitutes a lot of minimum size as defined in Section
5.1.4 of this By-law, such combinations or portions shall be considered as merged in
conformance with the requirements of this By-law and no structure may be
constructed on the individual portions. If such combination of the portions does not
contain sufficient area to permit conformance with Section 5.1.4, a structure may be
constructed thereon, either in accordance with G.L. c.40A, §6, ¶4 or subject to the
special permit approval by the Board of Appeals.
4.3.4 Discontinuance or Abandonment of a Nonconforming Use
No lawfully nonconforming building, structure or use, other than an agriculture, horticulture, or
floriculture use, which has been abandoned or ceased to be used for two years or more shall again be
devoted to a nonconforming use.
No lawfully nonconforming agricultural, horticultural, or floricultural use on a parcel of five acres or less
in size in areas not zoned for agriculture, horticulture, or floriculture which has ceased for more than five
years shall be devoted again to a nonconforming use, unless the use is protected under G.L. c.40A, §3.
The involuntary interruption of a nonconforming use or destruction of a nonconforming structure, such as
by fire or natural catastrophe does not establish an intent to abandon a nonconforming use. However, the
two and five year abandonment periods referenced in the preceding two paragraphs of this section shall
remain applicable even in the event of an involuntary interruption of the non-conforming use or damage
or destruction of a nonconforming structure. A nonconforming structure destroyed or otherwise damaged
by fire or natural catastrophe may be repaired or rebuilt to the same size and dimension as previously
existed but may only be expanded in conformance with this By-law.
Section 5. DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
5.1 General Standards
5.1.1 No lot, yard, frontage, required open space, or parking area shall be so reduced,
diminished, or maintained such that the resulting yards, other open spaces, total lot area, or
parking area shall be smaller than prescribed by these Zoning By-laws. After the date of
adoption of these Zoning By-laws, land in all residence districts shall be subdivided only so
that every lot shall conform to these Zoning By-laws.
5.1.2 No part of a yard, parking space, or other open space required for any building or use for
the purpose of complying with the provisions of this By-law shall be included as part of a
35
yard, parking space, or other open space required under this By-law for another building
except as provided in Section 2.8.
5.1.3 Each residential unit, be it in a single or multi-unit structure, be it fixed or mobile, be it
permanent or temporary, shall meet or exceed, either individually or in combined totals, the
minimum lot area requirements of this By-law for the residential zone in which the unit exists.
If the residential unit is in other than a residential zone, it shall meet or exceed the minimum
lot area requirements of the least restricted residential zone. This is not authorization of any
particular form of residential unit, but is a mandatory requirement for any residential unit not
specifically covered by these By-laws.

1In any district, a lot having frontages on two streets that do not intersect shall have two front yards each of a depth as provided in this By-law.
2 In any residence district, the required front yard of any residence hereafter erected shall conform to the average alignment of any existing dwellings on the
same side of the street within 250 feet except that no residence shall have a front yard of less than 10 feet in depth or need have a front yard of greater depth
than 50 feet in an R-4 District or 50 feet in an R-3 District or 35 feet in an R-2 District or 35 feet in an R-1 District.
3Alternate to Standard Minimums in Residential Districts: this alternate is offered to encourage more normally acceptable lot configurations, increased open
space, decreased density, reduced lengths of roads, utilities and drains, and to legalize potential nonconforming uses:
? The minimum lot area shall be increased by 250 square feet for each foot, or fraction thereof, of reduction of the minimum frontage measured at the
street line.
? The minimum frontage may be reduced to not less than 75% of the standard minimum of the affected zone, but not to less than 100 feet.
? Any lot designed under this alternate shall be prominently identified on plans submitted for approval and/or endorsement.
4However, with respect to buildings or structures used for municipal purposes, including water and sewerage, no restrictions relative to height shall apply.
5 All new lots for development created pursuant to the Subdivision Control Law, MGL Chapter 41, §§81K-81GG in the R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones shall be
designed geometrically as to show a 100 foot square resting at the midpoint of the setback line at its perpendicular. All new lots for development created
pursuant to the Subdivision Control Law, MGL Chapter 41, §§81K-81GG in the R-1 zone shall be designed geometrically as to show a 60 foot square
resting at the midpoint of the setback line at its perpendicular.
6When a side yard adjoins a lot in a residence district, the side yard shall be of the same width as the required side yard in the more restrictive district.
7The side and rear yard adjoining any district or use shall include a minimum of 15 feet around any buildings. This includes appurtenances extending out
from any building, or other items, which in the opinion of the Planning Board unduly constitute an obstruction or which impeded safe vehicular travel by
current emergency vehicles.
8When a rear yard abuts a lot in a residence district, the rear yard shall be of the same depth as the required more restrictive yard, side or rear. When a rear
yard abuts a street, the rear yard shall be of sufficient depth to provide the required off-street loading space.
9Except along boundaries abutting railroad tracks.
10Minimum side and rear yards when adjacent to a residence district shall be 50 feet.
11Whichever is less.
12 For lots within the Water Resource Protection District see Section 6.4 for additional dimensional requirements

5.2 Location of Detached Private Garages and Other Detached Accessory Buildings
A detached garage or other accessory buildings other than roadside stands shall not be located in any
required front or side yard, or within ten feet of any rear lot line, or within ten feet from any other
building. However, the words “within ten feet of any rear lot line” do not apply to garden/yard sheds of
200 square feet or less.
Accessory farm buildings, except roadside stands, shall be located at least 60 feet from any dwelling.
Roadside stands shall be located at least 25 feet from any street line.
5.3 Location of Attached Garages and Carports

distance provided herein for the main building.
Section 6. OVERLAY AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS
6.1 Planned Unit Development District
6.1.1 Definition and Intent
A planned unit development district means a non-residential mixed use development on a plot of land
containing a minimum of the greater of sixty thousand square feet or five times the minimum lot size of
the zoning district in which a mixture of commercial uses or a mixture of industrial uses and a variety of
building types are determined to be sufficiently advantageous to render it appropriate to grant special
permission to depart from the normal requirements of the district to the extent authorized by these Bylaws.
Planned unit development districts may be for commercial use - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
DISTRICT COMMERCIAL - or industrial use - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
INDUSTRIAL. Such districts may be established from time to time in such a manner as best to fit the
general pattern of land use established by these By-laws and to constitute a harmonious, efficient, and
convenient commercial or industrial center.
Planned unit development districts shall be established by process of amendment.
6.1.2 Site Plan Prerequisite for Approval
Any amendment to this Zoning By-law by which a planned district may be established shall be adopted in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of this By-law and only after a site plan for said district
shall have been reviewed and given final approval by the Seekonk Planning Board. Any such adoption
shall become effective only after the site plan has been recorded with the Planning Board and Bristol
County Registry of Deeds. Site plans as recorded may be revised provided such revisions are approved
by the Town authority having appropriate jurisdiction, after a public hearing and after such revisions shall
have been recorded with the Planning Board and the Bristol County Registry of Deeds.
6.1.3 Content of Site Plan
A site plan for a planned district shall be certified by a Registered Land Surveyor, Professional
Engineer, Landscape Architect, or Architect, and it shall indicate the location of main and accessory
buildings on the site and the relation of one to another, the traffic circulation features within and without
the site, the height and bulk of buildings, the provision of off-street parking and loading spaces, the
location of other open spaces on the site, the location and design of signs, and the description of uses of
buildings and areas, provided, however, that the uses of buildings and areas which by virtue of the
design of the building or area may be occupied by more than one type of enterprise need not be
designated.
6.1.3.1 A site plan for a planned district commercial shall provide:
39
a.) Front, side, and rear yards of depth at least as great as those required in highway business
districts.
b.) A wall of solid appearance or tight evergreen hedge at least six (6) feet high to be erected
and maintained in any side or rear yard adjacent to a residence district.
c.) Paved parking areas in a ratio of at least four square feet of parking area (including
driveways) for each one square foot of gross floor area designed for retail business or
service establishment use and excluding basement storage area.
6.1.3.2 A site plan for a planned district industrial shall provide:
a.) Front, side, and rear yards of depths at least as great as those required in industry districts.

and convenience of traffic movement, both within the area covered by the plan and in
relation to access streets, and harmonious and beneficial relations between the planned
district and contiguous and adjacent neighborhoods.
6.1.4 Duration of Approval
Any amendment to this By-law by which a planned district is established shall cease to be in effect three
years from the date of its adoption unless a building permit for construction in the planned district shall
have been taken out. The zoning classification of any planned district, which has ceased to be in effect,
shall revert to the classification in effect before the adoption of the appropriate planned district
amendment.
6.2 Wetlands and Floodplain Protection District
6.2.1 Purpose and Intent
The purpose of the Wetlands and Floodplain Protection District is as follows:

6.2.4.3 Special Permit Procedure
The applicant shall file for a Special Permit in accordance with Section 2.2, Special
Permits, of these By-laws.
6.2.5 Administration
This By-law shall be administered by the Building Official as follows:
6.2.5.1 Review proposed development within the Wetlands and Floodplain Protection District
to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies
from which approval is required by Federal or State Law.
6.2.5.2 Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be
reasonably safe from flooding.
6.2.5.3 Obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data from a federal,
state, or other source as criteria for requiring that all new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development in Zone A and other special flood hazard areas meet
the requirements of these By-laws. All new subdivision proposals or any development
greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, any portion of which is in the
floodplain of Zone A, shall include base flood elevation data based on the Hundred Year
Storm. In Zones A and AE, along watercourses that have not had a regulatory floodway
designated, the best available Federal, State, local, or other floodway data shall be used to
prohibit encroachments in floodways which would result in any increase in flood levels
within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
6.2.5.4 Obtain the elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor, including
basement, of all new or substantially improved structures. Also determine whether the
structure has been flood proofed, and if so, the elevation to which it was flood proofed.
6.2.5.5 Prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, notify adjacent affected
communities and the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, and also
submit copies of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency Region I
office.
6.2.5.6 Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any
watercourse is maintained.
6.2.5.7 No occupancy permit shall be issued until all Boards with jurisdiction under this
By-law have given written notice to the issuing officer that they are satisfied with
compliance by the applicant with this By-law. Failure by any Board to respond within 21
days to a written request from the issuing officer for an opinion on compliance will
constitute agreed compliance by the requested Board.
43
6.2.5.8 All development in the district, including structural and non-structural activities,
whether permitted by right or by special permit must be in compliance with Chapter 131,
Section 40 of the Massachusetts General Laws and with the following:
a.) Section of the Massachusetts State Building Code which addresses floodplain and coastal
high hazard areas (currently 780 CMR);
b.) Wetlands Protection Regulations, Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
(currently 310 CMR 10.00);

8.11 Additional Site Plan Standards for the Local Business District, Mixed Use Overlay District
and Luther’s Corners Village District
8.11.1 Front yards shall not be used for parking. The parking standards in section 8.1.3 can be
waived by the Planning Board if in the Board’s opinion they will have a detrimental effect on
the neighborhood character.
8.11.2 Front, side, or rear yards of commercial and mixed use buildings may be used as seasonal
outdoor seating areas for businesses, provided that such areas are regularly cleaned and
maintained, with trash removed on a daily basis. Seasonal outdoor seating areas may be
installed during warm weather months. All related temporary furnishings and fixtures,
including but not limited to tables, chairs, umbrellas, light fixtures, freestanding signs and
menu boards, etc., shall be stored indoors off season; however any fencing, bollards, planters,
or other means of delineating the boundaries of such outdoor seating areas may remain in
place permanently.
8.11.3 Service alleys shall be provided behind mixed-use, commercial, or multi-family residential
buildings to provide access for parking, loading, and garbage collection. Alleys will typically
be narrower than primary streets and need not include sidewalks, street trees, or parking lanes.

shall be A.D.A. compliant.
8.11.6 All streets trees shall be planted in a landscaped belt at least 5 feet wide between the street
curb and the sidewalk. New development should consider utilizing existing mature trees for
this purpose, particularly if such trees already frame or can be used to frame an important
vista. New trees shall have a minimum 4-inch caliper at a level of 4 feet above grade, and
shall be planted at intervals of approximately 40 feet or less. Hardy, climate-appropriate,
deciduous species that will grow to a mature height of approximately 60 feet and will provide
shade are preferred; smaller, ornamental trees may be interspersed with larger trees. Lower
branches shall be trimmed to a height of at least 7 feet, so as not to interfere with pedestrians
and to provide good visibility for drivers.
8.11.7 Buildings may vary in size and form and should provide that a comfortable pedestrian scale is
maintained; variety in massing is specifically encouraged in developments containing multiple
buildings. Vertical proportions are generally preferred, especially for windows and doors on
horizontally massed buildings. Buildings with 100 feet or more of frontage should utilize
design techniques that will create the appearance of a several smaller buildings, such as
variations in the plane of the façade, in materials, in ornamentation, and/or in fenestration
patterns (windows and doors).

buildings within individual lots to provide visual interest along the streetscape.
8.11.9 A variety of roof lines is encouraged, including front gable, side gable, hip, and flat (with or
without a parapet), particularly where buildings are to be sited close together within the same
development. All buildings shall have a defined cornice.
8.11.10 Dormers are permitted on residential and mixed use buildings, provided that the ridge of any
dormer shall be below the ridge of the main roof.
8.11.11 Buildings sited at the intersection of two or more streets may have a clock tower at the
corner(s) nearest that intersection(s), to create a focal point on a streetscape. The height of any
such clock tower shall not exceed 55 feet.
8.11.12 All buildings shall be designed with varied and articulated facades to provide visual interest;
decorative patterning in exterior wall materials should be considered. Long expanses of blank
walls facing the street or public open space are not permitted, either on the ground floor or on
upper floors. Where building frontage along a street is greater than 100 feet, architectural
elements such as vertical piers, bay windows, and recessed entrances should be used to
maintain pedestrian scale.
8.11.13 Mixed use and non-residential buildings shall provide continuous storefronts at the ground
floor level, with at least sixty percent (60%) of the storefront containing transparent clear
glass. Storefront windows may either provide views into the interior space used by a business,
92
or be used for display only, enclosed on the interior by opaque walls. Storefront entrances
may be recessed.
8.11.14 Awnings and/or Canopies may be provided above storefront windows and entrances, and may
incorporate signage for a business. Preferred materials are opaque canvas, metal, or glass.

9.2 Conservation Subdivision Design
9.2.1 Purposes
The purposes of Conservation Subdivision Design are:
1. To encourage the preservation of open land for its scenic beauty and to enhance agricultural,
open space, forestry, and recreational use;
2. To preserve historical and archeological resources;
3. To protect the natural environment;
4. To protect the value of real property;
5. To promote more sensitive siting of buildings and better overall site planning;
6. To perpetuate the appearance of Seekonk’s traditional New England natural landscape;
7. To allow landowners a reasonable return on their investment; and
8. To facilitate the construction and maintenance of streets, utilities and public services in a
more economical and efficient manner.
9.2.2 Applicability
Any subdivision of five (5) or more lots, from a parcel or set of contiguous parcels held in common
ownership and located within a Residence District other than an R-1 zoning district may be permitted by
right as a Conservation Subdivision upon approval by the Planning Board (Board).
94
9.2.3 Pre-application Review
The applicant is strongly encouraged to request a pre-application review with the Town Planner,
Conservation Agent, Building Official, Health Agent, Fire Chief, Water Superintendent and Public Works
Superintendent. The applicant’s consultants are strongly encouraged to attend. The purpose of this
review is to outline the applicant’s preliminary plan and receive comments from the members of the town
staff listed above so as to minimize the applicant’s costs for engineering and other technical experts that
may arise throughout the development process.
9.2.4 Procedures
Applicants for a Conservation Subdivision shall file with the Board a Preliminary Plan and Definitive
Plan, conforming to the contents specified in the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of
Land in Seekonk, Massachusetts.
9.2.5 Number of Dwelling Units
The maximum number of dwelling units allowed shall be equal to the number of lots which could
reasonably be expected to be developed upon that parcel under a conventional plan in full conformance
with all zoning, subdivision regulations, health regulations, wetlands regulations, and other applicable
requirements. The Board shall review the proposed maximum number of dwelling units through the
submittal of a Yield Plan as described in the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in
Seekonk, Massachusetts.
9.2.6 Site Design Process
Each Development Plan shall follow a four-step design process, as described below. When the
Development Plan is submitted, applicants shall be prepared to demonstrate to the Board that these four
design steps were followed by their site designers in determining the layout of their proposed streets,
house lots, and open space.
9.2.6.1 Designing the open space. First, the open space is identified. The open space shall include,
to the extent feasible, the most sensitive and noteworthy natural, scenic, and cultural
resources on the property as identified on plans submitted to the Board through the
subdivision review process.
9.2.6.2 Location of house sites. Second, potential house sites are tentatively located. House sites
should be located not closer than 100 feet to wetlands areas, but may be situated within 50
feet of open space areas, in order to enjoy views of the latter without negatively impacting
the former.
9.2.6.3 Street and lot layout. Third, align the proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each
house in the most reasonable and economical way. When lots, access, and streets are laid
out, they shall be located in a way that avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on open
space. To the greatest extent practicable, wetland crossing and streets traversing existing
slopes over 15% shall be avoided.
9.2.6.4 Lot lines. Fourth, draw in the lot lines. These are generally drawn midway between house
locations.
9.2.7 Site Design Standards
9.2.7.1 Streets shall be designed and located in such a manner as to maintain and preserve natural
topography, significant landmarks, and trees; to minimize cut and fill; and to preserve and
enhance views and vistas on or off the subject parcel.
95
9.2.7.2 The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing
tree and soil removal/alteration. Any grade changes shall be in keeping with the general
appearance of the neighboring developed areas.
9.2.7.3 All open space shall be designed to add to the visual amenities of the area by maximizing
its visibility for persons passing the site or overlooking it from nearby properties.
9.2.7.4 The removal or disruption of historic, traditional, or significant uses, structures, or
architectural elements shall be minimized insofar as practicable, whether these exist on the
site or on adjacent properties.
9.2.7.5 Building orientation for residential uses shall be such that at least 75% or more of the
buildings shall have one axis at least 1.5 times longer than the other, and such that the
longer axis is within 15 degrees of the geographical east/west axis. The length to width
ratio shall be applied only to the length of walls enclosing conditioned spaces; walls
enclosing unconditioned spaces such as garages, arcades, or porches shall not be counted in
these calculations.
9.2.7.6 Where a building meets the standard for subsection 5 above, the roof shall be designed so
that that any protuberances, dormers or other features shall not preclude the future
installation of solar power generating technology.
9.2.7.7 Walkways, trails, and bicycle paths shall be provided to link residences with recreation
facilities (including parkland and open space) and adjacent land uses where appropriate.
9.2.8 Lot Dimensions
Each lot shall contain not less than 15,000 square feet of area if serviced by town water and not less than
20,000 square feet if not serviced by town water. Said lots shall have frontage of not less than 50 feet,
front yards of at least 20 feet and rear, and side yards of at least 10 feet.
9.2.9 Access to Lots
Lots within a Conservation Subdivision may only be accessed from roads within the subdivision except as
may be authorized by the Planning Board pursuant to Section 7.2.1.3 of the Rules and Regulations
governing the Subdivision of the Land in the Town of Seekonk.
9.2.10 Minimum Open Space Requirements
A minimum amount of dedicated open space is required as part of any Conservation Subdivision in
accordance with the following table and shall meet all the requirements of this By-law for design,
restriction of use, and ownership. The percentage of this open space that can be wetland shall not exceed
the percentage of wetland for the entire site under existing conditions shown on the Development Plan.
Land area within any regulated buffer areas to wetlands or waterways shall not be counted toward
computation of the existing wetland area.
District Minimum Dedicated Open Space
R-2 40%
R-3 50%
R-4 60%
9.2.11 Design of Open Space
Dedicated open space in any Conservation Subdivision shall meet the following design standards:
96
9.2.11.1 Open space shall not include required yards and buffer areas and shall not consist of narrow
strips of land around the perimeter of the site which do not meet the intent of this By-law.
9.2.11.2 As part of the subdivision review process, the Board may require interconnected open space
on adjacent subdivisions to encourage biodiversity by maximizing habitat size and
minimizing edge effects. Such open space may be separated by the road(s) constructed
within the Conservation Subdivision.
9.2.11.3 A physical demarcation between residential properties and the required open space shall be
included to prevent said open space from being absorbed by adjacent residential properties.
Suggested examples include split rail fences, stone walls, boulders or other impediments as
approved by the Board.
9.2.12 Allowable Uses within Dedicated Open Space
The required open space shall be used for conservation, historic preservation, agriculture,
horticulture, forestry, or for a combination of these uses, and shall be served by suitable access
for such purposes. Existing underground utilities, as of the date of adoption of this section, to
serve the Conservation Subdivision site may be located within the required open space.
9.2.13 Ownership of Dedicated Space
The required open space shall, at the owner’s election, be owned by any of the following
entities:
9.2.13.1 A private owner for agricultural, horticultural, forestry or any other purpose not inconsistent
with the conservation restriction;
9.2.13.2 A non-profit organization or agency of the Commonwealth, with their consent, whose
principal purpose is the conservation of open space for any of the purposes set forth herein;
9.2.13.3 The Town of Seekonk Conservation Commission; or
9.2.13.4 A homeowners association (HOA) as defined in the Zoning By-law owned jointly or in
common by the owners of lots or units within the project.
9.2.13.5 If option four is selected the following shall apply:
a.) The documents organizing the HOA shall be drafted and approved by the Board before
final approval of the Conservation Development, recorded prior to the issuance of building
permits, comply with all applicable provisions of state law, and pass with conveyance of
the lots or units in perpetuity. Each individual deed, and the deed, trust, or articles of
incorporation, shall include language designed to effect these provisions.
b.) Membership must be mandatory for each property owner, who must be required by
recorded covenants and restrictions to pay fees to the HOA for taxes, insurance, and
maintenance of common open space, private roads, and other common facilities.
c.) The HOA must be responsible in perpetuity for liability insurance, property taxes, the
maintenance of recreational and other facilities, private roads, and any shared driveways.
d.) Property owners must pay their pro rata share of the costs in subsection c above, and the
assessment levied by the HOA must be able to become a lien upon individual properties
within the Conservation Development.
e.) The HOA must be able to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs.
97
f.) The applicant shall make a conditional grant to the Town of Seekonk, binding upon the
HOA, of the fee interest to all open space to be conveyed to the HOA. Such offer may be
accepted by the Town of Seekonk, at the discretion of the Board of Selectmen, upon the
failure of the HOA to take title to the open space from the applicant or other current owner,
upon dissolution of the association at any future time, or upon failure of the HOA to fulfill
its maintenance obligations hereunder or to pay its real property taxes.
g.) Ownership shall be structured in such a manner that real property taxing authorities may
satisfy property tax claims against the open space lands by proceeding against individual
property owners in the HOA and the dwelling units they each own.
h.) Municipal counsel must find that the HOA documents presented satisfy the conditions in
subsections a through g above, and such other conditions as the Board shall deem
necessary.
9.2.13.6 Selection of ownership option one, two, or four requires:
a.) The conveyance of a conservation restriction as outlined herein; and
b.) The granting of an access easement over such land sufficient to ensure its perpetual
maintenance as agricultural, conservation, or recreation land. Such easement shall provide
that in the event the trust or other owner fails to maintain the open space in reasonable
condition, the Town of Seekonk may, after notice to the lot owners and public hearing,
enter upon such land to maintain it in order to prevent or abate a nuisance. The cost of
such maintenance by the Town of Seekonk shall be assessed against the properties within
the development and/or to the owner of the open space. Pursuant to G.L. Chapter 40
Section 58 the Town of Seekonk may file a lien against the lot or lots to ensure payment
for such maintenance. Pursuant to G.L. Chapter 40 Section 57 the Town of Seekonk may
also deny any application for, or revoke or suspend a building permit or any local license
or permit, due to neglect or refusal by any property owner to pay any maintenance
assessments levied.
9.2.14 Maintenance of Open Space
The Board shall require the establishment of ongoing maintenance standards as a condition of
development approval to ensure that utilities are properly maintained and the open space land is not used
for storage or dumping of refuse, junk, or other offensive or hazardous materials. Such standards shall be
enforceable by the Town against any owner of open space land, including an HOA. If the Board of
Selectmen finds that the maintenance provisions are being violated to the extent that the condition of the
utilities or the open land constitutes a public nuisance, it may, upon 30 days written notice to the owner,
enter the premises for necessary maintenance, and the cost of such maintenance by the Town shall be
assessed ratably against the landowner or, in the case of an HOA, the owners of properties within the
development, and shall, if unpaid, become a property tax lien on such property or properties.
9.2.15 Density Bonus Option
9.2.15.1 Eligible Projects: For any proposed Conservation Subdivision of 8 or more units that is not
within the Groundwater Aquifer Protection District, the developer may voluntarily elect to
provide affordable housing units and receive a density bonus upon grant of a special permit
by the Planning Board. The Planning Board shall require as a condition of such a density
bonus the following:
98
a.) The provision within the Conservation Subdivision of affordable housing units amounting
to a minimum of ten (10) percent of the development's total number of dwelling units.
Fractions of a unit will be rounded up to the next whole number.
b.) The affordable units to be provided shall be equivalent in size, quality, and characteristics
to the other units in the development.
c.) The affordable units shall not be grouped together; they shall be distributed among all
units.
9.2.15.2 Alternative Provision of Units: The Planning Board may allow, as a condition of said
density bonus that, in lieu of all or some of the affordable housing units being provided
within the Conservation Subdivision, the developer shall:
a.) Provide all or some of the affordable housing units on a site different from the
Conservation Subdivision; or
b.) Provide all or some of the affordable housing units through an alternative means, such as
the purchase of existing units with the addition of deed restrictions or some other legally
enforceable instrumentality acceptable to the Planning Board ensuring its continuing
affordability; or
c.) Provide the equivalent value of all or some of the affordable housing units through a “feein-
lieu” paid to the Town of Seekonk’s Community Preservation Act Community Housing
fund, which will be dedicated to the provision of affordable housing; or
d.) Provide all or some of the affordable housing units through a combination of any or all of
the methods in this Section.
e.) The Planning Board shall ensure that the affordable units to be provided through
alternative methods shall be equivalent in size, quality, and characteristics to the units
within in the Conservation Subdivision. The Planning Board will also ensure that these
alternative methods will encourage the most appropriate use of land and buildings, and/or
will avoid undue hardship to land and buildings.
f.) The value of a “fee-in-lieu” payment shall be equal to the price of a unit that is affordable
to a qualified purchaser, assuming a household size of 1.49 persons per bedroom.
Bedrooms will be determined by the average number of bedrooms per unit in the
Conservation Subdivision. In the case of multiple affordable units, the price shall be
multiplied by the number of affordable units created by the Conservation Subdivision.
9.2.15.3 Density Bonus: Under the voluntary special permit, the Planning Board will allow an
increase in the maximum number of on-site market rate dwelling units in the Conservation
Subdivision established under Section 9.2.5 of this By-law. The number of these bonus
market rate units will be equal to the number of affordable units created by the
Conservation Subdivision. Fractions of a unit will be rounded up to the next whole
number.
9.2.15.4 Schedule/Timing of construction or provision of affordable units or lots: The Planning
Board may impose conditions on the special permit requiring construction of affordable
housing according to a specified time table, so that affordable housing units shall be
provided coincident to the development of market-rate units, but in no event shall the
development of affordable units be delayed beyond the schedule noted below:
99
MARKET-RATE UNIT % AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT %
Up to 30% None required
30% plus 1 unit At least 10%
Up to 50% At least 30%
Up to 75% At least 50%
75% plus 1 unit At least 70%
Up to 90% 100%
9.2.15.5 Qualified Purchasers/Tenants: To ensure that only eligible households purchase or lease
affordable housing units, the purchaser or lessee shall be required to submit copies of
his/her household’s last three years’ federal and state income tax returns and certify, in
writing and prior to transfer of title, to the developer of the Conservation Subdivision or
his/her agent, and within thirty (30) days following transfer of title, to the Seekonk Housing
Authority, that his/her household’s annual income level does not exceed the maximum level
as established by the Commonwealth’s Department of Housing and Community
Development, and as may be revised from time to time. The maximum housing cost for
affordable units created under this By-law is as established by the Commonwealth’s
Department of Housing and Community Development, Local Initiative Program or as
revised by the Town.
9.2.15.6 Preservation of Affordability: Each affordable housing unit created in accordance with this
subsection and offered for sale or rent to the general public shall have deed restrictions or
some other legally enforceable instrumentality acceptable to the Planning Board ensuring
its continuing affordability in perpetuity.
a.) Resale Price: Sales beyond the initial sale to a qualified affordable income purchaser shall
include the initial discount rate between the sale price and the unit’s appraised value at the
time of resale. This percentage shall be recorded as part of the deed restriction or other
chosen legally enforceable instrumentality on the property.
b.) Right of first refusal: The purchaser of an affordable housing unit developed as a result of
this By-law shall agree to execute a deed rider prepared by the Town, consistent with
model riders prepared by Department of Housing and Community Development, granting
the municipality’s right of first refusal to purchase the property in the event that a
subsequent qualified purchaser cannot be located.
9.2.16 Decision
The Board may approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a Conservation Subdivision,
after assessing whether the Conservation Subdivision better promotes the objectives herein, than would a
conventional subdivision.
9.2.17 Relation to Other Requirements
The submittals and permits of this section shall be in addition to any other requirements of the
Subdivision Control Law or any other provisions of this Zoning By-law.

SECTION IV
PRELIMINARY PLAN
4.1 General - A Preliminary Plan for a residential subdivision, conforming to the Zoning Bylaws,
Planning Board regulations, and Board of Health regulations, of the Town of Seekonk,
should be submitted by the subdivider for discussion and tentative approval by the Board.
In the case of a nonresidential subdivision, any person before submitting his definitive plan
for approval shall submit to the Planning Board and the Board of Health, a Preliminary Plan,
and shall give notice to the Town Clerk by delivery or by registered mail, postage prepaid,
that he has submitted such plan.
The submission of such a Preliminary Plan will enable the subdivider, the Board, other
municipal agencies and owners of Properties abutting the subdivision to discuss and clarify
such subdivisions before a Definitive Plan is prepared.
When a Preliminary Plan is submitted, the applicant shall file by delivery or registered mail
an application (Form B) with the Town Clerk stating the date of submission for such approval
of a Preliminary Plan.
4.2 Contents - The Preliminary Plan shall be drawn at the required scale and eight (8) prints shall
be filed at the office of the Planning Board and one (1) print at the office of the Board of
Health. Said plan shall be identified as a Preliminary Plan and show all the information
required under the definition of the Preliminary Plan so as to form a clear basis for discussion
of its problems and for preparation of the Definitive Plan. In addition to those items included
in the definition of a Preliminary Plan, the following shall be submitted:
1. Two (2) completed copies of application Form B.
2. A locus plan of the subdivision, showing its relation to the surrounding area, at a scale of
1 inch = 400 feet.
3. A layout drawing of the subdivision at 1" = 40' or such other scale as the Board may
accept to show adequate detail. Said layout drawing shall include proposed roadways,
lots, open space, drainage areas and connections to existing roadways for the
development. All proposed street names shall conform to the provisions of Section II
Definitions Streets and Ways. Per the roadway design standards of Section 7 of these
regulations all proposed streets shall be designed so that they connect to each other and to
other surrounding streets so as to promote circulation between streets. The construction of
"Cul-de-Sacs" and dead end streets is to be avoided and are not the preferred method of
construction of the Planning Board.
4. In the case of a subdivision covering less than all of the land owned by the subdivider in
the area of the subdivision, the locus plan shall show in a general manner the proposed
over-all development of all said land.
8
5. Percolation, maximum groundwater elevation and soil profile tests as required in 4.3 and
4.4, including the location of test holes.

forth in Attachment B of the Seekonk General By-laws
4.3. Percolat ion tests - The Planning Board or Board of Health may require percolation tests be
taken on some or all the lots within the proposed subdivision. Two copies of a report showing
the location and results of the tests shall be submitted with the plans. Tests shall be made in
accordance with current Town of Seekonk regulations governing percolation tests and septic
system installation and be performed by or under the supervision of a Professional Engineer
or Registered Sanitarian. If percolation tests are required, the developer shall notify the Board
of Health in accordance with its rules and regulations.
4.4. Groundwater and Soil Profile - Maximum groundwater-table elevation and soil profile
procedure shall be in accordance with Board of Health regulations. All elevations shall be
determined with reference to true mean sea level.
4.4.1. Soil profile must be illustrated per Appendix VI for all test holes as dug.
4.4.2. The lowest floor elevation of the proposed building(s) shall be at least two (2) feet
above the maximum groundwater elevation.
4.4.3. If the groundwater elevation is higher than acceptable, the developer's engineer may
submit with his preliminary plan a proposed under drain system that will lower the
maximum water table elevation to an acceptable level as defined in 4.4.2. The Board
will evaluate the proposed sub-drainage system in terms of its expected useful life,
maintenance requirements, and the effect that lowering of the groundwater table on
the site will have on adjacent lots.
4.4.4. The groundwater table determinations shall be made at a sufficient number of places
to truly reflect the elevation of the water table. Except where the Board of Health
requirements are more stringent, a minimum of two determinations shall be made. A
minimum of one determination per three acres shall be made on tracts larger than five
acres.
4.4.5. Unless the Board of Health requires otherwise, the developer shall notify the Board of
Health at least forty-eight hours prior to when the groundwater tests are to be made
and shall also provide safe and convenient access to the test sites.

encountered or the bottom elevation of a dry hole and the results of soil profile
analysis will be indicated on the report submitted.
9
4.4.7. In order to observe fluctuations of the water table, a representative number of test
holes as required by the Board of Health and/or Planning Board shall remain open
until construction of the subdivision is completed by means of the following:
Perforated standpipes with a nominal diameter of four (4) inches shall be inserted in
the designated holes, and they shall be capped and marked for protection and ease of
location.
4.4.8. Location of all groundwater level tests will be shown on the topographical plan.
These test locations must be located by at least two (2) coordinate from fixed
reference points.
4.5. During discussion of the Preliminary Plan the complete information required for the
Definitive Plan (5 .3 - Contents) and the financial arrangement (Section VI - Performance
Guarantees) will be developed. Also, at this time a determination will be made as to whether
an evaluation of the potential for erosion and sedimentation (5.4), runoff (5.5), and/or the
scope and focus of any Environmental Impact Statement that may be required as set forth in
Section 5.6 herein will be necessary. Statements of the above discussions and determinations
shall be included in any motion to approve or decision otherwise rendered by the Planning
Board on the Preliminary Plans.
4.6. Within forty-five ( 45) days after submission of a Preliminary Plan the Planning Board and the
Board of Health shall approve such Preliminary Plan with or without modifications, or the
Planning Board and the Board of Health shall disapprove such Preliminary Plan, and, in the
case of disapproval, shall state the reasons therefor. The forty-five day period shall be
adhered to unless an extension is agreed upon by the Planning Board and the Applicant. The
Planning Board may not approve a Preliminary Plan except in compliance with
recommendations by the Board of Health.
4. 7. Approval of a Preliminary Plan does not constitute approval of a subdivision, and a
Preliminary Plan shall not be recorded in the Registry of Deeds.
4.8. If a Definitive Plan is duly submitted with seven (7) months from the date of submission of
the Preliminary Plan which was not disapproved, the subdivision Rules and Regulations in
effect at the time of submission of the Preliminary Plan shall govern the Definitive Plan.
4.9. In accordance with Chapter 40A, Section 6, of the General Laws, land shown on the
Preliminary Plan shall be governed by the zoning requirements in effect at the time of its first
submission while the plan is being processed under the subdivision control law provided that
the Definitive Plan of the subdivision is finally approved. Upon approval of the Definitive
Plan, the zoning provisions in effect at the time of the first submission of the Preliminary Plan
shall be applicable for eight years from the date of endorsement of such approval. In the case
where a subdivision plan was submitted or submitted and approved before January 1, 1976,
the zoning requirement in effect at the time of submission of the plan shall be applicable for
seven years from the date of endorsement of approval of the subdivision.

5.1 General
SECTIONV
DEFINITIVE PLAN
Any person who submits a Definitive Plan of a subdivision to the Planning Board for approval
shall file with the Board all contents contained within the checklist for a Form C. The applicant
shall be responsible for mailing costs. Notices mailed to abutters shall be in the form of certified
mail return receipt requested and shall be in the form of the published advertisement.
When reviewing an application for approval, the Board may determine that the assistance of
outside consultants is warranted due to the size, scale or complexity of a proposed project or
because of a project's potential impacts. The Board may require that applicants pay a "review
fee" consisting of the reasonable costs incurred by the Board for the employment of outside
consultants engaged by the Board to assist in the review of an application.
In hiring outside consultants, the Board may engage engineers, planners, lawyers, urban
designers or other appropriate professionals who can assist the Board in analyzing a project to
ensure compliance with all relevant laws, By-laws, and regulations.
The Board may have several consultants used on a rotating basis, who are responsible for
providing a quote for said review. The applicant shall provide funds equal to said quote so the
review can begin. Funds received by the Board pursuant to this section shall be deposited with
the municipal treasurer who shall establish a special account for this purpose. Expenditures from
this special account may be made at the direction of the Board without further appropriation.
Expenditures from this special account shall be made only in connection with the review of a
specific project or projects for which a review fee has been or will be collected from the
applicant. Failure of an applicant to pay a review fee shall be grounds for denial of the
application.
Any applicant may take an administrative appeal from the selection of the outside consultant to
the Board of Selectmen. The grounds for such an appeal shall be limited to claims that the
consultant selected has a conflict of interest or does not possess the minimum, required
qualifications. The minimum qualifications shall consist either of an educational degree in, or
related to, the field at issue or three or more years or practice in the field at issue or a related
field. The required time limit for action upon an application by the Board shall be extended by
the duration of the administrative appeal. In the event that no decision is made by the Board of
Selectmen within one month following the filing of the appeal, the selection made by the Board
shall stand.

The developer shall be required to submit an environmental impact statement for proposed
definitive subdivisions resulting in 4 or more lots for development. The purpose of this
statement is intended to alert the developer to the possible adverse effects the subdivision may
create on the environmental resources at the development site. The second purpose is to provide
town officials with sufficient information on the impact the development will have on town
services and resources in order that the town can plan to meet those needs. Per Section 4.5 the
focus and scope of the Environmental Impact Statement shall be determined by the Planning
Board at the Preliminary Plan stage. Where no preliminary plan has been filed the applicant
shall be responsible for submitting an environmental statement in full conformance with the
provisions and requirements of this section unless otherwise specifically waived by the Planning
Board. In reviewing the statement, it is the intent of the Planning Board to use the information
concerning the impact of the development on town resources for purposes of accepting or
rejecting the Definitive Plan.
The Planning Board may waive the requirement for the submission of any section or sections of
the statement which it seems inappropriate to the proposed development. IT IS THE
INTENTION OF THE PLANNING BOARD TO GRANT WAIVERS AS A MATTER OF
COURSE WHERE EXCESS IMPACTS ARE NOT ANTICIPATED. It is suggested, however,
that the developer discuss the requirements with the Board prior to submission of a preliminary
plan. The statement should be to the greatest extent possible a technical rather than a subjective
document. References and calculations shall be submitted with the plan and the statement itself
shall include the following elements unless waived by the Board.

erodibility and the suitability of the soils for different uses. Provide inf01mation
on the suitability of soils for flooding infiltration at such location(s) as the
Planning Board, Board of Health, or Conservation Commission may require. The
Planning Board may utilize the service(s) of the Soil Conservation Service to the
Town Engineer to determine same, and may apply all or some of the costs of such
services to the applicant.
5.6.2.2 Sub-surface Conditions
1. Indicate the range of the depth to bedrock and the location of bedrock

4. Evaluate the possible impact of sewage disposal methods on the quality of
subsurface water. A determination of nutrient loading shall be required if a
portion or all of the proposed development lies within the watershed or
zone of contribution of a public water supply well(s), either existing or
proposed. It shall be the responsibility of the Planning Board with written
recommendations from the Water District, to determine whether the plan
for subdivision falls, partially or totally, within the existing or proposed
public water supply well' s watershed or zone of contribution.
a. Determination of nutrient loading shall be done using available loading
estimates from the local Board of Health, State or Federal performance
standards (whichever is the more restrictive) and shall include, at a
minimum:
L The existing condition of the water body or water supply, including
physical characteristics;
11. The expected change in the condition of the water body or water
supply as a result of the proposed development;
111. The comparison, on a per acre basis, of the total nutrient loading
from the proposed development with:
aa. The loading rate which would be expected or
produce critical eutrophic levels in a water body, or
in the case of water supply, the loading rate which
16
would produce nitrate-nitrogen levels in excess of
five (5) parts per million, and/or:
bb. The loading rate of those contaminants which the
Planning Board and the Board of Health may
necessarily require but which are only proved by the
State of Massachusetts Listing of Primary Maximum
Allowable Contaminant Levels in Water.
1v. The proposal of measure to mitigate and reduce the nutrient loading
if (3) above indicates that the per acre loading rate from the
proposed development equals or exceeds the critical loading rate
when combined with existing and potential development within the
recharge area defined in 5.6.2.2.4 above. For these purposes, the
following standards shall apply, unless the petitioner demonstrates
to the Planning Board, with concurrence from the Board of Health,
that other standards are appropriate for this project.
aa. Loading per person:
• 5 lbs. nitrogen/person/year;
• .25 lbs. phosphorus/person/year for those sewage disposal
systems within 200 feet of any water body at the highest
water mark;
• three persons per dwelling unit, and one dwelling unit per
each 40,000 square feet of buildable lot area, unless and
until public sewer is made available to each lot and
connected.
bb. Loading from lawn fertilizers:
• 3 lbs. nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of lawn/year.
cc. Loading from street runoff:
• .19 lbs. nitrogen per lineal mile/one way/per day.

recordation in the Land Court or the Registry of Deeds.
5.9.3 Final approval of the Definitive Plan does not constitute the laying out or acceptance by
the town of streets within a subdivision. (Refer to Section 6.8.1, Street/Land - Initiation
of Acceptance.)
5.9.4 If a Definitive Plan is disapproved and the developer resubmits a revised Definitive Plan
within two (2) months of the date of disapproval, the Planning Board may not require a
new public hearing. A new public hearing shall be required if a revised Definitive Plan is
submitted more than two (2) months have passed since the date of disapproval.
5.10 Time Extension
If the need for additional time is indicated to resolve an application, the applicant may agree in
writing to an extension oftime to a given date.

6.1 General
SECTION VI
PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
Upon Planning Board vote to approve a Definitive Plan but before the plan can be endorsed by
the Planning Board and recorded, the applicant shall guarantee the construction of the
subdivision in compliance with the approved plan and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such approval, by a bond or other security or with a covenant.
6.2 Bond or Security
The developer shall file a security in the amount deemed by the Planning Board to be sufficient
to cover the estimated cost of all required work at the expiration of the time period specified by
the applicant for the performance of said work. Said cost estimate shall include an estimate of
the prevailing wage cost of labor to the Town should it undertake completion of the approved
public improvements. The Planning Board's reviewing engineer shall review and confirm the
appropriateness of the estimated prevailing wage cost adjustment included in the estimate. If at
the elapse of the time period specified by the developer, the security shall be in automatic
default. This period may be extended by vote of the Board of a specified time upon a written
request of the developer, concurred in by surety, if any, and in writing.
Despite the aforementioned security, the Board does not warrant that roads with ancillary utilities
and appurtenances depicted on the approved Definitive Plan will actually be constructed or that
any of the lots shown will be usable as buildable lots.
The applicant may select from the following methods of security, and may from time to time
vary the method or combination of methods:
1. Proper bond, sufficient in the opinion of the Planning Board to secure performance of the
construction of ways and the installation of municipal services required for lots in the
subdivision;
2. Deposit of money, or negotiable securities, such as certified check, savings certificates
assigned to the Town and acceptable to the Town. All instruments shall comply with the
requirements ofG.L. c. 41, §81U.;
3. Covenant, executed and duly recorded, running with the land, whereby ways and services
shall be provided to serve any lot before such lot may be built upon or conveyed, other than
by mortgaged deed;
4. Agreement executed after the recording of a first mortgage covering the premises shown on
the plan or a portion thereof given as security for advances to be made to the applicant and
the lender and shall provide for the retention by the lender of funds sufficient to secure the
construction.
22
The Board shall not accept a covenant not to build on an individual lot as surety to guarantee the
installation of infrastructure that is required to serve other lots.
The Board shall not accept a letter of credit as surety, since a letter of credit is not negotiable
security as required under G.L. c.41, §81U, i/7(2).
6.3 Agreement
Whenever the bond does not clearly state the conditions, scope and time of performance secured
thereby, a separate surety agreement shall be executed by the Planning Board on behalf of the
Town, the developer and the surety company, if any, referring to the conditions under which the
security referred to herein may be realized upon or the bond enforced. Such agreement, or a
separate certificate given by the Board, shall enumerate the lots which may be built upon or sold
and shall be in a form suitable for recording.
6.4 Extension of Time
When the time period for the performance of the required work is extended, such extension shall
be subject to the conditions of the original bond or agreement, but the amount of security or the
penal sum of the bond may be increased by the Planning Board to cover the estimated cost at the
end of the extension period. Such continuation of conditions and any increase in the penal sum
of the bond or the amount of security shall be accepted in writing as a condition of such
extension by the developer and the surety company, if any.
6.5 Reduction of Security
Upon partial performance by the developer of the required work the Board shall, upon written
request of the developer, reduce the penal sum of the bond or deposit held, to a sum bearing a
direct and reasonable relationship to the expected cost including the effects of inflation,
necessary to complete the work remaining. Such sum shall include an estimate of the prevailing
wage cost of labor to the Town should it undertake completion of the approved public
improvements. The Planning Board's reviewing engineer shall review and confirm the
appropriateness of the estimated prevailing wage cost adjustment included in the estimate. Such
reduction shall not affect the obligations of the developer and the surety with respect to the
required work and the maintenance of streets and utilities until all such work is completed and
the surety released, except as may be expressly voted by the Board.
6.6 Failure of Performance
Upon failure of the developer to satisfactorily complete all required work secured by a bond or
other security within the time specified and in accordance with these Rules and Regulations, the
Planning Board shall have the right to enforce the bond or realize upon the security to the extent
of the reasonable cost to the Town of completing the required construction and installation
23
including any portion of such security necessary to cover the expenses incurred in conjunction
therewith and return any amounts left after such completion to the developer.
6.7 Covenant
Instead of securing performance by a bond or other security, the applicant may elect to give the
Board a covenant duly executed by the owner of record and consented to by other paiiies with
property interests in the land, such as any mortgagee or tenant in common. Such covenant shall
run with the land and shall provide that no lot secured by such covenant in the subdivision or any
portion thereof shall be built upon or sold, other than by a mortgage deed, until the ways and the
utilities or other required improvements to serve such lots have been constructed or installed to
the satisfaction of the Planning Board, and the Board shall have voted to release such lots from
the operation of said covenant. The covenant shall identify the lots restricted by its operation and
the scope and, if appropriate, the geographic limits of construction and installation required for
the release of such lots and may specify the time within which such construction and installation
is to be completed. The Planning Board shall have the right to extend such time and continue the
operation of the covenant at the developer's request, but the failure of the developer to complete
the required work within the time specified or within the time so extended by the Board shall be
a reason for the rescission of the approval of the subdivision, and any portion thereof subject to
such covenant, in addition to other remedies provided by law. (See Form GG for a standard
covenant agreement.)
When the Developer requests the early release of a covenant, before the total completion of the
subdivision, the Board may, at its discretion, release the covenant upon receipt by the Board a
satisfactory performance security as specified under Chap 41 M.G.L. Sect. 81 U sufficient, in the
opinion of the Planning Board's consulting engineer, to cover the cost of completing the
subdivision, including the prevailing wage cost of the project should the Town undertake the
completion of the improvements, per the approved plans and conditions and to cover the cost of
possible repairs, for the following two (2) years, or until the roads are accepted at the Town
Meeting, whichever is earlier.
6.8 Release of Performance Guarantee
Upon the satisfactory completion of all required work, including the delivery of "as built" plans
and certifications, the developer shall send a statement by registered mail to the Town Clerk and
the Planning Board that the required construction and installation has been completed in
accordance with these Rules and Regulations, enumerating the lots covered by the performance
guarantee for such construction and installation and requesting the release of bond or other
security or the release of lots from the operation of the covenant. Within forty-five days of such
request, the Board shall either vote to release and return such bond or security, or vote to release
the lots affected from the operation of the covenant, terminating the developer's obligations in
connection therewith, or else the Board shall advise the developer by registered mail and the
Town Clerk of the specific details of non-performance or failure to comply with these Rules and
Regulations. If the Board fails to so notify the developer and the Town Clerk within said fortyfive
days, the Town Clerk shall issue a certificate that the covenant is void, with respect to any
24
lots, the release of which has been requested, or that all obligations under the bond or other
security are terminated and it may be returned to the developer. Such certificate shall be in a
form suitable for recording.
6.8.1 Street/Land - Initiatjon of Acceptance
Once the top course has been applied, the Planning Board shall retain a minimum of
fifteen (15%) percent of the security amount. Upon seventy-five (75%) percent build out
of the subdivision and any final corrective measures to the top course are completed by
the applicant (see Section 8.5.5.2), the Planning Board shall retain a minimum of five
(5%) percent of the security amount. At that time, the applicant may submit in writing to
the Board of Selectmen, a formal request for Town acceptance of the bonded or otherwise
secured streets or land to be dedicated. Once the Town accepts said streets or lands, the
Planning Board shall release the resultant security amount. Approval of the definitive
plan or release of security does not constitute the laying out or acceptance by the Town of
streets within the subdivision.
6.8.2 Drainage System
Performance guarantees related to the drainage system shall not be released until one year
following the approval of said drainage system by the Board or the Board's agents. Upon
acceptance of the roadway as a public street, or as otherwise provided in the associated
legal documents; maintenance of the drainage system shall be the responsibility of a
homeowners association established for that purpose. All documents and easements
related to the drainage system shall be recorded in the registry of deeds prior to the sale of
the first lot in the development. The recorded documents shall include the provision of a
deeded right to the Town of Seekonk to enter and make such repairs to the drainage
system as necessary, in the event that a homeowners association fails to do so, and after
appropriate notice to the association and opportunity to cure, and to seek reimbursement
of any cost incurred from said association or the members thereof as appropriate under
the law. A copy of the operations and maintenance plan and all pertinent easements and
grants shall be provided to each homeowner no later than the final closing for each lot.
Final transfer of the operation and maintenance of the drainage system from the
developer to the homeowner' s association shall be in accordance with the documents
recorded in association with the establishment thereof.
6.9 Election of Perfo1111ai1ce Guarantee
As between a bond or other security and a covenant, the developer shall have the right to elect
which performance guarantee type to use and the right to change from one type to the other from
time to time, but the Planning Board shall have the right to specify the time of performance.
Subject to the Town Treasurer's approval of the form and manner of execution, the Planning
Board shall have the right to specify the penal sum of any bond or the type and amount of other
negotiable security. The Board may, at its option and subject to the Town Treasurers approval,
25
accept as security any readily negotiable property of sufficient value, such as may comply to the
requirements of Chapter 41 M.G.L. §81U. The Board may further in lieu of a bond or a deposit
enter into an agreement with the holder of the first mortgage on the subdivision, which
agreement shall provide for the retention of sufficient funds, otherwise due to the applicant, in
the event of failure of timely performance of the required construction and installation and shall
further provide that such undisbursed funds shall be available for the completion of the required
work in the event of the developer's failure to perform such work
The developer shall submit to the Planning Board a new plan of that part of the subdivision to be
subject to the operation of the covenant. The board shall inscribe on such new plan a reference
to the restriction of the covenant, and the plan shall be recorded, superseding the previously
recorded plan which had no reference to the covenant. Copies of all covenants, agreements,
releases and other actions by the Board shall be furnished to the Inspector of Buildings, who
shall issue no building permit for any lot in a subdivision unless first satisfied that such a lot has
been released for building and sale and is not restricted by the operation of a covenant.
6.10 When setting bond requirements or executing covenants, it shall be the policy of the Planning
Board to consider the feasibility of developing the subdivision in a phased manner. If because of
the number of planned lots the Board deems that the development could be done in phases, the
Board shall consider this option in the setting, reduction and timing of bond requirements and/or
the drawing up of covenants to cover the construction of ways, utilities and other required
improvements.
6.11 A filing fee in accordance with the currently adopted fee schedule set forth in Attachment B of
the Seekonk General By-laws, made payable to the Town of Seekonk, shall be submitted with
every request for reduction of surety, partial release of covenant and final release of performance
guarantee. For establishing or releasing covenants, the applicant shall record the covenant.

SECTION VII
DESIGN STANDARDS
All subdivisions shall be designed and laid out so that in the opinion of the Board they meet the
requirements of public safety including safe vehicular travel, adequate storm drainage, sewage
disposal and water supply, utilities, as well as precautions against possible natural disasters. All
streets in the subdivision shall be designed to provide for safe vehicular travel, livability and
amenity of the subdivision. Dead-end streets and developments containing multiple cul-de-sacs
shall be avoided. Subdivision design shall conform to the rules and accepted principles of
correct land use, sound planning, and good engineering.
7.2 Streets
7.2.1 Location and Horizontal Alignment
7 .2.1.1 All streets shall conform to topography, and where possible straight segments of
over 300 feet which encourage speeding shall be avoided in minor streets.
Collector and arterial streets shall facilitate safe movements of traffic by
providing ample sight distances and by avoiding steep horizontal and vertical
curves particularly at approaches to intersections.
7.2.1.2 Proposed streets shall conform as far as practical to master or study plans, if any,
as adopted in whole or part by the Planning Board.
7 .2.1.3 The Board may require a definitive subdivision plan to layout its ways so as to
provide adequately for possible future connections to new ways and to allow for
access to adjoining land, in order to promote through connections and eliminate
dead-ends. Multiple cul-de-sacs within a subdivision is not acceptable. Streets
shall be designed so that they connect with other streets and avoid the creation of
cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs are intended to provide temporary dead-ends and shall
be design and laid out to allow for future connections to either existing roadways
or adjoining property. Cul-de-sacs shall not be utilized for the sole purpose of
creating frontage to allow for additional lots for development.
7 .2.1.4 Reserve strips prohibiting access to streets or adjoining property shall not
ordinarily be permitted.
7.2.1.5 The minimum centerline radii of curved streets shall be not less than the
following:
Arterial Streets .......... 800 feet
Collector Streets ........ 600 feet
Minor Street. ........... 150 feet
27
7.2.1.6 Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. No
street shall intersect any other street at less than sixty (60) degrees, although in
some cases the Planning Board may accept a lesser angle in the direction of travel.
7 .2.1. 7 Street intersection jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five
(125) feet shall be avoided.
7.2.1.8 Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded or cut back to provide for a
curb radius of not less than twenty (20) feet at intersections of minor streets with
other minor streets, and twenty-five (25) feet or greater at all other intersections.
Said radii shall not extend onto, or into the public right of way directly in front of,
abutting properties not part of the proposed subdivision.
7.2.1.9 A concerted effort shall be made to provide at least 500' of visibility in both
directions on high-speed roads (i.e., 35 mph+) and at least 500' of visibility on
lower speed roads for the establishment of bus stops when designing street
intersections. New street within these distances from other streets, whether
preexisting or new, will meet this standard for visibility from any intersection.
7.2.2 Width
7.2.2.1. The minimum width of street rights-of-way shall be not less than the following:
Arterial Streets ........................... 96 feet
Non-Residential Collector Streets ..... 62 feet

The minimum width of pavement for driveway entrances within the rights-of-way
to industrial lots shall be thirty (30) feet flaring to forty ( 40) feet at the curb line.
The minimum width of pavement for driveway entrances within the rights-of-way
to residential lots shall be twelve (12) feet flaring to sixteen (16) feet at the curb
line. Driveways shall not exceed 24' in width.
The minimum width of pavement for sidewalks, where required, shall be four ( 4)
feet.
In all instances the design of streets and the location and construction of
pavement, sidewalks, grass strips, curbs and utilities shall conform to the
applicable cross-section (see Appendix I).
When necessary due to anticipated traffic load, the width of the right-of-way and
pavement shall be increased in six ( 6) foot increments.
7.2.3.1 Grades of streets shall be not less than 1 % nor greater than 8% for minor streets, not less
than 0.6% nor greater than 9% for collector streets, and not less than 0.6% nor greater
than 6% for arterial streets unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board.
7.2.3.2 On any street where the grade exceeds six (6%) percent on the approach to an
intersection, a leveling area with a slope of less than one (1 %) percent shall be provided
for a distance of not less than fifty (50) feet measured from the nearest exterior line of the
intersecting street. Where a subdivision roadway meets an existing public way, the
entrance shall be graded so that runoff from the existing public way does not enter the
subdivision drainage system.
7.2.3.3 Vertical curves are required whenever the algebraic difference in grade between
centerline tangents is 0.5% or more. For minor and collector streets the minimum length
of vertical curve shall be twenty-five (25') feet per 1 % change of grade. Vertical curves
29
for arterial streets shall be in accordance with the most current design standards outlined
by AASHTO in A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.
7.2.3.4 All roadway pavements on minor or collector streets shall have a cross slope from the
centerline of the roadway of no less than W' inch per foot. Horizontal curves on collector
streets may be superelevated in accordance with the most current design standards
outlined by AASHTO in A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. When
a roadway changes directions on a hill, the pavement shall be sloped so that water will
not drain from one side of the road to the other. Minor Streets shall not be superelevated.
7.2.3.5 All side slopes resulting from grading of streets and sidewalks shall not exceed one (1)
foot vertical to three (3) feet horizontal in fill, one (1) foot to two (2) feet in cut, or one
(1) foot to three quarters (3/4) foot in ledge. Retaining walls shall be employed where
slopes cannot be contained within these limits.
7 .2.3.6 On arterial streets, whenever the approved street grade and the grade of the adjacent land
is such that side slopes of one (I) foot vertical to five (5) feet horizontal or steeper are
created and/or if hazardous roadside features or appurtenances are present and cannot be
removed or redesigned, the developer shall be required to install a protective guardrail.
For collector and minor streets, the Planning Board may require guard rails where side
slopes of one (1) foot vertical to three (3) feet horizontal or steeper are present and/or
where hazardous roadside features or appurtenances are present and cannot be removed
or redesigned.
7.2.4 Dead-end Streets
7 .2.4.1 The length of permanent dead-end streets shall not exceed the frontage that would allow
for a maximum number of six (6) lots having the minimum frontage permitted under
zoning along each side of the street. This length can be exceeded if a permanent deadend
street traverses past lots that are not part of a proposed subdivision or serviced by
said street. Where in the opinion of the Board safety and convenience will not be
sacrificed or whenever the total length of a dead-end street exceeds one thousand (1,000)
feet, or in non-residential subdivisions, the Board may require a special double roadway
or parkway street.
7.2.4.2 Dead-end streets shall be provided at the closed end with a turnabout having a diameter
of one hundred and five (105) feet and a property line diameter of at least one hundred
twenty-five (125) feet, and with a forty (40) foot diameter landscaped island at the center
point (see Appendix IV). Alternative designs may be permitted by the Planning board
with the written recommendation of the Public Works Department and /or Fire
Department. Such alternatives shall provide for sufficient area so that a vehicle with a
turning radius of fifty (50) feet can execute a turnaround in one operation.
7.2.4.3 If a dead-end street is of a temporary nature, a temporary turnaround shall be provided if
the street is greater than one hundred fifty (150) feet in length from the nearest
intersection. Temporary turnaround easements shall be provided and they shall conform
30
to the dimension requirements of permanent turnarounds. Temporary turnarounds must
meet specifications of permanent turnarounds, including bonding.
7.2.4.4 For the purposes of this section, any proposed street which intersects solely with a deadend
street shall be deemed to be an extension of the existing dead-end street.
7.3 Sidewalks
Sidewalks shall be designed in conformance with the currently applicable standards of the
United States Access Board Public Ways Guidelines.
7.4 Easements
7.4.1 Easements for utilities and drainage facilities across lots, centered on rear or side lot
lines, shall be provided where necessary, at least thirty (30) feet wide in all nonConservation
Subdivisions and at least twenty (20) feet wide in all Conservation
Subdivisions, and located on land owned by the homeowner's association established for
the proposed subdivision. Such easements will be submitted with and be part of the
Definitive Plan and recorded as a separate document with the Registry of Deeds.
7.4.2 Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel or stream, the
Board shall require that there be provided a storm drainage easement of a minimum width
of twenty (20) feet to conform substantially to the lines of such water course, drainage
way, channel or stream, and to provide for construction or other necessary purposes.
7.4.3 Access easements to park and conservation land shall be secured for the benefit of the
Town and shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide. Signage shall be erected by the
applicant indicating such easements at appropriate locations, as determined by the
Planning Board, prior to building permits being issued within the proposed subdivision.
7.4.4 An easement of at least twenty (20) feet wide shall be provided at the end of all dead end
streets to the depth of the lots for future main tie-ins, except if no developable land exists
on the adjacent property, as determined by the Planning Board.

adequate supply of water to each of the lots in the subdivision and for purposes of fire
protection.
7.5.2 Where feasible, water mains shall connect to the existing municipal system and extension
to adjacent undeveloped land shall be required to be drawn on the Definitive Plan.
Wherever possible, water mains shall be laid out to form a continuous loop with the
existing or proposed system to avoid dead-ended pipes.
31
7.5.3 The mm1mum water mam diameter shall be m accordance with Water District
requirements.
7.5.4 Where development occurs outside the water service area of the Seekonk Water District
or other public water supply the Planning Board shall require compliance with the
applicable provisions of sub-section 8.3 Fire Protection of these regulations.
7.6 Storm Drainage Systems
The design of storm sewers, culverts, storage ponds and other drainage facilities shall be based
on the calculations and requirements developed as per Section 5 .5 of these rules and regulations
or, if the Planning Board waives that section, shall be based upon the "rational method" or "SoilCover-
Complex Method" as follows: 100 year design storm for culverts, bridges and
storage/retention facilities, and 25 year design storm for storm sewers, catchbasins, manholes and
other related drainage facilities.
7.7 Open Spaces
7.7.l Before approval of a Definitive Plan the Board may require the plan to show a park or
parks suitably located for playground or recreation purposes or providing light and air. In
calculating the amount of land that shall be set aside as park land or open space, the
following rates shall be applied: in R-1 or R-2 districts - .06 acre per dwelling unit; in R-
3 or R-4 districts - .1 acre per dwelling unit. In no case shall the amount ofland be more
that ten (10) percent of the total area of the subdivision. The Planning Board may by
appropriate endorsements on the plan require that no building be erected upon such land
for a period of up to three (3) years without its approval. Within this time period the
Town may if it desires purchase said land.
7. 7 .2 If the Board requires the developer to set aside land for parks or open space, it shall
determine that such land is suitable for the intended purpose with respect to soils,
topography, drainage or other characteristics which could restrict the use of the site. The
Board may also require, where appropriate, that any land designated for open space be
continuous with parks or open areas on adjacent sites, and have access provided which is
acceptable to the Planning Board.
7.7.3 The provision, design, and location of open space and park areas shall reflect and protect
any major site features, and any threatened or critical resources identified on site in the
Environmental Impact Statement for a subdivision or through the course of the Planning
Board review of an application.
32
7.8 Protection of Natural Features
In order to enhance and maintain property values and to protect existing natural characteristics
within the subdivision, major site features as identified in the contents of the Definitive Plan and
required in Section 5.3 .19 Major site features, above, and any threatened or critical natural
resource as may be identified in the environmental impact statement for the development or
during the course of the Planning Board's consideration of an application, shall be preserved to
the maximum possible extent, and not be removed or damaged except with the express approval
of the Planning Board and/or the Conservation Commission. If it shall be the natural order of
things to remove or damage said features in order to provide for the elements of the subdivision,
the applicant shall take every means possible to replace and restore the land to its original
definition based on reasonable Planning Board and/or Conservation Commission stipulations.
Where feasible, the layout of lots and the location of buildings shall be accomplished with due
regard driven to preserving the major site features so identified and located in the Definitive
Plan.

subdivision approval or in coordination with other Town Departments may
also be placed on the certificate.
8.5.5.2 The top course shall not be applied until at least one year following the
application of the binder course. The applicant must maintain all aspects of
the subdivision until the road has been accepted by the Town. Once the
Building Inspector issues certificates of occupancy for seventy-five (75%)
percent of the lots shown on a Definitive Plan, the top course of asphalt will
then be inspected by the Planning Board or its agent. Any deficiencies
found must be corrected to the satisfaction of the Planning Board before an
applicant can request acceptance of the road.
8.5.6 Grades and Stakes - the subdivider will provide an original survey showing the base line
