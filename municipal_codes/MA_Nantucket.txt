§ 26-18. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, the following definitions shall apply:
CONTRACTOR — Any firm or corporation in the business of supplying and
installing alarm systems or servicing the same.[Amended 4-15-2003 ATM
by Art. 26, approved 8-27-2003]
FALSE PRIVATE FIRE ALARM — Any signal, telephone dialer or oral
communication from an alarm company's central station transmitted
directly to the Fire Department requesting, requiring or resulting in a
response on the part of the Fire Department as a result of the activation
of an alarm system by any cause where in fact a hazard requiring urgent
attention to which fire fighters are expected to respond does not exist.
Such causes include mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation
or recklessness, intentional conduct or negligence of the user of an alarm
system or of his employees or agents. For purpose of this definition,
activation of an alarm system by any of the following acts, including but not
limited to vandals, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and similar weather
or atmospheric disturbances, shall not be deemed a false alarm.
FIRE ALARM SYSTEM — Any assembly of equipment or any device
designed to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent attention to
which fire fighters are expected to respond, excluding any private alarm
system regulated by any bylaw applicable to the Police Department
response to private intruder alarms. 6
TOWN — The Town of Nantucket.
USER — The occupant of the premises containing the alarm system.
It has been determined that the number of false private alarms being
made to the Fire Department hinders the efficiency of that Department
by the deployment of apparatus and personnel to so-called "false
alarms."
A.
The adoption of this article is intended to charge the user whose
property continually generates false private alarms due to improperly
designed, installed or maintained systems.
B.
It is further intended to reduce the number of false alarms by
promoting responsible users and reliable systems for the protection of
life and property. A reduction in false alarms will, in turn, save the
taxpayers dollars for the Town of Nantucket.

are authorized to respond to an emergency signal transmitted by an
alarm system and who are authorized to open the premises wherein the
alarm system is installed.
A.
Receipt of the information described in Subsection A above shall not
in any way limit the right of the Fire Department to enter the subject
premises prior to the arrival of the authorized person or company
should immediate entry be deemed necessary by the Fire Department.
B.
All alarm systems installed after the effective date of this article shall
be equipped with a battery backup or other device or be of a design so

telephone numbers, as well as the name, address and telephone
number of at least two other persons or companies who are authorized
to respond to a signal transmitted by the alarm system and who are
authorized to open the premises on which the alarm system is installed.
Such registration may require permission from the user in favor of
the Town of Nantucket to break into and enter the premises forcibly
without liability to the Town or to any fire fighter and may require
indemnification by the user in favor of the Town and such fire fighters
for any damage resulting from such entry in response to such private
fire alarm.
A.
For alarm systems currently installed, such persons shall submit such
registration statements within 30 days of the adoption of this article.

within a calendar year, the Fire Chief, or his designee, may, at his
discretion, in writing, notify the private alarm user:
That the use of the private fire alarm system is to be discontinued
insofar as a response is expected from the Nantucket Fire
Department until the repairs are made acceptable to the Fire
Department; and
(1)
That further connection to the communications console at the fire

system with a battery backup or other device or that the alarm
system be of a design so as to prevent the signalling of alarms in
the event of an AC power failure.
(2)
A.
The alarm user shall be assessed a fee of $200 for each additional false

alarm transmitted from that property (notwithstanding the provisions
of Subsection A above) until the required inspection has been
completed by a recognized testing company.
D.
Any person disconnecting a system or portion of a system for the
purpose of circumventing this article shall be fined $300 and, in the

B.
Notice to include instructions. Each notice of a false alarm fee or the

satisfactory to the Personnel Board, the Board shall allocate such new/
changed position(s) to the appropriate class.
D.

determined such reclassification to be consistent with the classification
plan. The Board may, however, when it considers such action to be
necessary for the proper functioning of Town services, authorize a new
classification and assign the same to an existing compensation level or
determine the rate to be paid to an incumbent employee. Such action
on the part of the Board shall, however, be subject to ratification by the
next Annual Town Meeting.

the landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to impair
the utility of the Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it
is necessary in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare that
the creation, establishment or maintenance of airport hazards be prevented
by exercise of police power, without compensation to any person, except as
herein specifically provided.

The Airport Commission is hereby designated as the administrative agency
charged with the duty of administering and enforcing this chapter.

nor altered nor any tree permitted to grow or be maintained to a height
§ 46-4 AIRPORT APPROACH ZONE § 53-4

and parallel to the end of the runway within the approach zone in which
the structure or tree is located.
A.

vertical height to be exclusive of and in addition to the vertical height
limit permitted at the outer end of Area B, within the approach zone in
which the structure or tree is located.
C.
Area D. One thirty-fourth of the shortest horizontal distance from the
structure or tree (or any part thereof) to a line 200 feet outward from

Conical surface. An elevation rising uniformly at a rate of one foot every
20 feet from 198 feet above mean sea level from the inner edge of the
conical surface (being also the outer edge of the horizontal surface) to

except that if § 53-4 requires a lower elevation within Area A, B, C, or
D, at the point in question, such lower elevation shall control.
B.
Transitional surfaces. The elevation of the transitional surface shall be
that of a set of planes sloping upward and outward from the edges of
Areas A, B, C, and D to meet the horizontal and conical surfaces. Each
plane shall rise one foot for every seven feet from the edge of Area A,
B, C or D, whichever may be applicable, measured horizontally at right
angles to the nearest runway centerline.
C.
§ 53-4 NANTUCKET CODE § 53-6

§ 53-6. Variances.
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or to
permit the growth of any tree, in a manner not conforming to the Airport
Approach Regulations as herein established, or to establish the right so to
do, may apply to the Airport Commission for a variance from the regulations
applicable to such person’s property. Such variance may be allowed where
a literal application or enforcement of such regulation would result in
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not
be contrary to public interest. Any permit or variance granted under this
section shall be conditioned as to require the owner of the Structure or tree
to permit the Airport Commission at its own expense to install, operate and
maintain suitable obstruction markings or obstruction lights thereon.
§ 53-7. Exemptions.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the growth,
erection or maintenance of a tree or structure to a height up to 20 feet

§ 100-1. Designation and authorization of Nantucket Housing
Authority. [Amended 4-1-2017 ATM by Art. 90, approved 5-31-2017]
By this chapter, which shall be known as Chapter 100 of the Code of
the Town of Nantucket, Massachusetts, the Town, pursuant to Section 2
of Chapter 301 of the Acts of 2002,22 as amended, hereby establishes
The Nantucket and Madaket Harbor Watersheds encompass those
areas of the Town, based on the definition of the Harbors’ watersheds,
within which human activities may affect the quality of the waters of
Nantucket and Madaket Harbors.
A.
It is in the public interest to delineate the boundaries of the Nantucket
and Madaket Harbor Watersheds, thus providing a frame of reference
for diverse, multijurisdictional strategies and activities which promote
the purposes of this section. In the future, these activities might include
structural improvements (i.e., dredging or other activities to enhance
water circulation, extension of sanitary sewers/package treatment
facilities to mitigate septic discharges, the retrofit of storm drainage
systems to reduce nutrient loading, and the development of planning
contingencies and improvements devised to support spill containment),
and regulatory activities, such as public health regulations. Open space
preservation activities, such as land acquisition and implementation
of conservation restrictions, by the Land Bank Commission and other
governmental and nonprofit entities are encouraged within the
watershed, because they reduce the land use impacts which can
degrade the water quality of these Harbors. It is also important that
educational strategies devised to inform the public of ways to preserve
the Harbors’ water quality have defined watersheds as frames of
reference.
B.
§ 99-3 NANTUCKET CODE § 100-1

the program hereafter to be known as the "Nantucket Housing Needs
Covenant Program" and designates the Nantucket Housing Authority (the
"Authority") as the agency to create, administer and enforce Nantucket
Housing Needs Covenants under the Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant
Program. The Authority may, pursuant to applicable law, implement the
Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant Program through contracts with
qualified entities, or by otherwise obtaining assistance for some or all
aspects of the Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant Program, if the
Authority determines that such assistance is in the public interest.
§ 100-2. Purpose and means. [Amended 4-1-2017 ATM by Art. 90,
approved 5-31-2017]
As set forth in Chapter 301 of the Acts of 2002, as amended, the purpose
of the Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant Program is to create, make
available and maintain housing that is affordable to those who earn less
than 150% of the Nantucket County median household income, from those
situated in lower income groups, to those situated in more moderate or
middle income groups, to help all these groups to continue to reside on
Nantucket if they wish to do so, and to generate and preserve affordable
housing in the Town of Nantucket in perpetuity, all in order to maintain
Nantucket's diversity and unique sense of community. To accomplish these
important community objectives, the Authority may, within the Nantucket
Needs Housing Program, create, administer and enforce a series of
Nantucket Housing Needs Covenants (an "NHNC").
§ 100-3. Subprograms; ownership and rental covenants.
Within the Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant Program, the Authority
may create and administer a series of subprograms and NHNCs, based
on different levels of household income, provided that no subprogram
or NHNC shall be created for or available to people or households
earning more than 150% of the Nantucket County median household
income (a "subprogram"), except for a "qualified family member" as
defined in § 139-8B(2) of Chapter 139, Zoning, of the Code of the Town
of Nantucket who shall be exempt from the established income and
asset limits of the Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant Program. For
illustration only, without limitation, a subprogram may be established
hereunder based on affordability to people or households earning at
or below 80% of the Nantucket County median income. For each
Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant Program subprogram there shall
be created an appropriate NHNC to effectuate said subprogram.
[Amended 4-1-2017 ATM by Art. 90, approved 5-31-2017]

provided below in § 100-5C.
A.
The Appeal Board shall conduct a special review for a waiver from the
strict application of this Chapter 100 or from the Nantucket Housing
Needs Program Covenant Regulations. The Appeal Board may, at its
sole discretion, grant a request for a waiver or waivers, with or without
conditions, if it finds that the approval of such waiver or waivers (1)
shall not substantially derogate from the intent and purpose of this
Chapter 100 and the Nantucket Housing Needs Program Covenant
Regulations, and (2) shall alleviate a substantial hardship for the
applicant(s) for such waiver or waivers.
B.
Pursuant to this Chapter 100 and to other applicable law, the Authority

99:159
NHNC or of the Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant Program Regulations
may be punished by a fine of not more than $300. Each day or part thereof
during which such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate
offense. As an alternative to criminal prosecution or civil action, the Town
of Nantucket may elect to utilize the non-criminal disposition procedure set
forth in MGL c. 40, § 21D, and in §§ 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5 and 1-6 of the Code of
the Town of Nantucket with a penalty of $300 for each violation, each day or
part thereof during which a violation occurs constituting a separate offense.
§ 100-7. Relation to Chapter 184 of Massachusetts General Laws.
[Amended 4-1-2017 ATM by Art. 90, approved 5-31-2017]
In the event that any NHNC may not be enforceable in perpetuity under
Chapter 301 of the Acts of 2002,24 as amended, or where the Authority
determines that it would further the intent and purpose of this Chapter
100, the Authority may require that, in addition to the requirements of this
Chapter 100, any NHNC also conform to the requirements of Chapter 184
of the Massachusetts General Laws, as amended, relative to the creation
and maintenance of perpetual affordable housing restrictions.
§ 100-8. Relation to Chapter 40B of Massachusetts General Laws.
At its discretion, consistent with this Chapter 100, the Authority, with the
Town's approval, to be obtained pursuant to applicable law, may take all
necessary steps to qualify any real property affected by an NHNC, for
inclusion in the Town's so-called "Subsidized Housing Inventory," as defined
by Chapter 408 of the Massachusetts General Laws, as amended, and
the regulations thereto. The Nantucket Housing Needs Program Covenant
Program, subprograms, NHNCs and regulations may contain provisions to
ensure inclusion of any real property affected by an NHNC in the Town's
Subsidized Housing Inventory, defined hereinabove.

The adoption of this form of Chapter 100 shall repeal, in its entirety, the
existing form of Chapter 100, and shall replace it with this form of Chapter
100. Notwithstanding the repeal and replacement of the previous form of
this Chapter 100, any and all agreements, covenants, rules, regulations and
the like created pursuant to previous forms of this Chapter 100 shall remain
in full force and effect, subject to the provisions of the form of Chapter 100,
and the regulations thereto, effective at the time of their recording or filing

OUTDOOR LIGHTING
GENERAL REFERENCES
Zoning — See Ch. 139.
§ 102-1. Purpose; applicability.
§ 102-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
Good outdoor lighting at night benefits everyone. It increases safety,
enhances the Town's nighttime character, and helps provide security.
New lighting technologies have produced lights that are extremely
powerful, and these types of lights may be improperly installed so that
they create problems of excessive glare, light trespass, and higher
energy use. Excessive glare can be annoying and may cause safety
problems. Light trespass reduces everyone's privacy, and higher energy
use results in increased costs for everyone. Light exposure to
ecosystems is known to interfere with the circadian rhythms of plants
and animals.
A.
There is a need for a lighting bylaw that recognizes the benefits of
outdoor lighting and provides clear guidelines for its installation so as
to help maintain and complement the Town's character. Appropriately
regulated, and properly installed, outdoor lighting will contribute to the
safety and welfare of the residents of the Town.
B.
The primary purpose of this chapter is intended to reduce the problems
created by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting. It is
intended to eliminate problems of glare, minimize light trespass, and
help reduce the energy and financial costs of outdoor lighting. It
establishes regulations that limit the wattages and lumens of outdoor
lights, the direction of lighting and the area that certain kinds of
outdoor lighting fixtures can illuminate.
C.
The secondary purpose of this chapter is to preserve the rural nature
of the countryside, enhance nighttime enjoyment of property, to protect
property values by controlling light trespass, and to enhance the
enjoyment of the night sky.
D.
All lighting standards in this chapter are applicable to all lighting and
no lighting shall be installed or continued that violates the standards of
this chapter.
E.
§ 101-6 OUTDOOR LIGHTING § 102-2
102:167
EVENT LIGHTING — Any lighting used for outdoor activities with large
public gatherings.
FIXTURE — The assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include
all or some of the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or pole
socket, a lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or
lens.
FLOOD or SPOTLIGHT — Any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a
reflector or a refractor to concentrate the light output into a directed beam
in a particular direction.
FOOTCANDLE — A measurable industry standard of illumination equivalent
to one lumen per square foot. Measured by a light meter.
FULL CUT-OFF FIXTURES — Fixtures, as installed, that are designed or
shielded in such a manner that all light rays emitted by the fixture, either
directly from the lamps or indirectly from the fixture, are projected below a
horizontal plane running through the lowest point on the fixture where light
is emitted.
GLARE — Light emitting from a light source with intensity great enough to
reduce a viewer's ability to see, and in extreme cases causing momentary
blindness.
HEIGHT OF LIGHT SOURCE — The height of a light source shall be the
vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the light
source to the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the light source.
IESNA — Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES or
IESNA), the professional society of lighting engineers, including those from
manufacturing companies, and others professionally involved in lighting.
INDIRECT LIGHT — Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off
of other surfaces.
LAMP — The component of a light source that produces the actual light.
LIGHT TRESPASS — Light falling where it is not wanted or needed,
generally caused by a light on a property that shines onto the property of
others.
OUTDOOR LIGHTING — The nighttime illumination of an outside area or
object by any man-made device located outdoors that produces light by any
means.
PARTIALLY SHIELDED — In which the bulb of the fixture is shielded by a
translucent siding and the bulb is not visible at all. Light may be emitted at
the horizontal level of the bulb.
UPLIGHTING — Lighting that is directed in such a manner as to shine light
rays above the horizontal plane.
§ 102-3. Regulations; prohibitions.
All residential fixtures with lamps of 600 lumens (about 40 watts
incandescent) or less per fixture are exempt from regulation.
A.
§ 102-2 NANTUCKET CODE § 102-3

All residential and commercial exterior lighting (except floodlights)
shall be contained in fixtures with an opaque top and translucent
sides (partially shielded) such that the bulb is not directly visible from
adjacent and neighboring properties or public rights-of-way.
B.
To minimize light trespass, in residential areas the light level at the
property line shall be no greater than 0.5 of a footcandle, measured at
a height of five feet above grade.
C.
Commercial property or properties containing mixed uses with a
commercial component may not have lighting which exceeds the
average minimum levels listed in the IESNA Recommended
Publications.
D.
Parking area lights in commercial areas are encouraged to be greater

uptight is captured.
(1)
To light local, state, or national flags, when no more than two
light fixtures per flagpole are used, with an equivalent total lumen
maximum of a 150 watt bulb (incandescent). The fixtures must
be shielded such that the lamp is not visible outside a fifteen-foot
radius. It is preferred that all flags be lowered at sunset

footcandles.
Motion sensors are the preferred method for controlling nighttime
illumination. The duration of illumination shall be no longer than
five minutes after the last detection of motion. Motion sensors are
only permitted where the sensor is triggered by activity within
the owner's property line. Full cutoff and fully shielded fixtures
controlled by photocells may be used in areas requiring maximum
security such as outdoor storage yards and at primary points of
entrance (e.g., front entries) or in critical common areas for
commercial and multifamily properties.
(1)

Department shall transmit the fingerprints it has obtained pursuant
to this bylaw to the Identification Section of the Massachusetts State
Police, the Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice Information

such suitability evaluation or communication shall be disseminated to
unauthorized entities.

and other applicable state laws.

the linear footage of such way/road. The petition shall be accompanied
by written proof evidencing ownership of the linear footage of each
abutter.
C.
The Town shall have no liability as a result of undertaking any such
repairs to private ways or roads, except as may be provided by law,
and shall be held harmless on account of any damages whatever caused
by such repairs by agreement executed by the abutters who petitioned
therefor.
D.
The private way/road shall have been opened to the public to use for
two years or more prior to the undertaking of such repairs.
E.
The Board of Selectmen shall determine the scope of repairs, including
whether and to what extent any of the following shall be undertaken:
grading, paving, resurfacing, scraping and filling of holes and
impressions with sand, gravel or other suitable materials. Drainage
repairs shall be included to the extent required by public convenience
and necessity, as determined by the Board of Selectmen, upon advice
and costs estimates from the Director of Public Works.
F.
The costs of the repairs and of borrowings undertaken by the Town
pursuant to Chapter 237 of the Acts of 1995 shall be apportioned
to and among the benefited property owners along the road so

at a rate established by the Board of Selectmen on recommendation
of the Town's Finance Director, such rate to be at a minimum rate
of 2% above the rate of interest charged said Town on any funds
borrowed by the Town for this purpose. The Finance Director shall
take appropriate steps to ensure that the Town shall record appropriate
orders to secure payment in the same manner as the Town acquires a
lien for a betterment assessment pursuant to MGL c. 80.

Both dwelling units shall be in the same ownership unless one of
the two dwelling units is subject to the NHNC. The ownership of a
lot by a condominium cooperative housing corporation, land trust, or
other common interest ownership entity in which there is a separate
beneficial ownership of the principal and secondary dwellings on the
lot shall not be deemed to constitute "the same legal and beneficial
ownership."
The Planning Board shall make a determination regarding the
adequacy of access to the lot and structures prior to the issuance
of a building permit. Planning Board approvals granted after April 8,
1996, shall be valid for a period of two years from the date of plan
endorsement.
The principal purpose of secondary dwellings is to create housing
opportunities through the provision of affordable rental housing for
year round residents, including senior citizens, while affording the
owner of the primary residence with the opportunity to generate
supplemental income. The intent of this provision is also that one of the
two dwellings be designated and constructed at such scale and bulk so
as to be clearly subordinate in both use and appearance.
Notwithstanding any language contained herein to the contrary, any
property that is owned by a validly created and existing cooperative
housing corporation as of December 31, 2012, may be converted to a
residential condominium form of ownership, maintaining the separate
beneficial ownership of the primary and secondary dwellings, without
subjecting such property to the Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant.57
SECONDARY LOTS — Lots created by the division of the original
lot into two lots pursuant to § 139-8C. One of the two lots shall be
subject to an NHNC-Ownership Form, or shall be owner-occupied by a
qualified family member, in which case the lot shall be subject to the
NHNC-Ownership Form, except for the established income and asset
limits.[Added 4-6-2009 ATM by Art. 27, AG approval 8-10-2009;

residents. [Amended 4-5-2014 ATM by Art. 63, AG approval
5-7-2014; 4-2-2016 ATM by Arts. 54, 55, AG approval 7-12-2016]
Purpose: to create, make available and maintain housing that is
affordable to those who earn at or below 150% of the Nantucket
County median household income; to help those people or
households to continue to reside on Nantucket; to generate and
preserve affordable housing in the Town of Nantucket in perpetuity,
all in order to maintain Nantucket's diversity and unique sense of
community.
(1)
Secondary lots may be permitted in the following zoning districts:
ROH, R-5, R-10, R-20, R-40, VR, LUG-1, LUG-2, and LUG-3.
(2)
As authorized by MGL c. 40A, § 9, Paragraph 2, the Planning Board,
acting as the special permit granting authority, may issue a special
permit authorizing the division of a lot into two lots, provided the
following requirements and/or conditions shall apply:
The original lot shall not be subject to any covenants,
restrictions or similar encumbrances, whether appearing in
a deed, easement, land-use permit or any other instrument,
pertaining to the prohibition of more than one dwelling unit on
the original lot.
(a)
One of the two lots shall be subject to an NHNC-Ownership
Form, which shall provide, without limitation, that the owner
of that lot shall earn at or below 150% of the Nantucket County
median household income. Secondary lots sold to qualified
family members shall not be subject to the income and asset
limits for eligible households. Upon resale, transfer, or gift of
the secondary lot to a nonqualified family member, the lot shall
be subject to an NHNC-Ownership Form, and all requirements
set forth therein, including income and asset limits for eligible
households.
(b)
The lots shall not be subject to the secondary dwelling
requirements contained within § 139-2 of this chapter.
[Amended 4-1-2017 ATM by Art. 74, AG approval
5-31-2017]
(c)
One of the two lots shall be allowed to have a second dwelling
unit, subject to the requirements of the tertiary dwelling
definition contained within § 139-2 of this chapter. [Added
4-1-2017 ATM by Art. 74, AG approval 5-31-2017]
(d)
Except for pre-existing nonconforming lots, in which case the
Planning Board may issue a special permit defining the lot
areas, the lot area for the smaller of the two lots shall be at
least 40% of the minimum lot size for the district in which the
(e)
(3)
C.
§ 139-8 WETLANDS § 139-8
136:309
lot is located, except in the LUG-2 and LUG-3 Districts, where
the secondary lot may be reduced to 20,000 square feet.
The lots shall comply with the ground cover ratio, front
setback, and side and rear setback requirements of the
underlying zoning district, including any provisions of this
chapter for pre-existing nonconforming lots, except as follows:
The Planning Board may waive by the issuance of a special
permit the setback requirements only as they apply to the
lot line(s) between the secondary lots;
[1]
The Planning Board may waive by the issuance of a special
permit the ground cover ratio requirement for the
secondary lots, provided that the total ground cover, ratio
does not exceed the amount that would have been allowed
for the original lot;
[2]
(f)
The lots each must have a minimum of 20 feet of frontage or
an easement of sufficient width and grade to provide access.
(g)
The lots shall share a single driveway access. The Planning
Board must be provided with an instrument, in recordable
form, evidencing the common access rights to said access
in accordance with this subsection. The Planning Board may
grant a special permit to waive the requirement for shared
driveway access based upon a finding that separate driveway
access would not have a significant and adverse effect on the
scenic or historic integrity of the neighborhood and is not
contrary to sound traffic or safety considerations.
(h)
This § 139-8C shall not apply to major commercial developments
(§ 139-11); flex development and open space residential
development options (§ 139-8A); and are not permitted in the
following zoning districts: Commercial Downtown (CDT);
Moorlands Management (MMD).
(4)
The Planning Board may grant a special permit for the division
of a duplex into two attached single-family dwellings, provided
that one of the dwellings is subject to a NHNC-Ownership Form.
Subsection C(3)(e) and (f) above shall not apply and the Planning
Board shall establish minimum lot size, ground cover ratio, and
setbacks during the special permit review. Ground cover ratios
for the primary and secondary lot combined shall not exceed the
maximum allowed in the underlying zoning district.
(5)
Section 139-16D, Regularity formula, shall not apply to this
§ 139-8C.

homeownership housing in the R-5 Zoning District through a workforce
homeownership housing bonus lots allowance and in the CN and CMI
D.
§ 139-8 NANTUCKET CODE § 139-8
136:310
Zoning Districts through a workforce rental community. The purpose of
this provision is to incentivize the creation of workforce and affordable
rental and ownership housing opportunities; to promote consistency,
quality, and flexibility in the site layout and design; to mitigate traffic
congestion by encouraging the creation of compact neighborhoods
proximate to compatible adjacent commercial uses that reduce the
need for vehicle trips to already congested areas; and to promote
economic vitality and a greater diversity of housing opportunities in
compliance with objectives contained within plans adopted or accepted
by the Town of Nantucket, Nantucket Planning and Economic
Development Commission, or the Nantucket Housing Authority. This
bylaw, which sets a minimum size lot area, is intended to allow for
aggregation of buildings, parking spaces, and open areas to improve
design quality. Consistent design quality shall be applied to all dwelling
units, and affordable units shall be distributed evenly throughout the
development. [Added 11-9-2015 STM by Art. 2, AG approval
12-29-2015; amended 4-2-2016 ATM by Art. 36, AG approval
7-12-2016]
Requirements.
The following requirements shall apply to workforce
homeownership housing bonus lots in the R-5 Zoning District
and to a workforce housing rental community in the CN and
CMI Zoning Districts.
Minimum lot requirement of 60,000 square feet in the CN
District and 32,000 square feet in the CMI District:
[1]
The term of affordability shall be in perpetuity or the
longest term allowed by law;
[2]
[3] The application shall be subject to major site plan review;
The Planning Board shall be the sole special permit
granting authority for any relief pursuant to any provision
of this chapter;
[4]
Planning Board approval of a special permit shall not
substitute for approval of a definitive subdivision or
approval not required (ANR) plan;
[5]
Project must be eligible for approval as local action units
(LAU) through the Local Initiative Program (LIP) or
otherwise included on the Town's Subsidized Housing
Inventory. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure the units are
included, including, without limitation, preparation and
execution of a regulatory agreement in a form to be
approved by the Town of Nantucket, through its Board
of Selectmen, and by the Department of Housing and

Workforce homeownership housing bonus lots.
Bonus lots, subject to the requirements below, shall be based
on the number of building lots which could have been created
through a conventional subdivision plan. The maximum
number of building lots, excluding any bonuses, shall not
exceed the number which may have otherwise been created
on a conventional subdivision plan meeting all dimensional
and upland requirements of the Zoning Bylaw and in full
conformance with (and requiring no waivers from) the Rules
and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land, as may
be amended by the Planning Board from time to time, as
demonstrated by the submission of a dimensioned lotting plan.
For all density calculations that result in a fractional number,
only fractions equal to or greater than 0.51 should be rounded
to the next highest whole number.
The total number of lots shall be calculated by multiplying
the number of lots allowed by-right, as described above, by
a factor of 1.33.
[1]
25% of the total number of lots allowed, using the bonus
provision, must be allocated and restricted to ownership
by households earning at or below the area median income
limits set forth in the definition of "workforce
homeownership housing," as defined in § 139-2, or the
rental dwelling units located on the lots achieved through
the bonus provision must be restricted to households
earning at or below 80% of area median income. Said lots
shall be subject to a Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant-
Ownership Form or other instrument restricting sale or
rental to households earning at or below the area median
income limits set forth in the definition of workforce
homeownership housing, as defined in § 139-2.
[2]
(a)
The Planning Board may reduce, by up to 100%: the front
yard setback (but not the side or rear yard setbacks applied
to the perimeter of the project area), internal side or rear
yard setbacks (meaning setbacks between lots which are the
subject of the application), side or rear yard setbacks between
the lots which are the subject of the application and other
land in common ownership or control of the applicant, and the
required frontage, provided that the lot has sufficient vehicular
access through an easement.
(b)
The Planning Board may allow an increase in the ground cover
ratio up to 50%.
(c)
(2)
§ 139-8 NANTUCKET CODE § 139-8
136:312
A minimum buffer area of at least 20 feet shall be established
between the workforce homeownership housing bonus lots and
residentially zoned abutting properties. The Planning Board
may require the buffer area to include plantings, fencing,
walls, or other improvements to mitigate impacts to abutting
properties.
(d)
Workforce rental community.
Rental dwelling units in one or more structures, shall be
subject to the following requirements:
The maximum number of dwelling units shall not exceed
32, at least eight of which must (25% of which) be
restricted to occupancy by households earning at or below
80% of area median income. An instrument, in a form
approved by the Planning Board, restricting rental of at
least eight of the dwelling units to households earning at
or below 80% of area median income must encumber the
subject lot(s);
[1]
The maximum number of bedrooms contained within the
workforce rental community lot shall not exceed 57;
[2]
At least 10% of the total dwelling units within the
workforce housing rental community must contain at least
three bedrooms, unless such requirement is reduced by
a future binding directive from the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community
Development which confirms that fewer than 10% threebedroom
units may be included in the workforce rental
community while still confirming that all of the units in the
workforce rental community shall be eligible for inclusion
on the Town's Subsidized Housing Inventory. In such an
instance, the Planning Board shall have the discretion to
approve fewer three-bedroom units within the workforce
rental community, in conjunction with the issuance of the
special permit, as long as the requirement described above
with respect to confirmation of the eligibility of all of
the units in the workforce rental community relative to
inclusion on the Town's Subsidized Housing Inventory has
been met.
[3]
(a)
A minimum buffer area of at least 20 feet shall be established
between the workforce rental community and residentially
zoned abutting properties. The Planning Board may require
the buffer area to include plantings, fencing, walls, or other
improvements to mitigate impacts to abutting properties.
(b)
The Planning Board may, in addition to those requirements
included in § 139-23, require submission of additional
documentation, including, without limitation, detailed floor
(c)
(3)
§ 139-8 WETLANDS § 139-8
136:313
plans, operation and management plan for the project,
including maintenance of the structure(s) and the site.
The Planning Board may reduce, by up to 100%, the side
and rear yard setbacks where two or more workforce rental
community lot projects are adjacent to each other.
(d)
The Planning Board may allow a workforce rental community as
part of a larger project, as allowed in the CN and CMI Districts,
provided that the project, comprised of one or more parcels of land
in the same ownership or control, could be divided into multiple
lots meeting the lot requirement of § 139-8D(1)(a)[1] on a
conventional subdivision plan meeting all dimensional and upland
requirements of the bylaw and consistent with the Rules and
Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land, as may be
amended by the Planning Board from time to time, as demonstrated
by the submission of a dimensioned lotting plan. [Added

(4)
Special permit to create rear lot subdivisions. [Added 4-1-2017 ATM
by Art. 72, AG approval 5-31-2017]
Purpose: to provide a residential infill development option that
allows for the same density that could be created by a conventional
subdivision, but that does not create unnecessary un-taxed
roadway lots.
(1)
Rear lots may be permitted in the following zoning districts: R-5,
R-10, R-20, R-40, and LUG-1.
(2)
As authorized by MGL c. 40A, § 9, Paragraph 2, the Planning Board,
acting as the special permit granting authority, may issue a special
permit authorizing the division of a lot into two or more lots,
provided the following requirements and/or conditions shall apply:
(a) A minimum frontage of 20 feet shall apply to each lot;
The ground cover ratio, front setback, and side and rear
setback requirements of the underlying zoning district shall
apply to each lot;
(b)
The regularity formula prescribed in § 139-16D shall not apply
to lots created pursuant to this subsection;
(c)
The number of buildings lots shall not exceed the number
which may have otherwise been created on a conventional
subdivision plan meeting all dimensional and upland
requirements of the Zoning Bylaw and the requirements
contained within the "Rules and Regulations Governing the
Subdivision of Land," as may be amended from time to time, as
demonstrated by the submission of a dimensioned lotting plan.

(8)
Preexisting nonconforming uses shall be subject to this subsection
when any extended or altered portion of the commercial use(s), added
together starting from the effective date (April 4, 1979, as amended),
meets or exceeds the criteria of Subsection B above, which defines a
MCD.
C.
Conditions. The Planning Board shall have the right, in granting special
permits for major commercial developments, to impose conditions,
safeguards and limitations, including, but not limited to, the following
requirements:
A landscaping plan, indicating the location, species, and size of
trees and shrubs and the location and type of fencing.
(1)
An exterior lighting plan indicating the size and type of any
proposed fixtures.
(2)
(3) The installation of underground utilities.
(4) A plan indicating the type, size and location of all exterior signs.
The days and hours of operation may be limited based on the
type of business, the character of the surrounding areas, and the
potential impacts to adjacent properties or the surrounding
neighborhood.
(5)
D.
Open area for major commercial developments.
Except for lots located within the CDT District, a minimum of 20%
of the lot(s) shall be landscaped and maintained as open area.
(1)
Walkways and sidewalks, patios, structures, and areas designated
for exterior storage, parking or loading shall not be included in the
open area calculation; provided, however, that in computing the
percentage of open area, brick or stone sidewalks and patios may
be included up to a maximum of 10% of the lot(s).
(2)
The Planning Board may grant a special permit to waive the
requirement for open area, provided that the Board finds that
(3)
E.
§ 139-11 NANTUCKET CODE § 139-11
136:316
sufficient and appropriate landscaping will be provided and that
the benefits to the community and the neighborhood from the
reduction of open area will outweigh the benefits that would be
derived from the provision of the open area requirements. The
special permit granting authority may impose conditions for the
granting of such a special permit, including, but not limited to,
the substitution of off-site landscaping elements, a financial or
other type of contribution toward the creation of common public
space(s), and requirements for the permanent maintenance of
landscaping features within the site by the applicant and its
successors.
Any expansion or reconstruction of, or any changes to, a major
commercial development for which a special permit has been granted
shall require its modification or issuance of a new special permit by the
Planning Board subject to the procedural and substantive requirements
of §§ 139-11 and 139-30. However, the Planning Board may, by majority
vote, waive the requirements for such modified or new special permit
when it finds that the expansion, reconstruction or change proposed
does not materially affect the findings and conclusions upon which the
Planning Board's previous decision to approve the development was
based.
F.
The side and rear yard setback requirement be reduced to zero feet,
provided that the Planning Board finds that such a reduction will
preserve the integrity of adjacent uses and the neighborhood, and will
promote the purposes and intent of this chapter.
G.
In order to further the availability of housing for persons and
households of all income levels, and mitigate the impacts of major
commercial developments on the supply and cost of housing, the
Planning Board may require applicants to provide inclusionary housing
in accordance with the following standards:
One inclusionary unit for each 4,000 feet of gross floor area of
interior commercial use or one inclusionary unit per major
commercial development, whichever is greater.
(1)
The inclusionary unit(s) may be located on the MCD site or at an
off-site location.
(2)
(3) (Reserved)
In lieu of providing inclusionary units or employer dormitories as
outlined above, an applicant may provide a monetary contribution
of equivalent value to the Town of Nantucket, to be placed in a
fund for the development of affordable housing administered by the
Affordable Housing Trust Fund. The amount of such contribution
shall be equivalent to the average sale price of residential property
with 5,000 square foot to 10,000 square foot lot sizes in the R-5
district as recorded by the Nantucket Islands Land Bank during
the one-year period prior to approval of the special permit. This

payment may be used only for the planning, development and
administration and maintenance of affordable housing.
Where the inclusionary units are provided on the MCD site, the
Planning Board may allow an increase in the number of units that
may be permitted within a single structure or upon a single lot
beyond that which is permitted in the zoning district in which the
units are located.

Inclusionary units shall be subject to a deed restriction,
enforceable by the Planning Board or its designee, to be in effect
during the thirty-year period which commences from the date of
issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the building in which
the unit(s) is located.

more of gross floor area of commercial use, including roofedover
storage areas.
(a)
Expansion of an existing commercial development whenever
the expanded portion of the development, added together

Statement of purpose. The purposes of the Flood Hazard Overlay
District (FHOD) are to ensure public safety through reducing the
(1)
A.
§ 139-11 NANTUCKET CODE § 139-12
136:318
threats to life and personal injury; prevent the occurrence of public
emergencies resulting from water quality contamination and
pollution due to flooding; avoid the loss of utility services which
if damaged by flooding would disrupt or shut down the utility
network and impact the community beyond the site of flooding;
reduce costs associated with the response and cleanup of flooding
conditions; reduce damage to public and private property resulting
from flooding waters.
Use regulations. The FHOD is herein established as an overlay
district to all other districts. The FHOD includes all special flood
hazard areas within the Town of Nantucket designated as Zone
A, AE, or VE on the Nantucket County Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) for the administration of the National Flood Insurance
Program. The map panels of the Nantucket County FIRM that are

The purpose of the Town Overlay District is to limit the spatial
extent of growth within a district consistent with the traditional
settlement pattern represented by the settled portion of Nantucket
Town, except in the Residential Old Historic (ROH) District; to
encourage development within the Town Overlay District where
infrastructure already exists, or can be extended without undue
expense; to create opportunities to produce housing affordable for
year-round residents through infill development (development of
existing vacant lots; lots produced by resubdivision; and addition
of secondary dwellings) on existing roads serviced by water and
sewer; and to create development patterns that are conducive to
service by alternatives to the automobile, such as transit, and
bicycle and pedestrian systems. The purpose of the Town Overlay
District shall be considered by the Planning Board or Zoning Board
of Appeals when determining the character and extent of site
and infrastructure improvements to be required in a decision on
an application for site plan approval pursuant to § 139-23 of this
chapter. In addition to the standards of that section, the following
standards shall apply to a proposed use or an expansion of an
existing use subject to site plan review:
Provision of Town water and sewer service, which shall be
adequate to serve the proposed use;
(a)
Road and drainage improvements shall be adequate to serve
the proposed use;
(b)
Bike and/or pedestrian systems shall be adequate to serve
the proposed use, and reasonable measures shall be taken to
provide connectivity to existing bike and pedestrian systems;

The purpose of the Country Overlay District is to discourage
development and preserve areas characterized by traditional and
historic rural land use patterns; to discourage the spread of
disperse development patterns that promote automobile
dependency, and are costly to build and maintain. The purpose of
the Country Overlay District shall be considered by the Planning
Board or Zoning Board of Appeals when determining the character
and extent of site and infrastructure improvements to be required
in a decision on an application for site plan approval pursuant
to § 139-23 of this chapter. In addition to the standards of that
section, the following standards shall apply to a proposed use or an
expansion of an existing use subject to site plan review:
If a new use, or an expansion of a preexisting use that adds
20% or more of the gross floor area or 1,000 square feet,
of gross floor area, whichever is less, either subject to site
plan review, a finding that the applicant has considered all
practicable alternative sites, commensurate with the type, size,
and cost of the project, available within the Town Overlay
District and that no such practicable alternative exists;

with the general guidance of the Mid-Island Area Plan, adopted for the
Town of Nantucket by the Planning Board on March 10, 2003, on file
in the office of the Nantucket Planning Board. The MIPOD is located
and bounded as shown on the following maps adopted by reference
herein: “Mid-Island Planned Overlay District,” January, 2003; revised
March, 2003. The district as shown on said map shall be considered an
overlay district to be superimposed on the Zoning Map of Nantucket,

Allowed uses:
All uses allowed on the lot by right in the underlying district
in which the land is located. Notwithstanding the provisions
of §§ 139-23H(3) and 139-23I, all new commercial uses or
expansions of commercial uses that entail expansions of the
building footprint or parking and circulation improvements
(excluding handicap ramps and signage), and which are not
otherwise subject to major site plan review, shall be subject to
minor site plan review by the Director of Planning designated
by the Planning Board for site plan review purposes set down
in this § 139-12G, and such professional planning staff to whom
the Director of Planning shall delegate this responsibility, for
all commercial uses and expansions up to, and including, 3,999
square feet of gross commercial floor area (including roofed
over area).
(a)
(1)
Uses by special permit:
All uses permitted on the lot requiring a special permit in the
underlying district in which the lot is located.
(a)
(2)
Additional requirements within the MIPOD:
The Planning Board shall be the special permit granting
authority for all commercial uses requiring a special permit
within the MIPOD.
(a)
In reviewing a use or expansion requiring either a minor or
major site plan review within the MIPOD, the Planning Board
and/or the Director of Planning or his designee shall make
a determination that the proposed use or improvements are
generally consistent with site plan review standards contained
in § 139-23, and with the standards set down in this § 139-12G.
(b)
(3)
§ 139-12 WETLANDS § 139-12
136:329
Notwithstanding the ground cover requirements of § 139-16,
the allowable ground cover ratio for a lot within the MIPOD
for which a Nantucket Housing Needs Covenant, as defined in
§ 139-2A, has been recorded in the Registry of Deeds shall be
55% for a lot containing one year-round dwelling unit subject
to the covenant, and 60% for two or more year-round dwelling
units subject to the covenant.
(c)
In addition to the intensity requirements of § 139-16A, new
or expanded commercial buildings within the MIPOD shall be
subject to a five-foot maximum front-yard setback. A second
commercial building on the same lot shall be exempt from this
requirement should the Planning Board and/or the Director
of Planning or his designee determine that there exists
insufficient frontage to accommodate both structures at the
maximum setback line. The Planning Board may grant relief by
special permit from this and other requirements of § 139-16A
should the Board find that:
The granting of relief would create better consistency with
existing building setback patterns on adjoining lots,
provided that the accommodation of parking or vehicular
access in front of buildings is not the reason for the waiver
request; or
[1]
The provision of additional landscaping and streetscape
elements, especially if designed to enhance the use and
enjoyment of the property and the Mid-Island area,
generally, by pedestrians necessitates a greater building
setback.
[2]
(d)
Notwithstanding the relief provisions and findings of
§ 139-18B(1) and (2), parking calculations, in compliance with
§ 139-18D shall include: (i) any off-street parking spaces
provided upon the subject property; and (ii) parking spaces
located within a public right-of-way within 500 feet of the
subject property’s lot lines. Any portion of a parking space so
located shall be counted as one space; and (iii) parking spaces
located on another property located within 500 feet of the
subject property lot line secured by a binding agreement such
as a license, lease or covenant and accessible through a direct
access. By special permit, the Planning Board may reduce the
number of parking spaces required under § 139-18D within the
MIPOD. An applicant requesting such reductions shall submit a
plan outlining the details of implementation of these mitigation
measures. The Planning Board may require annual audits of
compliance with these measures, and may revoke any
approved reductions in the case of noncompliance, following
a public hearing. The Planning Board shall consider the
following standards in reducing parking requirements: (i) one
parking space may be eliminated for each group of three peak
(e)
§ 139-12 NANTUCKET CODE § 139-12
136:330
shift employees should the applicant provide a public transit
incentive program for both employees and customers
authorized under § 139-23J(2)(f). (ii) The total number of
required parking spaces may be reduced by up to 10% should
the applicant utilize any or a combination of the following
measures: common access, vehicular traffic and/or pedestrian
interconnections between properties. The Planning Board may
grant other relief by special permit from any parking
requirements of the zoning bylaw.
In considering any use or expansion subject to major site plan
review, the Planning Board may require an applicant to install
improvements within the public right-of-way along the
frontage of the property controlled by the applicant in
accordance with the Mid-Island Area Plan. Off-site
improvements (i.e., beyond the frontage of the property) may
be required for special permit uses to the extent that the
demand for the improvements is justified by the intensity of
the use. For major traffic generators, these improvements may
include bike path, road and intersection improvements.
(f)
The Planning Board, as special permit granting authority, shall
have the power to grant a special permit reducing the open
area requirements under either § 139-11G or § 139-16E,
whichever is applicable, and notwithstanding the provisions
of § 139-16E(3), provided that it makes the finding that the
applicant has provided sufficient and appropriate landscaping,
and further provided that it makes the finding that the benefits
to the community and the neighborhood from the reduction
of open area requirements, as conditioned by the decision
granting the special permit, will outweigh the benefits that
would be derived from the provision of the open area
requirements as would otherwise be required. The Planning
Board shall impose appropriate conditions for the granting
of such a special permit, including but not limited to the
substitution of off-site landscaping elements, the contribution
of the applicant toward the creation of common public spaces
within the MIPOD, and requirements for the permanent
maintenance of landscaping features within the site by the
applicant and its successors.
(g)
In connection with its review of any major or minor site plan
review, the Planning Board, after public hearing, shall adopt
MIPOD Guidelines, on file in the offices of the Planning Board
and the Town Clerk, which shall serve to guide the siting
of structures, layout of parking and landscaping, and related
improvements within the MIPOD.

H.
§ 139-12 WETLANDS § 139-12
136:331
The Formula Business Exclusion District (FBED) is located and
bounded as shown on the map entitled "Article 42: Proposed
Formula Business Exclusion District" prepared by the GIS
Department, dated March 2006.
(1)
Statement of purpose. The purpose and intent of the Formula
Business Exclusion District (FBED) is to address the adverse
impact of nationwide, standardized businesses on Nantucket's
historic downtown area. The proliferation of formula businesses
will have a negative impact on the island's economy, historical
relevance, and unique character and economic vitality. These uses
are therefore prohibited in order to maintain a unique retail and
dining experience. Formula businesses frustrate this goal by
detracting from the overall historic island experience and
threatening its tourist economy.

endangered landform of North America. Along coastal areas, they may
also include flood-prone areas, glacial valleys and coastal pond systems.
It is the intention of this district to permit a type and integrity of
use which is consistent with the long-term integrity of these special
ecological systems. [Amended 5-4-1993 ATM by Art. 43, AG

the Moorlands Management District, the Planning Board shall have the
authority to review and approve the siting of said structure(s) on the lot
in accordance with the following performance standards:
To maximize the protection of endangered plant and animal species
through the siting of structures and uses a maximum distance
away from known or suspected habitats of such species, even when
such habitats are located off-site; to minimize disturbance to such
species by limiting construction activities to certain times of the
year.
(1)
To maximize the protection of scenic views through the siting of
structures on lower elevations, and clustering of structures near
other structures located off-site.
(2)
To maximize protection of moorlands and heath-land vegetation
and landforms through the use of various measures, including,
but not limited to, limitations on grading, fencing, landscaping,
driveway and parking facilities, and other physical disruptions to
indigenous natural systems.

(1)
The Board of Appeals may grant a special permit to validate
unintentional setback intrusions not greater than five feet into a
required yard and not closer than four feet from a lot line, provided
that it shall first find that the burden of correcting the intrusion
substantially outweighs any benefit to an abutter of eliminating the
intrusion and, if the intruding structure was so sited after 1990,
the siting of the structure was reasonably based upon a licensed
survey.
(2)
For lots abutting two or more streets or ways, whether constructed
or not, the required front yard setback shall be maintained from
one street or way, and the required side yard setback shall be
maintained from each other lot line, except in the R-1 and RC-2
Districts, where a minimum ten-foot side yard setback shall be
maintained from any other street or way, whether constructed or
not.
(3)
In the R-5 District only, the ten-foot side yard setback may be
reduced to five feet under one of the following conditions:
A five-foot side yard setback may apply to a secondary dwelling
or accessory structure that is located within 20 feet of the rear
lot line.
(a)
Where a common driveway of at least 10 feet in width is
provided to allow access to two or more lots.
(b)
(4)
C.
Regularity formula.
The regularity factor of any lot shall not be less than 0.55. The
regularity factor shall be determined by the formula:
r = 16A/p2 where
r = regularity factor
A = land area in square feet
p = perimeter in feet
(1)
That part of the lot area in excess of the required lot area may be
excluded from the regularity formula in determining the regularity

factor. The perimeter containing the excess area shall not include
the required frontage.
The regularity formula shall not apply to lots recorded or endorsed
prior to April 15, 1980.
(3)
Open area.
Except for lots within the CDT District, a lot containing a
commercial building, structure or use shall have a minimum of 20%
of the land as open area free from impervious surfaces. [Amended
4-2-2016 ATM by Art. 60, AG approval 7-12-2016]
(1)
Impervious surfaces here include, but are not limited to, paved and
gravelled areas, walkways and sidewalks, patios, decking, game
courts, pools, buildings and other structures, and areas designated
for parking or loading; provided, however, that in computing the
percentage of open area, brick sidewalks may be counted as open
area up to a maximum of 10% of the lot or site.
(2)
Relief from this open area requirement may be obtained by special
permit by the special permit granting authority, provided that it
makes the express finding that the applicant has provided sufficient
and appropriate landscaping; and further provided that it makes
the finding that the benefits to the community and the
neighborhood from the reduction of open area requirements, as
conditioned by the decision granting the special permit, will
outweigh the benefits that would be derived from the provision
of the open area requirements as would otherwise be required.
The special permit granting authority shall impose appropriate
conditions for the granting of such a special permit, including, but
not limited to, the substitution for off-site landscaping elements,
the contribution of the applicant toward the creation of common
public spaces, and requirements for the permanent maintenance
of landscaping features within the site by the applicant and its
successors. [Amended 4-30-2003 ATM by Art. 53, AG approval
8-27-2003]

Except in the CDT District, no land shall be used and no building
or structure shall be erected, enlarged or used unless the off-street
parking space requirements are met as specified in this § 139-18.
For the purpose of this § 139-18, an enlargement of any building
or a change in use of a building, which increases the parking
requirements beyond what currently exists, shall require the
provision of off-street parking for the existing building as if it were
newly constructed.
(1)
When a lot is used for more than one use, parking requirements
shall be computed for each use.
(2)
Where the computation of required parking space results in a
fractional number, only the fraction of 0.50 or more shall be
counted as one.
(3)
Required off-street parking spaces shall be provided on the same
lot as the principal or accessory use they are required to serve.
(4)
Parking upon a lot shall be located entirely within delineated
parking areas. Delineated shall mean, for the purposes of this
subsection, a parking area defined by edging or surface material so
that it can be differentiated from surrounding yard or landscaped
areas. Continuous use of landscaped areas to meet parking needs
shall be deemed a change of use and may require additional
screening as noted in this sub-section;
(5)
Head-in, ninety-degree parking spaces and forty-five-degree
parking spaces shall not be less than nine feet in width and 20
feet in length. The required length for parallel parking spaces shall
not be less than 20 feet. For residential parking only, one required
parking space may be reduced to a minimum dimension of seven
feet in width and 17 feet in length.
(6)
Parking areas containing five or more spaces required for a
commercial use shall be so arranged as not to require backing of
vehicles onto any street or way.
(7)
Stacked or tandem parking spaces are allowed for residential uses
only.

Purpose. This § 139-20.1 regulating driveway access is enacted under
the authority of MGL c. 40A for the purposes of protecting the safety
and general welfare of the inhabitants of the Town of Nantucket, by
the creation of standards, guidelines and regulatory and administrative
processes governing the creation of driveway access within all zoning
districts.
A.
Regulation of driveway access. No building permit in connection with
a building or use which creates a new driveway access onto a public
B.
§ 139-19 NANTUCKET CODE § 139-20.1
136:352
right-of-way, or private right-of-way intended for public use, shall be
issued, nor use established, until such driveway access has been
approved by the Nantucket Department of Public Works (DPW), as
complying with the requirements of § 139-20.1B(2). This requirement
may be waived for individual driveway accesses on lots shown on a
definitive subdivision which has been endorsed by the Planning Board
pursuant to the Subdivision Control Law, MGL c. 41, § 81K et seq., and
for which a certification by the DPW has been received by the Planning
Board that the driveway accesses within the subdivision comply with
the requirements of § 139-20.1B(2).
No more than one driveway access shall be allowed on a lot.
However, the Planning Board may grant a waiver to allow two or
more driveway accesses in accordance with § 139-20.1C.
(1)
Minimum driveway standards associated with driveway accesses.
No request for approval of a driveway access permit shall be
approved unless the driveway complies with the following
minimum standards: [Amended 4-15-2003 ATM by Art. 30, AG
approval 8-27-2003; 4-12-2004 ATM by Art. 45, AG approval
9-3-2004; 4-13-2005 ATM by Art. 40, AG approval 8-5-2005;
4-5-2014 ATM by Art. 62, AG approval 5-7-2014]
Driveways shall be designed and constructed so as not to result
in the direction of stormwater runoff, and soil, stones, or other
debris, onto or within the intersecting right-of-way.
(a)
No driveway access shall be located closer than 25 feet from
the curbline of an intersecting street, measured from the
nearest point of the driveway.
(b)
Driveways shall be constructed with a slope not exceeding 12%
at their intersection with the street. The DPW may approve a
greater slope based on a finding that a lesser slope is infeasible
due to the topography or other natural characteristics of the
site, and the driveway is designed using sound engineering
practice.
(c)
Any new or modified driveways intersecting with a public or
private paved road shall have a cobblestone, belgium block,
concrete, brick, asphalt apron, or other hard surface material.
The apron shall extend across the entire width of the driveway
and shall have a minimum depth of 10 feet behind the edge of
pavement.
(d)
Any areas disturbed in connection with the construction of
the driveway shall be stabilized to prevent erosion and
sedimentation of the subject property, adjacent property, and
of the intersecting street. Adjoining drainage structures shall
be protected from sedimentation. Disturbed areas shall be
loamed and seeded immediately following construction, or
(e)
(2)
§ 139-20.1 WETLANDS § 139-20.1
136:353
temporary erosion control measures used outside of the
growing season.
The width of driveway accesses shall be measured at the limit
of the traveled way within the street right-of-way.
Driveway width for commercial uses shall be a minimum
of 12 feet and a maximum of 30 feet, excluding corner
roundings which may have a maximum radius of 5 feet.
[1]
Driveway access for residential uses shall be cleared free
of vegetation and obstruction to a minimum width of 12
feet and a minimum height of 13 feet. The travelled
surface of the driveway shall be a minimum of 10 feet
in width and a maximum of 15 feet in width, excluding
corner rounding which may have maximum radius of 2
feet. A residential driveway access not exceeding 20 feet in
width (excluding corner rounding with a maximum radius
of 2 feet) may be allowed subject to its conformance with
standards as shown in Option 1, below and subject to
conditions set forth in Subsection B(2)(g) below. In the R-5
District only, 2 such driveways may be constructed on a
single lot, provided that the driveways are separated by at
least 5 feet of landscaping or walkway as shown in Option
2, below. Tandem parking extensions to any such driveway
configuration as shown in Options 3 and 4, below, may be
allowed through the issuance of a special permit by the
Planning Board.

Demolition delay. [Added 4-14-1997 ATM by Art. 40, AG
approval 8-5-1997]
Statement of purpose. The purpose of this section is to
establish a predictable process for reviewing requests to
demolish residential structures in order to:
Establish an appropriate waiting period during which the
Town and the applicant can propose and consider
alternatives to the demolition of a building of residential
value;
[1]
Minimize the quantity of demolition debris ending up in
the landfill;
[2]
[3] Create an incentive for reuse of residential structures;
Give interested parties an opportunity to acquire reusable
residential structures.
[4]
(a)
Buildings subject to demolition delay. All residential structures
are subject to review by the Building Commissioner for the
purpose of determining whether such buildings have any
residential reuse potential.
(b)
Issuance of demolition permit. The requirements set forth in
this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the
requirements of any other codes, ordinances, statutes, or
regulations applicable to the demolition of buildings. No
demolition permit shall be issued for a building that is subject
to review, pursuant to Subsection A(1)(b) above, unless:
It is determined that demolition is necessary, pursuant to
Subsection A(1)(d) below.
[1]
It is determined that said building has no residential reuse
potential due to the existing condition of the structure
or physical barriers to moving the structure such as
significant trees, bridges, etc.
[2]
The demolition delay period set forth in Subsection A(1)(f)
below has expired.
[3]
(c)
Required demolition or repair.
Demolition. Nothing in this section shall restrict any
authority in the general laws for the Building
Commissioner or Building Inspector to order the building
owner, or Town, to demolish a building at any time if it is
determined that the condition of a building or part thereof
[1]
(d)
(1)
§ 139-26 WETLANDS § 139-26
136:371
presents an imminent and substantial danger to the public
health or safety.
Repair. Nothing in this section shall restrict any authority
in the general laws for the Building Commissioner or
Building Inspector to require the applicant to take
reasonable action to prevent the need for required
demolition of a significant building, which may include
securing the building and making it safe so that it does not
present an imminent and substantial danger to the public.
[2]
Issuance of building, use, or occupancy permit.
If it has been determined that a building is subject to
review, pursuant to Subsection A(1)(b) above, no building
permits shall be issued for the erection of a new building
on the site of such building subject to review before
issuing a demolition permit for such building subject to
review in compliance with this section.
[1]
If it has been determined that a building subject to review
has been voluntarily demolished in violation of this
section, no building permits shall be issued for new
construction, or any use or occupancy permit for any use
other than a park or recreational open space, with respect
to the premises of such building for a period of two years
after the date of the determination. As used herein,
"premises" includes the parcel of land upon which the
demolished building was located and all abutting parcels
under common ownership or control.
[2]
The applicant (or the owner of record, if different from the
applicant) shall be responsible for properly securing the
building during the time that it is subject to review under
this section. If a building is subject to demolition delay,
pursuant to Subsection A(1)(b) above, and the applicant
fails to secure the building, the loss of the building to fire
or other causes shall be considered voluntary demolition
for the purposes of this section.
[3]
(e)
Procedure.
An application for review pursuant to this section shall
be made to the Building Commissioner in the manner
provided in this Subsection A(1)(f). If the applicant is not
the owner of record of the building, the owner or owners
of record shall co-sign the application.
[1]
The applicant (or building owner) is encouraged to apply
for review under this section as early as possible, so that
any necessary review, and any delay period required by
this section, may be completed prior to, or during, any
[2]
(f)
§ 139-26 NANTUCKET CODE § 139-26
136:372
other review to which the building or its site may be
subject.
Application for review under this section shall be made in
connection with an application for a demolition permit.
[3]
After its receipt of an application, pursuant to this
Subsection A(1)(f), the following determinations shall be
made:
Whether immediate demolition is required pursuant to
Subsection A(1)(d); and
[a]
Whether said structure has any residential reuse
potential pursuant to Subsection A(1)(c)[2].
[b]
[4]
A notice of determination shall be issued within 20 days
after the application filing date. If it is determined that
the structure does not require immediate demolition and
that it does have reuse potential the applicant shall place
a public notice in a local newspaper.

bylaw relating to nonconforming structures. Further, a use of land and/
or lots and construction of structures shall be exempt from this chapter

Preexisting, nonconforming structures or uses may be extended,
altered, or changed, provided that:
The special permit granting authority finds that such
extension, alteration, or change shall not be substantially more
detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure and/or
use to the neighborhood. Where an existing structure violates
a front, rear, or side yard setback distance, the special permit
granting authority may issue a special permit to allow an
extension, alteration, or change to the structure, provided that
the nonconforming setback distance is not made more
nonconforming and based upon a finding that the extension
will not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood
than the existing nonconformity; or
(a)

A.
§ 139-33 WETLANDS § 139-33
136:393
The Zoning Administrator or the special permit granting
authority finds that the alteration, extension, or change to
a structure does not increase its nonconforming nature and
does not create any new nonconformities. Where an existing
structure violates a front, rear, or side yard setback distance,
the Zoning Administrator may issue a permit allowing an
extension, alteration, or change to the structure, provided that
the nonconforming setback distance is not made more
nonconforming and no new nonconformities are created; or
(b)
A Zoning Enforcement Officer determines through a review of
the building permit application that the extension, alteration,
or change to any nonconforming structure is compliant with
all dimensional requirements of this chapter and does not
increase the nonconformity. [Amended 11-6-2017 STM by
Art. 19, AG approval 2-26-2018]
(c)
An extension, alteration, or change to an existing structure or a
new structure that will result in an increase in the pre-existing
nonconforming ground cover ratio of a lot may be allowed through
the issuance of a special permit, provided that the special permit
granting authority makes the following findings:
The increase in ground cover ratio will not be substantially
more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing
nonconformity;
(a)
The resulting ground cover ratio is consistent with the
character of the surrounding neighborhood; and
(b)
The extension, alteration, or change to the existing structure
or the new structure is conforming to other dimensional
requirements of this chapter.
(c)
(2)
Preexisting, nonconforming lots may be increased in area or
frontage through the addition of adjoining property without the
need for any relief under this bylaw. Any other alteration to a
preexisting, nonconforming lot that does not increase an existing or
create a new nonconformity is allowed upon determination by the
Zoning Administrator that such alteration will not be substantially
more detrimental to the neighborhood. Lots created pursuant to
MGL c. 41, § 81P, based upon the exception in the clause of MGL
c. 41, § 81L for lots containing two or more structures that predate
the adoption of subdivision control in the Town, shall have the
same status as preexisting, nonconforming lots, and any structures
thereon, which predate the adoption of subdivision control in the
Town, shall have the status of preexisting nonconforming
structures. The removal of structures to facilitate an alteration or
change to an existing structure, the relocation of the structure
upon the lot, or the construction of a new structure, shall not cause
(3)
§ 139-33 NANTUCKET CODE § 139-33
136:394
the lot to be merged with an abutting lot in common ownership,
provided that the lot remains vacant for less than one year.
Removal and reconstruction of any or all of the preexisting
nonconforming structure(s), or any portion(s) thereof, in excess of
the permitted ground cover ratio upon a lot, shall be allowed by
special permit, provided that:
Such special permit shall have been issued prior to the removal
of the preexisting nonconforming structure(s), or any
portion(s) thereof;
(a)
(b) (Reserved)
All reconstructed structure(s), or portion(s) thereof, shall
conform to all applicable front, rear and side yard setback
requirements; unless relief is granted under separate
provisions of this chapter; and
(c)
The special permit granting authority shall have made the
finding that the result of the proposed removal and
reconstruction shall not be substantially more detrimental to
the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming structure
and/or use.
(d)
(4)
Constructions or operations under a building permit, a site plan review,
or a special permit shall conform to any subsequent amendment of
this chapter: [Amended 4-14-1997 ATM by Art. 49, AG approval
8-5-1997]
Unless the use or construction is commenced within a period of not
more than six months after the issuance of the permit; and
(1)
In cases involving construction, unless such construction is
continued through to completion as continuously and expeditiously
as is reasonable.
(2)
B.
Nonconforming uses and structures abandoned or not used for a period
of three years shall not be reestablished.
Any future use or structure shall conform with the requirements of
this chapter.
(1)
C.
Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or use shall be
permitted to revert to a nonconforming use; provided, however, that:
An accessory building which is accessory to a residential use and
has no commercial use may be razed and reconstructed with
substantially the same configuration, ground cover, siting and use.
(1)
D.
Any increase in area, frontage, width, yard or depth requirements shall
not prohibit an unimproved lot, which at the time of recording or
endorsement of such lot, whichever occurred sooner, or at any time
E.
§ 139-33 WETLANDS § 139-33
136:395
thereafter, was not held in common ownership with any adjoining land
and conformed to then-existing Zoning Bylaw requirements, from being
built upon for a conforming use or for single- and two-family purposes
as provided by MGL c. 40A, § 6, as may be amended from time to
time. [Amended 5-5-1992 ATM by Art. 36, AG approval 8-3-1992;

5-7-2014]
In addition, any increase in area, frontage, width, yard or depth
requirements shall not prohibit an unimproved lot from being built
upon, provided that at the time of such amendment, the lot had the
benefit of a zoning protection period pursuant to MGL c. 40A, § 6 (5th
par.), was dimensionally compliant pursuant to such protection, and
was conveyed into separate ownership from adjoining land prior to the
end of such zoning protection, and remained in separate ownership
and control at all times since the expiration of such protection, and
now has less than the present requirements of area or frontage and
has a frontage of not less than 20 feet or the benefit of an appurtenant
easement providing a means of access for vehicles and utilities to
and from a public street, which access, in the opinion of the Planning
Board, has sufficient width, suitable grades, and adequate
construction to provide for the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to
the proposed construction and for the installation of municipal services
to serve the land in question and the buildings erected and to be
erected thereon.
For a lot within the provisions of this § 139-33E, the maximum
ground cover upon such lot shall be:
In the case of a lot containing less than 5,000 square feet, 30%
of the area of the lot or the amount determined in accordance
with the maximum ground cover ratio requirement for the
zoning district in which the lot is situated, whichever is
greater; or
(a)
In the case of a lot containing at least 5,000 square feet,
1,500 square feet of ground cover or the amount determined in
accordance with the maximum ground cover ratio requirement
for the zoning district in which the lot is situated, whichever is
greater. In the LUG-2 and LUG-3 Districts only, a lot containing
at least 40,000 square feet shall be permitted 2,000 square feet
of ground cover or the amount determined in accordance with
the maximum ground cover ratio requirement for the zoning
district in which the lot is situated, whichever is greater; and

Purpose. On November 8, 2016, the voters of the commonwealth
approved a law regulating the cultivation, processing, distribution,
possession and use of marijuana for recreational purposes (new MGL c.
94G, Regulation of the Use and Distribution of Marijuana Not Medically
Prescribed). The law, which allows certain personal use and possession
A.
§ 139-33 NANTUCKET CODE § 139-37
136:398
of marijuana, took effect on December 15, 2016 and (as amended on
December 30, 2016 by Chapter 351 of the Acts of 2016 and, thereafter,
on July 28, 2017 by Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2017) requires a Cannabis
Control Commission to issue regulations regarding the licensing of
commercial activities by March 15, 2018 and to begin accepting
applications for licenses no later than April 1, 2018. Regulations to
be promulgated by the Cannabis Control Commission may provide
guidance on certain aspects of local regulation of a non-medical
marijuana establishments (hereinafter, a "recreational marijuana
establishment," as defined in MGL c.94G, § 1) (hereinafter, a
"recreational marijuana establishment"). The regulation of recreational
marijuana raises novel legal, planning, and public safety issues, and the
Town needs time to study and consider the regulation of recreational
marijuana establishments and address such issues, as well as to
address the potential impact of the state regulations on local zoning
and to undertake a planning process to consider amending the Zoning
Bylaw regarding regulation of recreational marijuana establishments.
The Town intends to adopt a temporary moratorium on the use of land
and structures in the Town for recreational marijuana establishments
so as to allow sufficient time to address the effects of such structures
and uses in the Town and to enact bylaws in a consistent manner.
Definition.
RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENT — A marijuana
cultivator, independent testing laboratory, marijuana product
manufacturer, marijuana retailer or any other type of licensed
marijuana-related business.
B.
Temporary moratorium. For the reasons set forth above and
notwithstanding any other provision of the Zoning Bylaw to the
contrary, the Town hereby adopts a temporary moratorium on the use
of land or structures for a recreational marijuana establishment and
other uses related to recreational marijuana. The moratorium shall be
in effect through December 31, 2018. During the moratorium period,
the Town shall undertake a planning process to address the potential
impacts of recreational marijuana in the Town, and to consider the
Cannabis Control Commission regulations regarding recreational
marijuana establishments, and shall consider adopting new Zoning
Bylaws in response to these new issues.

agricultural land for the production of food, and other agricultural products,
and also for its natural and ecological value. This disclosure notification is
to inform buyers or occupants that the property they are about to acquire
or occupy lies within a town where farming activities occur. Such farming
activities may include, but are not limited to, activities that cause noise,
dust and odors. Buyers or occupants are also informed that the location
of property within the Town may be impacted by commercial agricultural
operations, including the ability to access water services for such property
under certain circumstances." In addition to the above, a copy of said
disclosure notification shall be posted on the Town of Nantucket's website

the Board of Selectmen, the Zoning Enforcement Officer, or the Board
of Health, depending upon the nature of the grievance. A copy of any
grievance shall be submitted to the above-named board and officer
regardless of the entity to which it was originally submitted. The filing of
the grievance does not suspend the time within which to pursue any other
available remedies that the aggrieved may have. The Zoning Enforcement
Officer or Board of Selectmen shall forward a copy of the grievance to the
Agricultural Commission or its agent, which shall review and facilitate the
resolution of the grievance, and report its recommendations to the referring
Town authority within an agreed-upon time frame. The Board of Health,
except in cases of imminent danger or public health risk, shall forward a
copy of the grievance to the Agricultural Commission or its agent, which
shall review and facilitate the resolution of the grievance, and report its

discontinue the same, and may regulate the use of such water and fix and
collect rates to be paid for the use of the same.
SECTION 2. Said town, for the purposes aforesaid, is hereby authorized
to acquire by purchase or take by eminent domain under Chapter 79 of
the General Laws the entire water rights, estates, franchises and privileges
of any corporation supplying water to its inhabitants and thereby become
entitled to all its rights and privileges and subject to all its duties and
liabilities; and may lease, or take by eminent domain under said Chapter
79, or acquire by purchase or otherwise, and hold, the waters, or any
portion thereof, of any pond, brook or stream or of any groundwater sources
by means of driven or other wells or filter galleries, within the town,
and the water rights and water sources connected therewith; provided
that the amount of water which may be taken shall from time to time be
determined by vote of the town; and also may take by eminent domain
under said Chapter 79, or acquire by purchase or otherwise, and hold,
all lands, rights-of-way and easements necessary for collecting, storing,
purifying and preserving such water and for conveying the same to any
part of said district; provided that no source of water supply and no lands
necessary for preserving the quality of the water shall be taken without
first obtaining the advice and approval of the Department of Public Health,
and that the location of all dams, reservoirs, wells or filter galleries to
be used as sources of water supply under this Act shall be subject to
the approval of said Department. Said town may construct and may erect

reservoirs, buildings, standpipes, fixtures and other structures and may
make excavations, procure and operate machinery and provide such other
means and appliances and do such other things as may be necessary for the

for that purpose, may construct wells and reservoirs, establish pumping
works and lay down and maintain conduits, pipes and other works, under
or over any lands, watercourses, railroads or public or private ways and

obstruct the same; and for the purpose of constructing, laying, maintaining,
§ A301-2 WETLANDS § A301-2
136:437
operating and repairing such conduits, pipes and other works, and for all
other proper purposes of this Act, said town may dig up or raise and embank

least hinderance to public travel thereon. Said town shall not enter upon,
construct or lay any conduits, pipes or other works within the location of
any railroad corporation except at such time and in such manner as it may
agree upon with such corporation or in case of failure so to agree as may be

improved and controlled by the Board of Water Commissioners hereinafter
provided for, in such manner as it shall deem for the best interest of the
town.

action of said town or Board under this Act may recover damages from said

expenses and liabilities incurred or to be incurred under the provisions of
this Act, issue from time to time bonds or notes to an amount not exceeding
the limit authorized by Section 8 of Chapter 44 of the General Laws which
shall bear on their face the words "Town of Nantucket Water Loan, Act
of 1963." Each authorized issue shall constitute a separate loan, and such
loans shall be payable as provided for in said Chapter 44.
SECTION 6. Said town shall, at the time of authorizing said loan or loans,
provide for the payment thereof in accordance with the provisions of
Section 5, and when a vote to that effect has been passed, a sum which,
with the income derived from the water rates, will be sufficient to pay the
annual expense of operating the waterworks and the interest as it accrues
on the bonds or notes issued as aforesaid and to make such payments on the
principal as may be required under the provisions of this Act shall, without
further vote, be assessed by the Assessors of the town annually thereafter
in the same manner as other taxes, until the debt incurred by the said loan
or loans is extinguished.
SECTION 7. Whoever willfully or wantonly corrupts, pollutes or diverts any
of the waters taken or held under this Act or injures any structure, work or
other property owned, held or used by said town under the authority and
for the purposes of this Act shall forfeit and pay to said town three times the
amount of damages assessed therefor, to be recovered in an action of tort,
and, upon conviction of any one (1) of the above willful or wanton acts, shall
be punished by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars ($300.) or by
imprisonment for not more than one (1) year.
SECTION 8. Said town shall, after its acceptance of this Act, at the same

so appointed shall hold office until the town fills the vacancy in the manner
specified herein.
SECTION 9. Said Commissioners shall fix just and equitable prices and
rates for the use of water and shall prescribe the time and manner of
payment. The income of the waterworks shall be applied to defraying all
operating expenses, interest charges and payments on the principal as they
accrue upon any bonds or notes issued under authority of this Act. If there
should be a net surplus remaining after providing for the aforesaid charges,
it shall be used for such new construction as the Water Commissioners may
determine upon, and, in case of a surplus should remain after payment for
such new construction, the water rates shall be reduced proportionately. No
money shall be expended in new construction by the Water Commissioners
except from the net surplus aforesaid unless the town appropriates and

in writing, and it may make recommendations to the applicant with respect

certificate of applicability or a certificate of nonapplicability; for any person
to raze any building or structure without having first obtained from the
Commission a permit for such razing; for any person to construct or alter

fraudulent or misleading information to the Commission in connection with
any application.
SECTION 11. Appeals may be taken to the Board of Selectmen by any
person aggrieved by the ruling of the Historic District Commission. The
Board of Selectmen shall hear and act upon such appeals promptly, and
the decision of the Board shall be as determined by a majority vote of the
members of the Board. Such appeals shall be taken within ten (10) days
of the filing by the Commission of its certificate of determination with the
Clerk of the Town of Nantucket, and written notice of such appeal shall be
given by the appealing party to the Commission at the time such appeal is
taken.
SECTION 12. Any person or the Historic District Commission, aggrieved
by a decision of the Board of Selectmen, may appeal to the Superior Court
§ A301-4 NANTUCKET CODE § A301-4

sitting in equity for the County of Nantucket, provided that such appeal
is filed in said Court within 15 days after such decision is recorded. The
appealing party or parties shall, at the time of filing such appeal, give
notice thereof to all persons who were parties to the appeal to the Board
of Selectmen, by causing to be delivered to such parties a copy of the
complaint and written notice of the filing thereof. The Court shall hear
all pertinent evidence and determine the facts and, upon the facts so
determined, annul such decision if found to exceed the authority of such
Board, or may remand the case for further action by the Commission or
make such other decree as justice and equity may require. The foregoing
remedy shall be exclusive, but the parties shall have all rights of appeal and
exception as in other equity cases.
Costs shall not be allowed against the Historic District Commission or the
Board of Selectmen unless it shall appear to the Court that the Commission
or the Board, in making the decision appealed from, acted with gross
negligence, in bad faith or with malice.
Costs shall not be allowed against the party appealing from the decision of
the Historic District Commission or the Board of Selectmen unless it shall

to provide reserves for debt service and other expenses; to pay consulting,
appraisal, advisory and legal fees and costs incidental to the issuance and
sale of such bonds or notes; to purchase, refund or renew bonds or notes

provisions for the payment of interest and all other details thereof and to
provide for their sale and issuance at such price and in such manner as
the Commission shall determine, subject only to any limitations set forth
in this Act. Unless the Town of Nantucket shall have authorized by a twothirds
vote of a Town Meeting the pledging of the full faith and credit of

or notes of the land bank, all bonds or notes issued hereunder shall be
payable solely from the fees and other revenues of the land bank pledged to
their payment and shall not be deemed a pledge of the full faith and credit
of the Town or County of Nantucket, the commonwealth or any political
subdivision therein.
The Commission may enter into any agreements, including, without
limitation, a loan agreement and a trust agreement necessary to effectuate
and to secure any bonds or notes issued by the land bank. Such agreements
may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues and other money
held or to be received by the land bank. Such agreements may contain such
provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security and remedies
of the holders of such bonds or notes, including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, provisions defining defaults and providing for
remedies in the event thereof which may include the acceleration of
maturities and covenants setting forth the duties of and limitations on
the land bank in relation to the custody, safeguarding, investment and
application of money, the issuance of additional debt obligations, the use of
any surplus proceeds of the borrowing, including any investment earnings
thereon, and establishment of special funds and reserves.
The pledge of any such agreement shall be valid and binding and shall be
deemed continuously perfected for the purposes of the Uniform Commercial
Code from the time when the pledge is made; the revenues, money, rights
and proceeds so pledged and then held or thereafter acquired or received
by the land bank shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge
without any physical delivery or segregation thereof or further act; and the
lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties having
claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the town or county,
irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. No document by

the land bank, and no filing need by made under the Uniform Commercial
Code.
The trustee, with respect to any such trust agreement entered into pursuant
to this section, shall be a trust company or a bank having the powers
of a trust company within the commonwealth. Any such trust agreement
§ A301-9 WETLANDS § A301-9
136:455
may provide that any money received thereunder may be held, deposited
or invested by the trustee, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8,
pending the disbursement thereof, in any deposits or investments which
are lawful for the funds of savings banks and shall provide that any officer
with whom or any bank or trust company with which such money shall be
deposited shall act as trustee of such money and shall hold and apply the
same for the purposes hereof and thereof, subject to such regulation or
limitation as this Act or such trust agreement may provide.
It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company within the commonwealth
to act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or notes, revenues or other
money hereunder and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge
such security, if any, as may be required by the Commission. Any trust
agreement entered into pursuant to this section may set forth the rights and
remedies of the holders of any bonds or notes and of the trustee and may
restrict the individual rights of action by any such holders. In addition to the
foregoing, any such trust agreement may contain such other provisions as
the Commission may deem reasonable and proper. All expenses incurred in
carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement may be treated as part
of the cost of operation of the land bank and paid from the revenues or other
funds pledged or assigned to the payment of the principal of the premium, if
any, and interest on the bonds or notes or from any other funds available to
the land bank. In addition to other security provided herein or otherwise by
law, bonds or notes issued under this section may be secured, in whole or
in part, by insurance or by letters or lines of credit or other credit facilities
issued to the land bank by any bank, trust company or other financial
institution, within or without the commonwealth, and the land bank may
pledge or assign any of its revenues as security for the reimbursement by
the land bank to the issuers of such letters or lines of credit, insurance or
credit facilities of any payments made thereunder.
St. 1984, Ch. 407, § 2.
SECTION 4C. If at any time any principal or interest is due or about to
come due on any bonds or notes of the land bank to secure which the full
faith and credit of the Town of Nantucket or Nantucket County shall have
been pledged and funds to pay the same are not available, the Commission
shall certify to the Town Treasurer and Selectmen of the town or to the
County Treasurer and County Commissioners of the county, as appropriate,
the amount required to meet such obligations, and the Town Treasurer or
the County Treasurer shall thereupon pay over to the land bank the amount
so certified from any funds in the treasury. For the purpose of providing
or restoring to the treasury the sums so paid over to the land bank, the
Town Treasurer, with the approval of the Selectmen, is authorized to incur
debt outside the Town's debt limit and issue notes therefor for a period not
exceeding two (2) years and to renew or refund the same from time to time
until the town shall have received from the land bank sufficient funds to
repay such notes and the interest thereon in full. Whenever the town or the
county shall have been required to pay over any sums of money to the land
bank under this section, the land bank shall be precluded from acquiring
§ A301-9 NANTUCKET CODE § A301-9
136:456
any additional property or issuing any of its bonds or notes for purposes
other than repaying the town, until the land bank shall have repaid the town
in full for all sums paid to the land bank hereunder, including interest on
any notes issued for such purpose, unless the town shall have appropriated
sufficient funds for such purpose at a Town Meeting.
St. 1984, Ch. 407, § 2.
SECTION 4D. Bonds and notes issued under the provisions of this Act are
hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the
commonwealth and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, trust
companies in their commercial departments, savings banks, cooperative
banks, banking associations, investment companies, executors,
administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries may properly and legally
invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such
bonds and notes are hereby made securities which may properly and legally
be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any
agency or political subdivision of the commonwealth for any purpose for
which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the commonwealth is now or
may hereafter be authorized by law.

recitals in any bonds or notes issued under this Act, all such bonds and
notes shall be deemed to be investment securities under the Uniform
Commercial Code.

SECTION 4F. Bonds and notes may be issued under this Act without
obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board,
bureau or agency of the Town or County of Nantucket, except that the
full faith and credit of the Town or County of Nantucket shall not be
pledged for the payment of such bonds or notes unless such pledge shall
have been authorized by a two-thirds vote as provided in Section 4, and
without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or
things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically
required therefor by this Act. The validity of and security for any bonds

or nonexistence of any such consent or other proceedings, conditions or
things.

St. 1983, Ch. 669, § 9. Amended by St. 1995, Ch. 309,97 § 1.
SECTION 10. There is hereby imposed a fee equal to two percent (2%) of
the purchase price upon the transfer of any real property interest in any real
property situated in Nantucket County. Said fee shall be the liability of the
purchaser of such real property interest, and any agreement between the
purchaser and the seller or any other person with reference to the allocation
of the responsibility for bearing said fee shall not affect such liability of the
purchaser. The fee shall be paid to the Commission or its designee and shall
be accompanied by a copy of the deed or other instrument evidencing such
transfer, if any, and an affidavit signed under oath or under the pains and
penalties of perjury by the purchaser or his legal representative, attesting
to the true and complete purchase price and the basis, if any, upon which
the transfer is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part from the fee imposed
hereby. The Commission or its designee shall promptly thereafter execute
and issue a certificate indicating that the appropriate fee has been paid or
that the transfer is exempt from the fee, stating the basis for the exemption.
The Register of Deeds for Nantucket County and the Assistant Recorder for
the Registry District of Nantucket County shall not record or register or
receive or accept for recording or registration any deed, except a mortgage
deed, to which has not been affixed such a certificate executed by the
Commission or its designee. Failure to comply with this requirement shall
not affect the validity of any instrument. The Commission shall deposit all
fees received hereunder with the County Treasurer of Nantucket County as
a part of the fund established by Section 8. The fee imposed hereunder shall
be due simultaneously with the time of transfer of the transfer upon which it
is imposed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever there is a conveyance
of real property interests and a conveyance of personalty related thereto at
or about the same time, the allocations of payments between real estate and
personalty agreed to by the purchaser and seller shall not determine the
amount of the fee due pursuant to this section; instead, the Commission may

SECTION 11. At any time within seven (7) days following the issuance of
the certificate of payment of the fee imposed by Section 10, the purchaser
or his legal representative may return said certificate to the Commission
or its designee for cancellation, together with an affidavit signed under
oath or under the pains and penalties of perjury that the transfer, with
respect to which such certificate was issued, has not been consummated,
and thereupon the fee paid with respect to such transfer shall be forthwith
returned to the purchaser or his legal representative.
St. 1983, Ch. 669, § 11.
SECTION 12. The following transfers of real property interests shall be
exempt from the fee established by Section 10. Except as otherwise
provided, the purchaser shall have the burden of proof that any transfer is
exempt hereunder. Any otherwise exempt transfer shall not be exempt in
the event that such transfer, by itself or as part of a series of transfers, was
made for the primary purpose of evading the fee imposed by section 10.
(a) Transfers to the government of the United States, the commonwealth
and any of its' instrumentalities, agencies or subdivisions.
(b) Transfers which, without additional consideration, confirm, correct,
modify or supplement a transfer previously made.
(c) Transfers made as gifts without consideration. In any proceeds to
determine the amount of any fee due hereunder, it shall be presumed that
any transfer for consideration of less than fair market value of the real
property interests transferred was made as a gift without consideration
to the extent of the difference between the fair market value of the real
property interests and the amount of consideration claimed by the
purchaser to have been paid or transferred, if the purchaser shall have
been at the time of transfer the spouse, the lineal descendant or the lineal
ancestor of the seller, by blood or adoption, and otherwise it shall be
presumed that consideration was paid in an amount equal to the fair market
value of the real property interests transferred, at the time of transfer.
(d) Transfer to the trustees of a trust in exchange for a beneficial interest
received by the seller in such trust; distributions by the trustees of a trust
to the beneficiaries of such trust.

property interests so transferred will be held by the charitable or religious
organization solely for its public charitable or religious purposes.
(h) Transfers to a mortgagee in foreclosure of the mortgage held by such
mortgagee, and transfers of the property subject to a mortgage to the
mortgagee in consideration of the forbearance of the mortgagee from

company at the time of its formation, pursuant to which transfer no gain
or loss is recognized under the provisions of Section 351 or Section 721
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; provided, however,
that such transfer shall be exempt only in the event that (i) with respect
to a corporation, the transferor retains an interest in the newly formed
corporation which is equivalent to the interest the transferor held prior to
the transfer, or (ii) with respect to a partnership or limited liability company,
the transferor retains after such formation rights in capital interests and
profit interests within such partnership or limited liability company which
are equivalent to the interest the transferor held prior to the transfer.
(j) Transfers made to a stockholder of a corporation in liquidation or partial
liquidation of the corporation, and transfers made to a partner of a
partnership or to a member of a limited liability company in dissolution
or partial dissolution of the partnership or limited liability company; but
the transfer shall be exempt only if (i) with respect to a corporation, the
transferee receives property, including real property interests and other
property received, which is the same fraction of the total property of the
transferor corporation as the fraction of the corporation's stock owned by
the transferee prior to the transfer, or (ii) with respect to a partnership or
limited liability company, the transferee receives property, including real
property interests and other property received, which is the same fraction
of the property of the partnership or limited liability company as the fraction
of the capital and profit interests in the transferor formerly owned by the
transferee.
(k) Transfers consisting of the division of marital assets under the provisions
of MGL C. 208, § 34 or other provisions of law.
(l) Transfers of property consisting in part of real property interests situated

§ A301-9 NANTUCKET CODE § A301-9
136:462
of the claim of exemption and manner of allocation of the consideration for
such transfers.
(m) An amount determined on or before January 1 of each year by the land
bank commission after due analysis of the range of real estate prices and

to a purchaser who, or whose spouse at the time of transfer, has at no
time before the said transfer owned or possessed any real property interest

purchaser shall make the real property interest which is the subject of the
transfer the purchaser's actual domicile within 1 year of the time of transfer,

certain purpose to return to a former place of abode. In the event of a
later transfer within 5 years of the transfer exempted from the fee under
this paragraph, other than the transfer of a mortgage to an institutional

interest and penalties, and in addition to any fee otherwise due as a result
of the later transfer. The purchaser shall certify as to the foregoing, and
the Commission shall attach to the deed a certificate which shall recite the

with an affordable housing restriction; provided, however, that the
affordable housing restriction has a term remaining at the time of the
transfer of not less than five years; and provided further, that the purchaser
shall make the real property interest, that is the subject of the transfer,
the purchaser's actual domicile within two years of the time of transfer and
shall remain permanently or for an indefinite time and without any certain
purpose to return to a former place of abode for a period lasting not less
than the fifth anniversary of the transfer. Notwithstanding this paragraph, if
the real property interest is transferred again within five years and the later
transfer complies with this paragraph, a fee, interest or penalty shall not be
due. If the holder of an affordable housing restriction determines within five
years of the transfer that the real property interest to which it pertains is
not being used consistent with the requirements of the affordable housing
restriction or if a later transfer within five years that does not comply with
this paragraph, the fee exempted hereunder shall become due, together
with the accumulated interest and penalties calculated from the date of
the transfer exempted hereunder. The purchaser shall certify as to the
foregoing and the commission shall attach to the deed a certificate that

SECTION 13. A purchaser who fails to pay all or any portion of the fee
established by Section 10 on before the time when the same is due shall be
liable for the following additional payments in addition to said fee:
(a) Interest: The purchaser shall pay interest on the unpaid amount of the
fee to be calculated from the time of transfer at a rate equal to fourteen
percent (14%) per annum.
(b) Penalties: Any person who, without fraud or willful intent to defeat or

five percent (5%) of the outstanding fee as determined by the Commission
for each month or portion thereof thereafter that the fee is not paid in full;
provided, however, that in no event shall the amount of any penalty imposed

or evade the fee imposed by this chapter, a penalty equal to the amount of
said fee as determined by the Commission shall be paid by the purchaser in
addition to said fee.
St. 1983, Ch. 669, § 13.

controlling interest in such corporation after such formation, or (ii), with respect to a
partnership, the transferor retains after such formation rights to capital interests in
excess of fifty percent (50%) of the capital interests within such partnership or retains
rights to profit interests within such partnership in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the
total profit interests within such partnership."

shall grant a hearing on the matter of the imposition of said fee or of
any penalty or interest assessed, if a petition requesting such hearing is
received by the Commission within thirty (30) days after the mailing of said
notice. The Commission shall notify the purchaser in writing by registered
or certified mail of its determination concerning the deficiency, penalty or
interest within fifteen (15) days after said hearing. Any party aggrieved
by a determination of the Commission concerning a deficiency, penalty or
interest may, after payment of said deficiency, appeal to the District or
Superior Court within three (3) months after the mailing of notification of
the determination of the Commission. Upon the failure to timely petition for
a hearing or appeal to said Courts within the time limits hereby established,
the purchaser shall be bound by the terms of the notification, assessment
or determination, as the case may be, and shall be barred from contesting
the fee and any interest and penalty, as determined by the Commission.
All decisions of said Courts shall be appealable. Every notice to be given
under this section by the Commission shall be effective if mailed by certified
or registered mail to the purchaser at the address stated in a recorded or
registered instrument by virtue of which the purchaser holds any interest in
land, the transfer of which gives rise to the fee which is the subject of such
notice; and if no such address is stated or if such transfer is not evidenced
by an instrument recorded or registered in the public records in Nantucket
County, such notice shall be effective when so mailed to the purchaser in
care of any person appearing of record to have a fee interest in such land,
at the address of such person as set forth in an instrument recorded or
registered in Nantucket County.
(b) All fees, penalties and interest required to be paid pursuant to this
chapter shall constitute a personal debt of the purchaser and may be
recovered in an action of contract or in any other appropriate action, suit
or proceeding brought by the Commission; said action, suit or proceeding
shall be subject to the provisions of MGL C. 206.
(c) If any purchaser liable to pay the fee established by this Act neglects
or refuses to pay the same, the amount, including any interest and penalty
thereon, shall be a lien in favor of the Commission upon all property and
rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such purchaser.
Said lien shall arise at the time of transfer and shall continue until the
liability for such amount is satisfied. Said lien shall in any event terminate
not later than six (6) years following the time of transfer. Said lien shall not
be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser or judgment creditor
unless notice thereof has been filed by the Commission (a) with respect to
real property or fixtures in the registry of deeds for Nantucket County, or
(b) with respect to personal property, in the office in which a security or
financing statement or notice with respect to the property would be filed in
order to perfect a nonpossessory security interest belonging to the person
named in the relevant notice, subject to the same limitations as set forth in
MGL C. 62C, § 50.
In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay any fee,
interest or penalties imposed by this act, whether or not levy has been
§ A301-9 WETLANDS § A301-9
136:465
made, the Commission, in addition to other modes of relief, may direct a
civil action to be filed in a District or Superior Court of the Commonwealth
to enforce the lien of the Commission under this section with respect
to such liability or to subject any property of whatever nature of the
delinquent, or in which he has any right, title or interest, to the payment of
such liability.
The Commission may issue a waiver or release of any lien imposed by this
section. Such waiver or release shall be conclusive evidence that the lien
upon the property covered by the waiver or release is extinguished.
(d) If the commission has determined that a fee is due by asserting the
application of the evasion of fee doctrine described in section 12, then the
transferee shall have the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing
evidence as determined by the commission that the transfer, or series of
transfers, possessed both: (i) a valid, good faith business purpose other than
avoidance of the fee set forth in section 10 and (ii) economic substance
apart from the asserted fee avoidance benefit. In all such cases, the
transferee shall also have the burden of demonstrating by clear and
convincing evidence as determined by the commission that the asserted
non-fee-avoidance business purpose is commensurate with the amount of
the fee pursuant to section 10 to be thereby avoided.

THE TOWN OF NANTUCKET.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court
assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:
SECTION 1. The general court finds that there is a housing crisis on
Nantucket Island arising from the housing demand created by seasonal
visitors purchasing or renting housing in competition with the demand
created by seasonal employees, which competition then adversely affects
the ability of current or prospective residents to obtain housing.
SECTION 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law
to the contrary, the town of Nantucket may adopt by-laws to designate
the Nantucket Housing Authority as the agency authorized to create,
administer and enforce Nantucket housing needs covenants. These
covenants shall run with the land for a specified number of years or if no
termination date is specified then in perpetuity, and shall be executed by or
on behalf of the owner of the land appropriate to (a) limiting the use of all
or part of the land to occupancy by persons or families of middle income in
either rental or other housing, (b) restricting the resale price of all or part
of the property in order to ensure its affordability by future middle income
purchasers, or (c) in any way limiting or restricting the use or enjoyment of
all or any portion of the land for the purpose of encouraging or ensuring the
creation or retention of rental and other housing for occupancy by middle
income persons and families.
SECTION 3. For purposes of this act, "middle income persons and
households" shall mean persons and households earning less than 150
per cent of Nantucket county median household income as reported from
time to time by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
SECTION 4. This act shall take effect upon its passage.

SECTION 1. The town of Nantucket, acting by and through the Nantucket
sewer commission described in section 3, may lay out, plan, construct,
maintain and operate a system or systems of common sewers for a part or

by adoption by town meeting of one or more by-laws as a designated sewer
district under the jurisdiction and control of the sewer commission, with
such capacity limitations, connections, pumping stations, treatment plants
and other works, as may be allocated in such by-law to such sewer district
as required for a system or systems of sewage treatment and disposal, and
§ A301-11 NANTUCKET CODE § A301-12
136:468
may construct such sewers and related works in said sewer districts defined
and established by by-law as may be necessary. No other sewers shall be

control of the sewer commission.
SECTION 2. The town may make and maintain, within sewer districts
defined and established as set forth in section 1 in any way therein where
common sewers are constructed, such connecting sewers within the limits
of such way as may be necessary to connect any estate which abuts upon
the way within such district.
SECTION 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 169 of the acts of
1965, the town may, at any town meeting, by a two-thirds vote, vote that
the board of selectmen shall act as a Nantucket sewer commission, or that
there shall be a separate Nantucket sewer commission, the members of
which shall be appointed by the board of selectmen or elected by popular
vote for 3 year terms. The number, constitution and the choice of elected
or appointed commissioners of a separate sewer commission shall also be
determined by a two-thirds vote of town meeting. If a separate Nantucket
sewer commission is established by town meeting, any selectman shall be
eligible to serve as a member thereof. Town meeting shall be authorized
to change the method of establishment of the Nantucket sewer commission
described herein without any limitation on the number of times such
commission may be established or re-established as the case may be, by

appears in this act, such phrase shall include within its meaning either
the board of selectmen acting as Nantucket sewer commissioners, or the

and management of the systems operation and maintenance, and shall
be responsible for the good order of all sewers, pipes, pumping stations,

the town of Nantucket unless changed or modified pursuant to said charter.
SECTION 5. The board of selectmen acting for and on behalf of the town
of Nantucket, after being duly authorized to do so by town meeting, may
take by eminent domain pursuant to chapter 79 of the General Laws or
otherwise may, utilizing the procedures described in the charter of the
town of Nantucket acquire by purchase or gift any lands, rights-of-way, or
easements, public or private, in the town necessary for accomplishing any
purpose mentioned in this act and may construct such sewers under or over
any state road, any bridge, pier, tidelands, boulevards or other public way,
or within the location of any state land, without the necessity for any formal
filings in the registry of deeds, and may enter upon and dig up any private
§ A301-12 WETLANDS § A301-12
136:469
land or any public land or public way, for the purpose of laying such sewers
and of maintaining and repairing the same, and may do any other thing
proper or necessary for the purposes of this act.
SECTION 6. The financial operations of the sewer system shall be an

fund shall be only upon authorization of the Nantucket sewer commission.
The town shall, by vote at town meeting, determine whether it shall pay
the whole or a portion of the cost of said system or systems of sewerage
and sewage disposal, and if a portion, what proportion. If the town votes to

portion of the cost of said system or systems, the town, acting through
the Nantucket sewer commission, may avail itself of any or all of the
methods permitted by the General Laws; and the provisions of the General
Laws relative to the assessment, apportionment, division, reassessment,
abatement and collection of sewer assessments or the additional methods
set forth in section 8, and as to liens therefor and to interest thereon, shall
apply to assessments made pursuant to this act by the Nantucket sewer
commission, except that interest shall be at the rate as may be established
by the Nantucket sewer commission from time to time.
At the same meeting at which town meeting determines that any portion of
the cost is to be borne by the town, it may by vote determine by which of
such methods the remaining portion of said cost shall be provided for.
The collector of taxes of said town shall certify the payment or payments of
any such assessment or apportionments thereof to the sewer commission or
to the selectmen acting as such, who shall preserve a record thereof.
SECTION 7. The revenues received by the fund described in section 6
of this act from sewer assessments, fees, charges, contributions from the
town towards the costs of such sewer system as described in section 6,
and the like as receipts or revenues, shall be applied to the payment of
charges and expenses incident to the design, construction, maintenance,
and operation of said system or systems of sewerage and sewage disposal
or to the extensions thereof, to the payment of principal or interest upon
bonds or notes issued for sewer purposes, or to the payment or redemption
of such bonds or notes.
SECTION 8. The Nantucket sewer commission may, in its discretion,
prescribe for the users of said sewer systems and disposal works such
annual charges, connection fees, assessments, privilege fees, and the like,
based on the benefits derived therefrom as such sewer commission may
deem proper, subject however, to such by-laws as may be adopted by vote of
the town, or as may be provided for in the General Laws. Notwithstanding
any law to the contrary, the commission is authorized to impose and collect
such charges, fees, or assessments prior to connection or operation of such
system of sewers, and may enter into agreements for the payment thereof
over such time as the sewer commission shall determine. In fixing the
charges to be imposed for said system, the Nantucket sewer commission
§ A301-12 NANTUCKET CODE § A301-12

include, in setting privilege fees, capital costs and interest charges

a capacity utilization fee to new estates and properties added to a sewer
district authorized by this act from outside a designated needs area in
addition to any privilege fee; may charge betterments, special assessments,

system improvements and extensions to pay for all costs for sewer line
extensions to serve new connections, both within the sewer districts
authorized by the act and in any areas added to such sewer district; and
may impose such charges on properties within a sewer district authorized
by the act whether or not such estates and properties are then connected to
the sewer system.
SECTION 9. The Nantucket sewer commission may, from time to time,
adopt and prescribe rules and regulations for the means of connection of
estates and buildings with sewers and for inspection of the materials, the
construction, alteration, and use of all connections entering to such sewers,
but not including the expansion of districts except as provided in sections 1
and 10, and may prescribe penalties, not exceeding $300 for the violation of
any such rule or regulation. Such rules and regulations shall be available for
public review at the sewer commission's designated office during regular
office hours. Any changes, deletions, additions or revisions to said rules
and regulations deemed necessary by the Nantucket sewer commission
from time to time, shall take full effect after a notice of change has been
published at least once a week for 2 successive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation in the town of Nantucket, which notice shall detail
where and when such revised rules and regulations may be viewed by the
general public.
SECTION 10. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, owners
of land not within the sewer districts defined and established pursuant to
section 1 of this act shall not be permitted to connect to the town's sewer
system except as is set forth in this act. The territory covered by said sewer
districts may be amended from time to time by the board having charge
of sewers, after a public hearing conducted to consider such amendment,
upon approval of the department of environmental protection if otherwise
required by law and upon enactment by town meeting of a by-law defining
or establishing a new or expanded sewer district. In the event that the
board having charge of sewers votes not to amend the territory of any sewer
district in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the amendment may
nevertheless be enacted in a form of a by-law upon a two-thirds vote of town
meeting.

Nantucket by this act may include authorization to the Nantucket sewer
commission without a town meeting vote to add to the sewer districts

ARTICLE III
Executive Functions
Section 3.1. Executive Powers
The executive powers of the County shall be vested in the County
Administrator who shall, with the assistance of the various County
Department heads, be responsible for the enforcement of this Charter, the
County's legislative actions pursuant to Article II, and any General Laws
applicable thereto.
It is the intent of Article II of this Charter to confer on the five members who
perform the legislative functions of County Commissioners broad general
legislative and investigative powers as are germane to the exercise of their
legislative powers, but at the same time, by virtue of Article III, to retain
to the Executive Branch of County government full control over County
administration and of the administration of County services provided for in
this Charter. Accordingly, this Charter seeks to establish clear lines between
Article II legislative and Article III executive functions as follows: the five
members who perform the legislative functions are to deal with individual
Article III County employees only through the executive officials responsible
for the overall executive management of the County's affairs as specified
in this Article III. All routine contact with Article III County employees, all
actions and communications concerning the administration of the County's
government and provisions of services shall be from the legislative branch
to and through the County's executive officials.
Nothing in the foregoing nor in this Charter shall be construed to prohibit
informal, non-directive conversations of County Commissioners with County
officials, nor the inquiry by the legislative branch into any act or problem of
County administration. Any of the five members who perform the functions
of County Commissioners may require a report on any aspect of the
government of the County at any time by making a request therefor to the
County Administrator. The five members may, by majority vote, require the
County Administrator to appear before them sitting as a committee of the
whole and to bring before them such records and reports and such officials
and employees of the County as the five members shall deem necessary
to insure clarification of any legislative matter under study. The five may
further vote to establish any number of its members as an ad hoc committee
to consult with the executive branch to study any matter and to report
thereon.
Section 3.2. County Administrator
Unless the five members who perform the functions of County
Commissioners vote to appoint another; the County Administrator shall be
the person then serving as Nantucket Town Administrator or Executive
Secretary. The person so appointed shall, by education, experience and
ability, be qualified to perform the duties established for the position. Such

AMENDED THROUGH DECEMBER 20, 1999
NANTUCKET PLANNING BOARD
RULES AND REGULATIONS
GOVERNING THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND
Nantucket, Massachusetts
Prepared by the Nantucket Planning Board.
Under the authority vested in the Planning Board of the Town of Nantucket by Section 81-Q of
Chapter 41 of the General Laws of Massachusetts, the Planning Board called a public hearing in the
Town of Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Monday, December 20, 1999, for the purpose of soliciting
public comment concerning amendments to its Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of

These rules and regulations have been based on the Model Subdivision Regulations of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, but have been considerably revised by the Nantucket Planning
Board to suit local conditions. On December 20, 1999, the Planning Board voted affirmatively to
approve the contents of this edition of the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of
Land.

SECTION I
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.01 ADOPTION AND EFFECTIVE DATE
The Subdivision Control Law of Massachusetts (Sections 81K through 81GG inclusive, of
Chapter 41 of the General Laws of the Commonwealth) is in effect in the Town of Nantucket,
having been adopted on February 16, 1955. Under authority vested in the Nantucket Planning
Board by Section 81Q of Chapter 41, the Board hereby adopts these rules and regulations
governing the subdivision of land, which shall be effective on and after the 20th day of
December, 1999, until modified or amended by the Board.
1.02 APPLICABILITY
No person shall make a subdivision of any land within the Town, or proceed with the
improvement or sale of lots in a subdivision, or the construction of ways, or the installation of
municipal services therein, unless and until a definitive plan of such subdivision has been
submitted to and approved by the Board, as hereinafter provided.
1.03 PURPOSE
These regulations have been adopted for the purpose of protecting the safety, convenience and
welfare of the inhabitants of Nantucket by regulating the laying out and construction of ways in
subdivisions providing access to the several lots therein, but which have not become public
ways, and ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions and, in proper cases, parks and open
space.
In achieving these purposes, the powers of the Board shall be exercised:
1.03a With due regard for the provision of adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by
ways that will be safe and convenient for travel;
1.03b For lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways;
1.03c For reducing danger to life and limb in the operation of motor vehicles;
1.03d For securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and other emergency;
1.03e For ensuring compliance with the Nantucket Zoning Bylaw;
1.03f For securing adequate provision of water, sewerage, drainage, underground utility
service, fire, police and other municipal equipment, street lighting, and other requirements,
where necessary, in a subdivision; and
1.03g For coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other and with the public ways in
the Town and with the ways in neighboring subdivisions.
2
1.03h To advance the community master plan known as the Town's Goals and Objectives for
Balanced Growth, as amended from time to time by the Town Meeting, such plan to be
construed as conforming to the Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.), Chapter 41, Section
81-D
1.04 DEFINITIONS
As used in this document, words in singular include the plural and those in the plural include the
singular. The word "may" is permissive; the words "shall" or "will" are mandatory.
For the purpose of these Rules and Regulations, the following words used herein are hereby
defined as follows:
1.04a Applicant: The person who applies for the approval of a plan, or for approval not
required endorsement, or his administrators, executors, heirs, devisees, successors and assigns.
1.04b Board: The Planning Board of the Town of Nantucket.
1.04c Lot: An area of land in one ownership, with definite boundaries, used or available for
use, as the site of one or more buildings, and intended for transfer of ownership.
1.04d Subdivision: As defined in the Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 41, Section 81-L,
as amended.
1.05 WAIVER OF COMPLIANCE
Strict compliance with the requirements of these Rules and Regulations may be waived when,
in the judgement of the Board, such action is in the public interest, and not inconsistent with the
Subdivision Control Law. The application for approval of a definitive plan must be accompanied
by a written request for waiver of strict compliance with these rules, the regulation sought to be
waived, the nature and location of the waiver sought, and a statement by the applicant's
surveyor or engineer that such waiver is consistent with each of the purposes set forth in Section
1.03 of these Rules and Regulations.
1.06 AMENDMENTS
These regulations or any portion thereof may be amended, supplemented or repealed from time
to time by the Board after a public hearing on its own motion or by petition.
3
SECTION II
SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF PLANS
2.01 GENERAL
Only those plans which constitute "subdivisions", as that term is defined in Section 1.04d,
require the approval of the Board. However, all plans, whether "subdivisions" within the
meaning of the law or not, must be reviewed by the Board before any approval is given, or
before an endorsement is made that the plan does not constitute a subdivision and therefore
does not require approval. The Register of Deeds of Nantucket shall not record any plan
showing a division of a tract of land into two or more lots, and ways, whether existing or
proposed, providing access thereto, unless (1) such plan bears an endorsement of the Planning
Board that such plan has been approved by the Planning Board, and a certificate by the Town
Clerk is endorsed on the plan, or is separately recorded and referred to on said plan, that no
notice of appeal was received during the twenty days next after receipt and recording of notice
from the Planning Board of the approval of the plan, or, if an appeal was taken, that a final
decree has been entered by the court sustaining the approval of the plan, or (2) such plan bears
an endorsement of the Planning Board that approval of such plan is not required, or (3) the plan
is accompanied by a certificate of the Town Clerk that it is a plan which has been approved by
reason of the failure of the Planning Board to act thereon within the time prescribed, or that it is
a plan submitted pursuant to Section 81P and that it has been determined by failure of the
Planning Board to act thereon within the prescribed time that approval is not required. In order
to obtain a permit for the erection of a building on a lot, a way giving access to such lot must
appear on a plan recorded at the Nantucket Registry of Deeds or entitled to be recorded under
Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 41, Section 81X.
2.02 SUBMISSION COMPLETENESS
No plan for review, whether for approval or for endorsement of approval not required, shall be
accepted as a submittal unless and until all information necessary for such review, as described
herein under the applicable provisions of submission requirements, are fully provided, unless
waived in writing by the Board. At the time of submission, a determination shall be made by the
Planning Board, or its designee, using a checklist, that the submission materials are either
complete or incomplete. If the submission has been determined to be incomplete, the plan shall
be returned to the applicant either in person or by certified mail with a letter indicating that
insufficient information has been provided making it impossible for the Board to adequately
review the plan, to approve the plan or endorse the plan "Approval Not Required." Incomplete
plans shall not be considered submittals and shall not be considered the start of any time limits
within which the Board is required to act under various provisions of the State law.
2.03 PLANS BELIEVED NOT TO REQUIRE APPROVAL (ANR)
The following provisions apply to all plans for which "Approval Not Required" endorsement is
desired.
2.03a "Approval Not Required" Plan Submission Requirements.
Any person may submit a plan seeking endorsement that the plan does not require approval
4
under the Subdivision Control Law by providing the Board with the following:
1. An original plan on linen or reproducible mylar and two paper prints of the plan
showing:
(a) The area, frontage and dimensions of the lot or lots requiring endorsement
and any contiguous lots in common beneficial ownership whose dimensions are
altered by the plan having area or frontage less than twice the prevailing
required area and/or frontage for the zoning district in which the land is located.
In the case where said contiguous lots have less than twice the required
frontage but more than twice the area, only the frontage shall be shown on the
plan.
(b) The date of the plan, scale, north point;
(c) The names of the record owner and the applicant, and the name, seal and
signature of the registered surveyor.
(d) Abutting properties with the names of owners from the most recent tax list
and showing all relevant abutting lot lines;
(e) Zoning classification data, wetlands and floodplains;
(f) The Assessor's map and parcel number as it is recorded on the official tax
maps of Nantucket and recently recorded plans for the parcel;
(g) The name(s) of the way(s) on which the lots front;
(h) The physical condition of the way(s) shown on the plan including actual
width, surface condition and available drainage;
(i) An area set aside for the signatures of Board members, file number and date
of endorsement preceded by the words "Approval Under the Subdivision
Control Law Not Required, Nantucket Planning Board";
(j) A locus plan at a scale of at least 1"=2000', containing sufficient information
so that the land can be readily located, including streets bounding on or near the
property;
(k) Each plan shall contain a note or notes as to the compliance of each lot
shown thereon with the Lot Area requirements as provided in the Nantucket
Zoning Bylaw, Chapter 139 ss 2A and 16A. The Mylar plan shall show the
entire area of such lot as computed pursuant to the minimum technical standards
for surveys as set forth under 250 CMR 6.01, including such areas subject to
protection under the State Wetlands Protection Act.
The notes to be set forth on each such plan, as applicable in each individual
instance, shall be substantially to the following effect:
5
The Planning Board determines that:
(a) Lot(s) is/are subject in part to protection under the Massachusetts
Wetlands Protection Act, but contain sufficient Lot Area, as defined in the
Nantucket Zoning Bylaw, to comply with the applicable zoning requirements.
A Notice of Intent may be required to be filed with the Nantucket Conservation
Commission with regard to proposed construction on such lot(s).
(b) Lot(s) do not contain areas subject to protection under the
Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act which are required to be excluded
from Lot Area under the Nantucket Zoning Bylaw, but still may be subject to
protection under State and Local Wetland bylaws. Determination of
applicability may be obtained through application to the Conservation
Commission.
(c) Lot(s) contain inadequate Lot Area, as defined in the Nantucket
Zoning Bylaw, to comply with minimum area requirements applicable under
such Bylaw.
To enable the Board to make such findings, a third separate paper print shall
serve as a worksheet to determine Lot Area compliance with zoning. This print
shall show the full area of the lot, and shall also show the full area computed in
accordance with the Nantucket Zoning Bylaw. The boundary of each such
area subject to protection under the State Wetlands Protection Act which is
excluded from Lot Area under the Nantucket Zoning Bylaw shall be clearly
shown and labeled upon each such plan. A note shall be included on this plan
which shall be substantially to the following effect:
Wetlands lines are approximate and for purposes of determining zoning
compliance only.
Any necessary supporting documentation shall be submitted along with the
worksheet plan as part of the submission and will be kept on file with signed
plans at the Planning Board office.
2. A properly executed Form A application as shown in Appendix B.
3. Necessary evidence to show that the plan does not require approval, which shall
include the precise legal ownership of the way(s) and proper positive documentation
that every lot within the divided tract has frontage either on a public way or a way which
the Town Clerk certifies is maintained and used as a public way or a way shown on a
plan theretofore approved and endorsed in accordance with the Subdivision Control
Law; or a way in existence on February 16, 1955, having, in the opinion of the Planning
Board, sufficient width, suitable grades and adequate construction to provide for the
needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the proposed use of the land abutting thereon or
served thereby, and for the installation of municipal services to serve such land and the
buildings erected or to be erected thereon. All plans seeking Approval Not Required
endorsement shall be accompanied by adequate evidence that there is practical interior
access to the proposed house sites.
6
Plans and profiles of access roads previously approved by the Planning Board which do
not provide frontage for any lot shown on a subject plan shall not be construed as a way
shown on a plan theretofore approved and endorsed in accordance with the Subdivision
Control Law.
2.03b "Approval Not Required" Plan Filing Procedures.
Persons seeking endorsement of plans "Approval Not Required" shall submit such
plans, either by mail or in person, to the Nantucket Planning Board, the Town &
County Building, 16 Broad Street, Nantucket, Massachusetts 02554. In order to be
included in the agenda for consideration at a Planning Board meeting the plan must be
submitted to the Planning Board office before noon of the Wednesday before the
meeting. Any plans received after the Wednesday noon deadline will automatically be
carried over to the agenda for the following meeting, unless the chair, with staff’s
recommendation, determines there are special circumstances that warrant a late
submittal.
A fee shall accompany the application in the amount of fifty dollars ($50) per lot and
twenty dollars ($20) per lot for plan updates.
The applicant shall file, by delivery or registered mail, a notice with the Town Clerk
stating the date of submission for such determination.
2.03c "Approval Not Required" Plan Action
A determination of wetland boundaries from the Nantucket Conservation Commission
may be required in order to verify that the area of one or more lots complies with zoning
requirements. For plans which are submitted without such determination, and for which
a question as to the accuracy of the delineation of wetland boundaries arises, the
applicant shall obtain a determination from the Conservation Commission. Failure to do
so within the 21-day statutory decision period shall cause the Planning Board to add a
notation to the plan stating that the lot in question has not been determined to have
sufficient area to comply with zoning requirements and to notify the Building Department
that a Building Permit shall not be issued until the Planning Board has been provided
satisfactory information to determine that the lot in question has sufficient area to meet
Lot Area requirements.
If the Board determines that the plan does not require approval, it shall forthwith,
without public hearing, endorse the plan accordingly. The plan shall be returned to the
applicant so endorsed within fourteen (14) days of submission of said plan.
If the Board determines that the plan does require approval, it shall, without a public
hearing and within twenty-one (21) days of submission, notify the applicant and the
Town Clerk of the determination.
If the Board fails to take action within twenty-one (21) days of submission, the plan is
automatically deemed not a subdivision plan and the Board shall forthwith make such
endorsement. On its failure to do so forthwith, the Town Clerk shall issue a certificate to
7
the same effect.
2.03d Ways in Existence
Existing ways will normally be determined by the Board to provide adequate access to
qualify a plan as not constituting a subdivision only when the layout, design and
construction meet the standards of these Rules and Regulations.
2.04 PRE-SUBMISSION REVIEW (SKETCH PLAN)
Prior to investing in extensive professional design efforts for subdivision plans, it will often prove
useful to review the proposed development of a parcel of land with the Board in an informal
manner, in order that general approaches, possible use of cluster development, and potential
problems can be freely explored. Pencil sketches and other illustrations, which need not be
professionally prepared, will assist the discussion, and might show some, but not all, of the
information shown on a Preliminary Plan. In some cases, pre-submission review may eliminate
the advisability of submitting a Preliminary Plan. However, the pre-submission review provision
is strictly a voluntary procedure left to the discretion of the applicant. The pre-submission review
has no legal status whatsoever, insofar as zoning exemptions are concerned.
2.05 PRELIMINARY PLAN
A Preliminary Plan of a Residential Subdivision may, and a Preliminary Plan of a Nonresidential
Subdivision shall, be submitted by the subdivider for discussion and approval, modification or
disapproval by the Planning Board and the Board of Health. The submission of such a
Preliminary Plan will enable the subdivider, the Planning Board, and other municipal agencies to
discuss and clarify the problems of such a subdivision before extensive engineering costs are
incurred in the preparation of the Definitive Plan.
2.05a Submission Requirements for Preliminary Plans shall be drawn on tracing paper, or a
print thereof, and shall show:
(1) the subdivision name, boundaries, north point, date, scale, legend and title
"Preliminary Plan;"
(2) the names of the record owner and the applicant and the names of the designer,
engineer and surveyor;
(3) the names of all abutters, as determined from the most recent tax list;
(4) the existing and proposed line of streets, ways, easements, any public or common
areas and lots shown in a general manner;
(5) a schematic representation of the proposed system of drainage, including adjacent
existing natural waterways;
(6) the approximate boundary lines of proposed lots, with approximate areas and
dimensions;
8
(7) the names, approximate location and widths of adjacent streets;
(8) the topography of the land in a general manner, including areas of the tract
suspected to be flood prone and/or wetlands;
(9) a vicinity map to appear in the upper right corner of the plan showing the location
of the parcel as it relates to areas of the community within at least one-half mile of the
tract boundaries (suggested scale: 1"=2,000');
(10) the zoning classification of the land to be subdivided;
(11) proposed sewage, water and utility systems, shown in a general manner; and
(12) in the case of a subdivision covering less than all of the land owned by the
subdivider in the area of the subdivision, a plan showing, in a general manner, the
proposed overall development of all of said land.
2.05b Filing Procedures for Preliminary Plans
An application for consideration of the Preliminary Plan shall be accompanied by twelve
(12) contact prints of the plan and a filing fee of $50.00. The applicant shall also file one
(1) contact print with the Board of Health.
The applicant shall give written notice to the Town Clerk of Nantucket by delivery or by
registered mail, postage prepaid, that he has submitted such a plan.
2.05c Plan Action for Preliminary Plans
Within forty-five (45) days after submission of a Preliminary Plan, the Board shall either
approve the plan with or without modifications, or the Board shall disapprove the plan.
In the case of disapproval, the Board shall state its reasons therefor. The Board shall
notify the Town Clerk of its action in writing. The action of the Board shall be on two
copies of the Preliminary Plan, referenced and attached to any conditions. One copy
shall be returned to the applicant and the other retained by the Board. Approval of the
Preliminary Plan does not constitute approval of the subdivision for recording but does
facilitate the procedure in securing approval of the Definitive Plan. The Rules and
Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in effect at the time of its submission
shall govern the Definitive Plan evolved from such Preliminary Plan, provided that the
Definitive Plan is duly submitted within seven months from the date of submission of the
Preliminary Plan and said Definitive Plan is ultimately approved. Such exemptions shall
endure for eight (8) years from the date of Definitive Plan approval.
2.06 DEFINITIVE PLAN OF A SUBDIVISION (AR)
The Definitive Plan of a subdivision shall conform substantially to the Preliminary Plan as
approved but may constitute only that portion which is proposed to be recorded and developed
at the time. The subdivision Rules and Regulations and zoning in effect at the time of the
submission of the Preliminary Plan shall govern the Definitive Plan if it is duly submitted within
seven months.
9
Applicants are strongly urged to schedule a pre-submission conference and tour with the
Planning Board and its staff to identify as early as possible any items requiring special attention.
2.06a Submission Requirements
An applicant seeking approval of a Definitive Plan of a subdivision shall file with the
Board the following:
(1) The original drawings of the Definitive Plan and twelve (12) prints thereof which
shall be distributed for review to the following agencies: Conservation Commission,
Department of Public Works, Fire Department and Water Company.
(2) A street network plan shall be submitted on 8.5" X 11" paper showing, at a
minimum, proposed, existing, and adjacent streets, names and locations of abutters,
north arrow, and any adjacent natural features.
(3) A properly executed application in the form shown as Form B in Appendix B,
which form may be changed from time to time by the Planning Board.
(4) A list of the names and addresses of all abutters, certified as complete by the Tax
Assessor, plus a set of gummed mailing labels bearing these names and addresses plus a
set of certified mailing materials, i.e., both (1) Receipts for Certified Mail and (2)
Domestic Return Receipts, all appropriately and completely prepared for mailing.
"Abutters" shall be defined as those landowners immediately bordering the proposed
subdivision, those landowners abutting the immediate abutters, and those landowners
located directly across all segments of streets and ways bordering the proposed
subdivision.
(5) A master plan showing a possible or prospective street and lot layout for any
adjacent unsubdivided land owned or controlled by the owner or subdivider of the
subdivision shall be submitted, unless such a plan has already been filed with the Board.
(6) A filing fee shall accompany the application in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00)
plus fifty cents ($0.50) per linear feet of proposed or reconstructed ways located within
and outside the subdivision.
(7) In addition to the filing fee, applications shall be accompanied by a check in the
amount of two (2) dollars per linear foot of new or reconstructed interior or perimeter
roadway in accordance with Section 2.06(k) located herein, to be deposited into a
Road Inspection Escrow Account within the Town Treasury, to be kept separate from
other funds, the proceeds of which shall be drawn upon from time to time by the Board
to pay for costs associated with the inspection of the applicants required public
improvements.
(8) A proposed covenant or bond in accordance with Section 2.06f - Performance
Guarantee.
(9) Notice to Town Clerk: The applicant shall give written notice to the Town Clerk by
10
delivery or by registered mail, postage prepaid, that he has submitted such a Definitive
Plan, accompanied by a copy of the application, within forty-eight (48) hours of
submission. If the notice is given by delivery, the Town Clerk shall, if requested,
give a written receipt therefore to the person who delivered such notice. Such notice
shall describe the land to which the plan relates sufficiently for identification, and shall
state the date when such plan was submitted and the name and address of the owner of
such land; and the facts stated in such notice shall be taken by the Town Clerk as true,
unless contrary is made to appear. If sent by registered mail, the date of the mailing
shall be the date of submission of the Definitive Plan. The Definitive Plan shall be
considered submitted only when all plan requirements specified in Section 2.06(a) and
2.06(b) of these Rules & Regulations are included, unless waived in writing by the
Board, as provided in Section 1.05.
(10) The Planning Board shall require the submission of storm drainage runoff flow
calculations in order to evaluate the drainage plan.
(11) Site Analysis Report and Map:
An applicant seeking approval of a Definitive Plan shall submit, at the time of
filing, three (3) copies of a Site Analysis Report and three (3) copies of a Site
Analysis Map. Any submission of a Definitive Plan lacking these documents will
be considered incomplete (Section 2.02).
The Site Analysis Map shall be one sheet of drawing paper no larger than 42
inches by 60 inches and shall show the entire subdivision at a suitable scale. If
the Definitive Plan includes less than the Preliminary Plan from which it was
derived, the Site Analysis Map shall include all the land shown on the
Preliminary Plan. Applicants are encouraged to use tissue, acetate or mylar
overlays in conjunction with a paper base map. The base for the Site Analysis
Map shall show tract boundaries, proposed lots, ways, easements, open
spaces, landmarks and existing structures and roads within one hundred (100)
feet of the tract boundaries. Overlays using color or black and white patterns
shall show the following information:
m Wetlands, including ponds, marshes, bogs, streams and all areas of the site
subject to the Massachusetts Coastal Wetlands Act, as amended;
m Areas of Special Flood Hazard, as designated by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development as part of the Flood Insurance Program for
Nantucket;
m Areas with Severe Limitations for On-Site Sewage Systems , as
mapped by the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Soil Survey of the Island
of Nantucket;
m Areas with Severe Limitations Due to Seasonal High Water Table,
as mapped by the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Soil Survey for the
Island of Nantucket;
11
m Areas where Special Drainage, Erosion and Sedimentation
Measures will be undertaken. Arrows shall show the predominant drainage
patterns. The location of catchment basins and points of discharge shall be
shown. Two foot contour lines also appear on this map;
m Predominant Vegetative Cover Type, including areas of the site the
applicant feels are important to protect and all areas containing stands of trees
with three (3) inch caliper or more; and
m Protected Areas, including all areas of the tract permanently kept from
being developed by virtue of their being scenic, access, drainage or slope
easements, or through other interest of fee simple grants of land to a
conservation group or homeowners association.
The Site Analysis Report shall be a typed copy on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with a cover
sheet indicating the name of the subdivision, the owner of the land, the applicant, the
engineer/surveyor/land planner and the date of submission. The report shall consist of a
narrative statement and appropriate data, documenting the likely impact of the
subdivision on the following subject areas with references to the Site Analysis Map:
m Surface Water Resources. How will the proposed subdivision, when
fully developed, effect the quality and quantity of ponds, marshes, bogs, streams
and other surface water resources both on and off the site? What measures
have been taken to assure full compliance with the State Coastal Wetlands Act?
Will drainage easements be used to identify and protect portions of individual
lots subject to the State Coastal Wetlands Act in order that prospective
purchasers of lots in the subdivision will be adequately aware of the status of
their property? What erosion and sediment control measures will be taken to
prevent undue loss of topsoil and sedimentation of surface waters during
construction? Has public access been provided to significant surface water
resources?
m Ground Water Resources. How will the proposed subdivision when fully
developed, effect the quality and quantity of ground water resources in the
area? Has every effort been made to tie in with the community-wide sewage
system? Have percolation tests been done on every lot to be used for
residential or commercial purposes in the subdivision?
m Flood Hazard. Has the layout of streets and lots fully reflected the need to
protect life and property by properly locating building lots out of areas of
Special Flood Hazard as delineated by the Federal Government? Will
floodway easements be used to protect these areas from encroachment and
advise lot purchasers of the nature of their prospective property? Has the
proposed system of drainage taken severe storm damage into account?
m Vegetative Cover. Are there any groves of trees with three (3) inch
caliper or more; what measures have been taken to protect them? Has the
applicant considered cooperating with the Nantucket Conservation District in
reforesting portions of the tract at minimal cost? Have scenic or access
12
easements or fee simple grants of land been employed to protect valuable areas
of the site?
m Traffic Safety and Convenience. Does the subdivision provide for
adequate internal circulation for both pedestrian and vehicular/bicycle traffic? Is
the site served adequately by existing roads in the area when other subdivisions
(both built-up and unbuilt) are considered? Has the applicant considered tying
in with Nantucket's Island-wide bicycle path system? Has there been sufficient
consideration for tying into anticipated future subdivisions on adjacent tracts of
land now vacant? Will emergency vehicles be able to properly service this new
neighborhood? What form of performance guarantee will be used for all public
improvements? What is the physical condition of adjacent roads and access
roads (width, surface and drainage)? What is the precise legal ownership of
adjacent roads and access roads? Will the subdivision substantially effect traffic
flow and safety in the area surrounding the subdivision, and if so, what mitigating
measures are being undertaken to decrease any detrimental effects?
m Development Phasing. When will all the required public improvements be
completed? If this is the first of several Definitive Plans based on a larger
Preliminary Plan, when does the applicant expect to submit other Definitive
Plans? What will be the maximum number of dwelling units on this Definitive
Plan (including seasonal cottages)?
m Common Open Spaces. If the applicant includes in the plan common
open spaces and other neighborhood facilities and services, how will such areas
be owned and maintained (homeowners association, trust, condominium
association, etc.)? Are these areas permanently preserved?
If any questions arise during the public hearing concerning the aforementioned subject
areas, the Planning Board may require complete and detailed substantiation of any claim
by the applicant, which could include an investigation by an outside consultant.
(12) If, in the opinion of the Planning Board, the size, scale or location of the subdivision may
result in a significant impact on the surrounding road system, the Board may require the
applicant to submit a traffic study. The study shall be prepared by a professional engineer
specializing in traffic analysis, and identify, at a minimum, the following:
(a) Internal vehicular circulation patterns
(b) Estimated daily and peak hour vehicle trips
(c) The measured daily and peak hour traffic flows, both weekday and weekend (nonholiday),
measured during the period between June 15 and September 15, or other
times as the Board may deem appropriate, on public and private roads and key
intersections expected to be impacted by the project
(d) Proposed composite daily and peak hour traffic on public and private roads and key
intersections: a documentation of impacts on level of service
(e) Suggested remedial measures to mitigate the expected impacts of the proposed
subdivision.
Applicants are urged to meet with the Planning Board or planning staff prior to preparation of
13
the study to identify the study area and the appropriate elements of the traffic study.

entire area of such lot as computed pursuant to the minimum technical standards
for surveys as set forth under the State Wetlands Protection Act.
The notes to be set forth on each such plan, as applicable in each individual
instance, shall be substantially to the following effect:
The Planning Board determines that:
(a) Lot(s) is/are subject in part to protection under the
Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, but contain sufficient Lot
Area, as defined in the Nantucket Zoning Bylaw, to comply with
applicable zoning requirements. A Notice of Intent may be required to
be filed with the Nantucket Conservation Commission with regard to
proposed construction of such lot(s).
(b) Lot(s) do not contain areas subject to protection under
the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act which are required to be
excluded from Lot Area under the Nantucket Zoning Bylaw but still
may be subject to protection under State and Local Wetland Bylaw.
Determination of applicability may be obtained through application to
the Conservation Commission.
(c) Lot(s) contain inadequate Lot Area, as defined in the
Nantucket Zoning Bylaw, to comply with minimum area requirements
applicable under such bylaw.
To enable the Board to make such findings, a third, separate paper print shall serve as
worksheet to determine Lot Area compliance with zoning. This print shall show the full
area of the lot, and shall also show the area of lot as computed in accordance with the
Zoning Bylaw. The boundary of each such area subject to protection under the State
Wetlands Protection Act which is excluded from Lot Area under the Nantucket
Zoning Bylaw shall be clearly shown and labeled upon each such plan. A note shall be
included on this plan which shall be substantially to the following effect:
Wetlands lines are approximate and for purposes of determining zoning
compliance only.
Any necessary supporting documentation shall be submitted along with the worksheet
16
plan as part of the submission and will be kept on file with signed plans at the Planning
Board office.
2.06c Review By Board of Health
At the time of filing of the Definitive Plan, the subdivider shall also file with the Board of
Health two (2) prints of the Definitive Plan and comply with other Board of Health
requirements, including percolation tests and test excavations.
The Board of Health shall, within 45 days after filing of the plan, report to the Planning
Board in writing, with their recommendation of approval or disapproval of said plan. If
the Board of Health disapproves said plan, it shall make specific findings as to which, if
any, of the lots shown on such plan cannot be used for building sites without injury to
the public's health.
Every building lot so located that it cannot be served by a connection to the municipal
sewer system shall be provided with a sewage disposal system approved by the Board
of Health.
2.06d Review By Other Officials
Before the Definitive Plan is submitted, the Planning Board urges that the applicant
consult with and obtain written statements that the proposed improvements shown on a
separate Utility Plan or Road Plan and Profiles are laid out to the satisfaction of the
following authorities and for the facilities listed below:
(a) The Chief of the Fire Department as to the location of hydrants, adequacy of
water flow at the hydrant, the layout of a fire alarm system, including location of
boxes and location and installation of emergency water supply systems for fire
fighting.
(b) The Department of Public Works as to the requirements for provision for
connections to and compatibility with the sewer system and, if required, the
layout and design of the necessary connecting mains, laterals, manholes, and
stubs for such system. In such cases, review by the DPW Superintendent will
include the profiles of the streets.
(c) The Manager of the Wannacomet Water Company and Siasconset Water
Department as to the location and size of water mains, including service to the
fire hydrants.
(d) The Nantucket Electric Company as to the requirements for electricity.

Protection Act (M.G.L. Chapter 131, Section 40 and 40A).
17
2.06e Staking of Subdivision
In order to facilitate on-site review by the various reviewing agencies, the applicant
shall, at the time of filing of the Definitive Plan, stake and brush cut to a minimum of five
(5) feet the centerline of all proposed ways in the subdivision and shall stake all points
where lot lines intersect rights-of-way.
2.06f Performance Guarantee
Before endorsement of its approval of a Definitive Plan, the Planning Board shall require
that the construction of ways and the installation of municipal services be secured by
one of the four methods listed below, or a combination of methods which, from time to
time, may be varied by the applicant upon approval of the Board:
(1) By a proper bond, sufficient in the opinion of the Planning Board to secure
performance of the construction of ways and the installation of municipal
services required for lots in the subdivision shown on the plan, and the Planning
Board may require that the applicant specify the time within which such
construction shall be completed.
(2) By a deposit of money or negotiable securities sufficient in the opinion of the
Planning Board to secure performance of the construction of ways and the
installation of municipal services required for lots in the subdivision shown on the
plan, and the Planning Board may require that the applicant specify the time
within which such construction shall be completed.
(3) By a covenant, executed and duly recorded by the owner of record, running
with the land, whereby such ways and services shall be provided to serve any
lot before such lot may be built upon or conveyed, other than by mortgage
deed; provided, that a mortgagee who acquired title to the mortgaged premises
by foreclosure or otherwise and any succeeding owner of such premises or part
thereof may sell any such lot, subject to that portion of the covenant which
provided that no lot shall be built upon until such ways and services have been
provided to serve each lot; and provided, further, that nothing herein shall be
deemed to prohibit a conveyance by a single deed, subject to such covenant, of
either the entire parcel of land shown on the subdivision plan or of all lots not
previously released by the Planning Board. A deed of any part of the
subdivision in violation hereof shall be voidable by the grantee prior to the
release of the covenant but not later than three years from the date of such
deed. A suggested, but not required, form of the covenant is given by Form I in
Appendix B; which form may be changed from time to time by the Planning
Board.
Any covenant given under the preceding paragraph and any condition required
by the Board of Health shall be either inscribed on the plan or contained in a
separate document, referred to on the plan.
(4) By delivery to the Planning Board of an agreement executed after the
recording of a first mortgage covering the premises shown on the plan or a
18
portion thereof given as security for advances to be made to the applicant by
the lender, which agreement shall be executed by the applicant and the lender
and shall provide for the retention by the lender of funds sufficient in the opinion
of the Planning Board and otherwise due the applicant to secure the
construction of ways and the installation of municipal services. Said agreement
shall also provide for a schedule of disbursements which may be made to the
applicant upon completion of various stages of the work, and shall further
provide that in the event the work is not completed within the time set forth by
the applicant, any funds remaining undisbursed shall be available for completion.
The penal sum of any such performance guarantee described under clause (a),
(b) or (d) shall bear a direct and reasonable relationship to the expected cost,
including the effects of inflation, necessary to complete the subject work. Such
amount or amounts shall from time to time be reduced so that the amount
bonded, deposited or retained continues to reflect the actual expected cost of
work remaining to be completed.
The form of the performance guarantee may be as given by Form G, or Form I
in Appendix B, or as otherwise required by the Board and shall be contingent
upon the completion of said improvements within two (2) years of the date of
the Agreement. At the discretion of the Board, a time extension may be granted
for a period not to exceed one (1) year; provided such an extension may be
conditioned upon an increase in the amount of such bond or security as
determined by the Board.
The failure of the applicant to complete the required construction of ways and
installation of municipal services within two (2) years from the date of the
Agreement shall be grounds for the rescission of the approval of the plan.
2.06g Public Hearing
Before approval, modification and approval or disapproval of the Definitive Plan, a
public hearing shall be held by the Board after proper advertisements and notification of
abutters as provided by Section 81T of the Subdivision Control Law.
2.06h Plan Action
After the public hearing, the Board shall approve, or, if such plan does not comply with
the Subdivision Control Law, these Rules and Regulations or recommendations of the
Board of Health, shall modify and approve, or disapprove the Definitive Plan. In the
event of disapproval, the Board shall state in detail wherein the plan does not conform
to the Rules and Regulations and recommendations of the Board of Health and shall
revoke its disapproval and approve a plan which, as amended, conforms to such Rules
and Regulations or recommendations.
In the case of a nonresidential subdivision where a preliminary plan has been duly
submitted and acted upon or where forty-five (45) days have elapsed since submission
of the said preliminary plan, and then a definitive plan is submitted, and failure of the
Planning Board either to take final action or to file with the Town Clerk a certificate of
19
such action regarding the definitive plan submitted by an applicant within ninety (90)
days after such submission, or such further time may be agreed upon at the written
request of the applicant, shall be deemed to be an approval thereof. Notice of such
extension of time shall be filed forthwith by the Planning Board with the Town Clerk.
In the case of a subdivision showing lots in a residential zone, where a preliminary plan
has been acted upon by the Planning Board or where at least forty-five (45) days has
elapsed since submission of the preliminary plan, and a definitive plan is submitted, the
failure of the Planning Board to take final action or to file with the Town Clerk a
certificate of such action on the definitive plan within ninety (90) days after such
submission, or such further time as may be agreed upon at the written request of the
applicant, shall be deemed to be an approval thereof. Notice of such extension shall be
filed forthwith by the Planning Board with the Town Clerk.
In the case of a subdivision showing lots in a residential zone, where no preliminary plan
has been submitted and acted upon or where forty-five (45) days has not elapsed since
submission of such preliminary plan, and a definitive plan is submitted, the failure of the
Planning Board either to take final action or to file with the Town Clerk a certificate of
such action regarding the definitive plan submitted by an applicant within one hundred
and thirty-five (135) days after such submission, or such further time as may be agreed
upon at the written request of the applicant, shall be deemed to be an approval thereof.

(20) days without notice of appeal to the Superior Court, or if appeal has been taken
after the entry of a final decree of the court sustaining the approval of such plan, the
Board shall cause to be made upon the plan a written endorsement of its approval. The
applicant shall have submitted to the Board a set of plans appropriately prepared for
said endorsement and shall have included with these plans a road layout plan reduced to
fit 8.5" x 11" paper. In case of the approval of such plan by reason of the failure of the
Board to act within the time prescribed, the Town Clerk shall, after the expiration of
twenty (20) days without notice of appeal to the Supreme Court, or, if appeal has been
taken, after receipt of certified records of the Supreme Court indicating that such
approval has become final, issue a certificate stating the date of the submission of the
plan for approval, the fact that the Board failed to take action and that the approval
resulting from such failure has become final. The plan bearing such endorsement or the
plan and such certificate, as the case may be, shall be delivered by the Board, or, in the
case of the certificate, by the Town Clerk, to the person who submitted such plan.
2.06i Modification, Amendment, or Rescission of Approved Plans
The Board, on its own motion or on the petition of any interested person, has the power
to modify, amend, or rescind its approval of a plan, or to require a change in a plan as a
20
condition of its retaining the status of an approved plan. All of the provisions of the
Subdivision Control Law and these Rules and Regulations relating to the submission
and approval of a plan shall, so far as apt, be applicable to the approval of the
modification, amendment or rescission of such approval and to a plan that has been
changed under this section.

plan shall affect the lots in such subdivision which have been sold or mortgaged in good
faith and for a valuable consideration subsequent to the approval of the plan, or any
rights appurtenant thereto, without the consent of the owner of such lots, and of the
holder of the mortgage or mortgages, if any, thereon.
So far as unregistered land is affected, no modification, amendment or rescission of the
approval of a plan nor change in a plan under this section shall take effect until:
(1) the plan as originally approved, or copy thereof and a certificate copy of the
vote of the Board making such modification, amendment, rescission or change,
and any additional plan referred to in such vote, have been recorded;
(2) an endorsement has been made on the plan originally approved as recorded
referring to such vote and where it is recorded; and
(3) such vote is indexed in the grantor index under the names of the owners of
record of the land affected.

Board of Appeals or by the Planning Board concerning a plan of a subdivision, or by
failure of such a plan within the required time, or any municipal officer or board, may
appeal to the Superior Court sitting in equity for Nantucket County, provided, that such
appeal is entered within twenty (20) days after such decision has been recorded in the
office of the Town Clerk or within twenty (20) days after the required time aforesaid, as
the case may be, and notice of such appeal is given to the Town Clerk so as to be
received within twenty (20) days.
2.06k Inspection of Improvements
(a) General Procedure and Inspection Escrow Funds
Prior to the endorsement of a plan as approved, and prior to the return of such plan to
the Applicant, the Applicant shall be required to deposit with the Treasurer of the Town
an amount equal to two dollars ($2.00) times the number of linear feet of proposed or
21
reconstructed ways located within and outside of the boundaries of the subdivision. The
Planning Board shall direct the Treasurer to expend such funds to pay for all reasonable
design review, construction inspection services and subdivision modification design
reviews by its engineer or other professional persons required to assist the Planning
Board in its determination as to the adequacy of the Definitive Plan with regard to the
Subdivision Control Law and these Rules and Regulations and as to the adequacy of
the subdivision construction and any design modifications to the plan and changes made
in the field.
However, no such payment shall be directed until 14 days after a photocopy of the bill
purporting to represent charges for such services and review has been sent, by certified
mail, to the Applicant. The balance of this account shall at no time be less than one-half
the initial deposit, and the Applicant shall deposit with the Treasurer such additional
funds as are required to restore the account to the amount of the initial deposit upon
notice from the Board, by first class mail, that the amount on deposit has been
decreased by the expenditures described herein to an amount at or near one-half the
initial deposit. The account shall be closed and the remaining funds returned to the
Applicant when, in the opinion of the Board, all work required by the approved plan,
any conditions placed upon such approval, and any subsequently approved
modifications and these rules, and all inspections required by these rules, have been
completed.
The failure of the Applicant to make the initial deposit, and to maintain the account in
accordance with this section, shall be grounds for rescission the approval of the plan
and for disapproval.
The full cost of any special non-scheduled inspections deemed necessary by the failure
of construction to proceed entirely in accordance with the approved plan, or as a result
of any question concerning the accuracy of any data provided by the applicant at any
time, shall be borne by the applicant.
In the event the Planning Board denies approval of a plan, the account shall be closed
and the unexpended funds returned to the applicant within 21 days from the date the
subdivision plan was denied an approval.
The Planning Board in its discretion may waive or refund the inspection fee in whole or
in part to the extent the Board determines that professional or other services were not
required in consideration of the Definitive Plan.
2.06l "As Built" Plans, Profiles and Cross-Sections
Prior to release from the performance guarantee of the last twenty (20) percent of the
lots in a subdivision, the applicant shall submit "as built" plans and profiles, and crosssections
showing the actual constructed interior and access road(s), including any
curbing, shoulders, sidewalks/bicycle paths, drainage facilities, invert and top of frame
elevations for drainage structures, utility service connections (including sewer, water,
electric, etc.), utilities (including sizes, materials, and locations), “as built” contours for
detention and retention basins with contour intervals matching those depicted on the
22
subdivision plan, landscaping installed as per the definitive plan approval, and other
appurtenances as may have been required to be constructed. "As built" plans, profiles
and cross-sections shall be prepared at the same scale and in the same format as those
which accompanied the Definitive Plan. Plans and profiles shall be prepared using data
points no less frequently than every fifty (50) feet, except within fifty (50) feet on either
side of any catch basins, in which case data points shall be every twenty-five (25) feet.
Plans and profiles shall also show the locations of structures, such as drainage facilities,
water lines, sewer lines, electrical, telephone and cable TV lines and their
appurtenances.
Cross-section of the right-of-way showing paving surface, curbing, shoulders and
sidewalks/bicycle paths shall be submitted for section every two hundred (200) feet as
measured from the centerline of adjoining streets. Nine (9) elevation points shall be
shown across the right-of-way, including centerline of road, five (5) feet off centerline in
both directions, both edges of surface, edge of right-of-way, top of slope or toe of
slope and edge of shoulders. Two (2) inch or greater core samples shall be taken and
reported along with each cross-section to determine thickness of paving material, said
samples to be determined by the Planning Board.
"As Built" plans, profiles and cross-sections shall be prepared by, bear the stamp of,
and be signed by a Registered Land Surveyor or Registered Engineer, and shall include
the statement "I hereby certify that the plans, profiles and cross sections included herein
were prepared as the result of survey work performed on the ground and represent
conditions in the field as they existed on (date)."
2.06m Acceptance of Water and Sewer Lines
All water lines shown on the subdivision plan shall be offered for acceptance to the local
municipal water company prior to the final release of security for the subdivision.
All sewer lines shown on the subdivision plan shall be offered for acceptance to the
Town or County of Nantucket prior to the final release of security for the subdivision.
2.06n Roadway Maintenance & Open Space Management
The Planning Board shall require the formation of a Home Owners' Association for
subdivisions containing common open areas and/or ways which will remain private, the
purpose of which is to maintain said private ways and open spaces for the protection of
the lot owners in the subdivision.
In cases where a home owners' association is required, there shall be written into each
deed out for every building lot in the subdivision, a set of covenants and restrictions, the
form and content of which shall be subject to the review and approval of the Planning
Board, which shall provide for the following:
(1) Establishment of a maintenance trust fund to be drawn upon from time to time by
the association to perform needed maintenance to and reconstruction of private roads,
as well as maintenance of common open spaces in the subdivision. Said fund shall
23
consist of two parts. (a) A maintenance endowment shall be established by the
developer in the amount of two-hundred ($200) dollars per lot, prior to the release of
any lot in the subdivision. The principal amount of the endowment shall not be drawn
upon by the association for at least 25 years from the date of its establishment, at which
time it may be drawn upon for maintenance or reconstruction of roads. (b) Annual
maintenance deposits shall consist of interest generated by the endowment and annual
assessments made to association members, the amount of such annual assessment to be
established by majority vote of the Association.
24
SECTION III
SUBDIVISION LAYOUT DESIGN STANDARDS
3.01 ZONING
All lots shown on the plan shall comply with area, frontage and other requirements of the
Nantucket Zoning Bylaw.
3.02 PUBLIC OPEN SPACES
Before approval of a plan by the Planning Board, the Board shall also in proper cases require
the plan to show a park or parks suitably located for playground or recreation purposes, or for
providing light and air and not unreasonable in area in relation to the area of the land being
subdivided and the prospective uses of such land, and if so determined said board shall by
appropriate endorsement on the plan require that no building may be erected on such park or
parks for a period of not more than 3 years without its approval.
3.03 PROTECTION OF WETLANDS
All subdivisions shall comply with Local Town Bylaw (Chapter 136) on Wetland Protection and
the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (Chapter 131 of the General Laws, Section 40, as
amended) and the rules and regulations promulgated under the provision of said act by the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.
In addition to compliance of all proposed public improvements with the Wetlands Protection
Act and the Town Wetlands Bylaw, the layout of all lots and open spaces shall comply with the
intent of said Act and local bylaw and the rules and regulations promulgated under them by
protecting wetlands through the use of one, or a combination of several, of the following
methods:
3.03a Making lots large enough and of such shape and location so that anticipated future
structures and access to those structures may be accompanied with full compliance to the
Wetlands Protection Act and local Wetlands Bylaw and their rules and regulations; or
3.03b Designating wetland areas as common open space to be deeded, fee simple, to the
Nantucket Conservation Commission, a home owners association or suitable conservation
organization. (Nothing herein shall obligate the Town of Nantucket to accept such common
open space.); or
3.03c The inclusion of conservation easements in the plan to accommodate Wetlands areas.
3.04 FLOOD PRONE AREAS
All subdivisions shall be designed with due regard to the prevention of loss of life and property
due to flooding. Areas shall be considered flood prone which appear on the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development Federal Insurance Administration's Flood Hazard
Boundary Maps, as amended effective September 13, 1974. Applicants not in agreement with
this delineation may appeal the delineation by providing the Board with sufficient positive
25
documentation prepared by a registered engineer including, but not limited to, maps, profiles
and written historical accounts showing that the particular area being appealed is not, in fact,
subject to periodic flood hazard. If deemed valid, these materials will be used to petition HUD
to amend the official Flood Hazard Boundary Map for Nantucket. The arrangement, shape,
and size of lots on the plan shall protect future development of the site by any one, or a
combination of several, of the following methods:
3.04a Making lots large enough and of such shape and location that anticipated new structures
will be able to be safely sited within areas of each lot so that the lowest floor (including
basement) is elevated to above the level of the 100-year flood may be developed unless the
anticipated construction:
(1) is located landward of the reach of the mean high tide;
(2) is elevated on adequately anchored piles or columns to a lowest floor level
at or above the 100-year flood level and securely anchored to such piles or
columns; and
(3) has no basement and has the space below the lowest floor free of
obstructions so that the impact of abnormally high tides or wind-driven water is
minimized.
3.04b Designating flood hazard areas as common open space to be deeded fee simple to the
Nantucket Conservation Commission, a homeowners association or suitable conservation
organization. (Nothing herein shall obligate the Town of Nantucket to accept such common
open space.)
3.04c The inclusion of conservation easements in the plan to accommodate flood hazard areas.
All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems shall be located,
elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. Special drainage measures
shall be taken to reduce exposure of areas, both on and off-site, to flood damage.
3.05 PROTECTION OF NATURAL FEATURES
Due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as large trees, water courses, scenic
points, historic locations and similar community assets which, if preserved, will add
attractiveness and value to the neighborhood.
3.06 ONE DWELLING PER LOT
Not more than one building designed or available for use as a dwelling shall be erected or
placed or converted to such use on any lot in a subdivision or elsewhere in the Town, without
the consent of the Board and that such consent may be conditional upon the providing of
adequate ways furnishing access to each site for lots within a subdivision. A fee shall
accompany a request for a second dwelling in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). See also
§139-7A(2) of the Nantucket Zoning Bylaw.
26
3.07 FURTHER SUBDIVISION
In case a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be
arranged so as to allow the logical and economic extension of streets, utility easements, drainage
ways and public areas into such parcels.
3.08 HAZARDS
Land subject to hazard to life, health or property shall not be subdivided for residential purposes
until such hazards have been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards against such hazards are
provided by the subdivision.
3.09 REVERSE LOT FRONTAGE
The Board may require that proposed lots not front on existing major thoroughfares.
3.10 STREET SYSTEM
The street system shall comply with the following requirements for locations and alignments:
3.10a The street system shall conform to the Master Plan, if any, of proposed streets as
adopted in whole or in part by the Board;
3.10b Streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing streets as far as practicable;
3.10c Provisions shall be made for the proper projection of streets if adjoining property is not
subdivided.
3.10d Streets shall be designed to provide the most direct and convenient access to the site for
normal traffic and emergency vehicles, while still respecting the natural contours of the land as
far as possible.
27
SECTION IV
DESIGN STANDARDS AND REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
4.01 GENERAL
4.01a Subdivision plans shall comply with the following minimum design standards. Applicants
are encouraged to exceed these minimum standards whenever possible.
It is difficult to create design standards appropriate to all types and sizes of subdivisions. While
the standards included here are applicable to the vast majority of cases, there may be limited
instances where different standards may apply particularly for commercial and large-scale
development. For this reason, applicants are urged to discuss their proposals with the Planning
Board staff and Board members early in the concept stage of planning, before money is spent
on the final design, in order to determine if any different or additional standards would apply due
to the unique character of the proposal. The Planning Board reserves the right to require design
standards above the minimum standards described herein when a finding is made by the Board
that the purposes of the Subdivision Control Act would be better served by doing so.
4.02 ROADWAY LAYOUT AND PARCEL PERIMETER MONUMENTS
4.02a Monuments shall be installed on both sides of the street (a) at all intersections, (b) at all
points in change of direction or curvature, and (c) no less frequently than one monument every
five hundred (500) feet for straight sections.
4.02b Monuments shall be installed at each lot corner along the street.
4.02c All monuments shall be of reinforced concrete, five (5) inches by five (5) inches by thirty
(30) inches. Monuments to be set shall be shown on "As Built" plans as a solid box.
4.03 STREETS
4.03a Street width shall depend on the street's functional classification, as follows:
(1) A minor subdivision street which, in the opinion of the Board, provides access to
abutting lots, and is not intended for use by through traffic, shall be paved to a width of
not less than twenty (20) feet and shall be designed and constructed in conformance
with Section 5, Specifications for Construction of the Required Improvements and as
shown on Plate No. 5 in Appendix A.
(2) A secondary subdivision street which, in the opinion of the Board, carries traffic
from minor streets to major streets or community facilities, shall be paved to a width of
not less than twenty-two (22) feet and shall be designed and constructed in
conformance with Section 5, Specifications for Construction of the Required
Improvements and as shown on Plate No. 5 in Appendix A.
4.03b Street intersections shall be laid out as nearly as possible at right angles. No street shall
intersect any other street at less than sixty (60) degrees.
28
4.03c Changes in grading exceeding (0.5) of one percent shall be connected by vertical curves
of sufficient length.
4.03d Sight distances for subdivision roads intersecting major Island roads shall not be less
than 300 feet.
4.03e The following design standards for streets shall apply:

*Right-of-way shall be symmetrical with curbline radii of the street.
These design specifications represent minimum standards. More stringent design criteria
may be required by the Board.
4.04 DEAD-END STREETS
4.04a Dead-end streets shall not be longer than one thousand (1,000) feet unless, in the
opinion of the Board, a greater length is necessitated by topography or other local conditions.
4.04b Dead-end streets shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an
exterior layout radius of at least sixty (60) feet. The roadway shall have an exterior radius of at
least fifty (50) feet. An island suitably landscaped with grass, ground cover, trees, natural rock
and/or elements blending with the surroundings, shall be provided in the center of the turnaround
with a radius of at least thirty (30) feet. The island shall be enclosed with vertical granite curbing
with six (6) inch reveal from the roadway pavement. (See Appendix A, Plate Nos. 1 and 2 for
turnaround and island plan.) An island shall not be required in a temporary turnaround;
however, the turnaround shall be paved. When the dead-end street is extended, the turnaround
easement shall terminate and the applicant shall be required to remove, re-grade and restore the
turnaround area to the satisfaction of the Planning Board. Alternate turnarounds are contained
in Appendix A, Plate Nos. 3 and 4. The temporary turnaround shall conform to Appendix A,
Plates 1, 2, 3 and 4.
4.05 STREET CONSTRUCTION
All subdivision streets shall be constructed of an approved Roadway Pavement as specified
within Section 5 - Specifications for Construction of the Required Improvements.
4.05a Rural Road Alternative
In certain cases, where approval is sought for a subdivision on land of a rural or
sensitive nature, the Board may, at its discretion, waive strict compliance with the
requirements of Section 4.03 in order to allow roads more in keeping with the character
29
of the rural landscape. In such cases, the Board will consider the following factors
before granting a waiver of the standard road requirements:
l zoning and density of land use
l number of lots and probable traffic volume in the proposed subdivision
l applicable covenants restricting future density increase (e.g., one dwelling per lot)
l projected future development likely to use road
l other public uses of the road (e.g., beach access)
l road length
l design of the road and of the development with respect to preservation of open
space, scenic amenity, and other conservation measures.
The following standards shall apply to rural roads:
(1) Rural roads shall be designed with consideration for the natural contours
of the landscape, and should provide adequate natural drainage at all
points, while minimizing erosion both on and beside the road.
Depressions should be filled to a grade above that of the adjacent
roadside and, where possible, natural drainage measures (i.e., swales
and retention ponds) shall be employed rather than storm sewers and
catch basins. Where natural drainage is used, drainage easements shall
be provided to permit maintenance and to countenance possible water
accumulation. Appropriate measures should be taken to reduce
siltation and to preserve and restore roadside vegetation.
(2) Rural roads shall provide adequate access for emergency vehicles and
normal traffic through the provision of turnouts at appropriately spaced
intervals.
(3) Design and construction of rural roads shall conform to the
specifications of Type 8 Pavement (Stabilized Gravel Base) described
in Section 5.08 and Appendix A. Reductions in the width of the
traveled way may be permitted but in no case shall this way be less than
12' in width. A standard 40'-wide layout shall be maintained
throughout.
(4) When the rural road alternative is approved, the applicant shall be
required to establish a Road Maintenance Endowment fund, of a sum to
be specified by the Board, to ensure the proper long-tern maintenance
of the road(s). This fund shall be administered by a Homeowner's
Association, with the Planning Board named as a third party enforcing
agent, and shall be used for road reconstruction and its supporting
engineering review and inspection. The Planning Board shall devise a
maintenance schedule prior to approval, and this schedule shall be
incorporated into the documents creating the fund.
The Board reserves the right to require applicants to use this Rural Road
Alternative where it deems appropriate, notwithstanding the submission of an
application expressly requesting use of any of the other roadway specifications
30
outlined in Section 5.08.
4.06 STORM DRAINAGE
4.06a Subsurface Drains or Subdrains
In areas where the finished grade of the roadway is less than four (4) feet above the
water table or in areas where less than four (4) feet of fill is placed above water in
swampy places or any standing water, or in other areas, where on the opinion of the
Board, the subgrade must be drained, a system of subdrains shall be designed for such
areas. The subdrain shall consist of at least one longitudinal drain for each side of the
paved roadway. In addition, laterals may be required as directed by the Board in areas
in which an undue amount of water could accumulate in the subgrade. The system of
subdrains shall be discharged into the storm drain system or otherwise disposed of in a
manner satisfactory to the Board.
4.06b Storm Drains
A complete storm drain system shall be designed for each street of the subdivision to
the satisfaction of the Board and shall be so laid out and of sufficient size to permit
unimpeded flow of all natural waterways, to provide adequate drainage of all portions of
the street system so that water does not accumulate thereon, to intercept storm water
runoff from the adjacent lots of the subdivision, and to eliminate undesirable or unnatural
accumulation of water on any portion of the subdivision or surrounding property, and to
be completely compatible with the existing town municipal services and waterways.
Those conditions which result from a twenty-five (25) year storm shall be assumed as a
basis for design of the street drains. The storm drain system shall include gutters, catch
basins, manholes, culverts, drain lines, concrete headwalls and such other items as may
be required to complete the system to the satisfaction of the Board.
(1) Catch basins shall be located in pairs, one on each side of the roadway, at
all low points or sag curves in the roadway, at intervals of not more than three
hundred (300) feet on continuous grades of the roadway, at or near the corners
of the roadway at intersecting streets, and at the end of turnarounds. Invert and
frame elevations shall be shown.
(2) Manholes shall be located at all changes in direction, either horizontally or
vertically, of a drain line or at the intersection of two (2) or more drain lines, or
so located that no drain line greater than five hundred (500) feet in length would
exist without either a catch basin or manhole. Invert and frame elevations shall
be shown.
(3) At least one leaching basin shall be annexed to each pair of catch basins
proposed. Leaching basins shall be placed in accordance with the above
Sections 4.06a and 4.06b and shall conform to the specifications contained
within Section 5.06. (See Appendix A, Plate No. 12)
(4) All roadway drain pipes shall be a minimum of ten (10) inches in diameter
and be laid on a slope of not less than one-half of one (0.5) percent. The
31
designed maximum velocity shall not exceed twelve (12) feet per second. All
outfalls shall extend to, and be compatible with, either a natural waterway or an
existing drainage system. The ground elevation of all outfall pipes, swales,
channels or drainage ditches discharging to a stream, brook, pond, marsh or
other wetland, should be 0.5 to 1 foot above mean water elevation, or at higher
elevations if required by the Planning Board because of special local situations
based on consultation with the Conservation Commission. Provision shall be
made for the disposal of surface water intercepted or collected by the system in
such a manner that no flow is conducted over Town ways above grade, or over
the land of others unless a drainage easement is obtained. Where adjacent
property is not subdivided, provision shall be made for extensions of the system
by continuing appropriate drains to the boundary of the subdivision at such size
and grade as will allow their proper projection.
(5) Gas and oil separators shall be installed as required by the Planning Board.
(See Appendix A, Plate 13)
(6) Drainage systems within the Public Wellhead Recharge District (as
designated in §139-12B of the Nantucket Zoning Bylaw) shall be designed in
conformance with the publication entitled Artificial Recharge: Evaluation and
Guidance to Municipalities: A Guide to Stormwater Infiltration Practices
in Public Water Supply Areas of Massachusetts, prepared by the Pioneer
Valley Planning Commission.
4.06c Open Drainage Systems
Open drainage systems of swales, ridges, and slopes shall be designed to fit the natural
contour of the land as much as possible. Disturbed land shall be landscaped to conform
to the surrounding area and planted to eliminate the possibility of erosion and siltation.
In no case shall side slopes in disturbed areas be greater than twenty-five (25) percent.
Swales and drainage channels shall have a minimum grade of one half of one (0.5)
percent and a maximum grade of five (5) percent, although for small areas draining not
more than one-half (0.5) acre, grades of up to ten (10) percent are permissible. The
ground shall be sloped so that there is no stagnant water or artificial pools on the site
attributable to the open drainage system. Drainage channels and swales shall be
provided with easements which shall also permit access by the Town of Nantucket for
maintenance purposes. Easements shall conform to Section 4.07 of these Rules and
Regulations. Drainage channels and swales shall be shown on all plans.
Where the Planning Board determines that the public interest and best interest of the
Town and the subdivision will be served by extension of the drainage system outside the
boundaries of the subdivision, the Planning Board may require the Applicant, at his own
expense, to continue the layout and construction of the drainage system to a point
outside the boundaries of the subdivision where the drainage system may be connected
to, and be compatible with, either a natural waterway or an existing public drainage
system.
4.07 EASEMENTS
32
Easements for utilities, bicycle paths and pedestrian paths outside of street rights-of way shall
be provided and recorded as required and shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide for water
mains, sanitary sewers and storm drains, ten (10) feet wide for underground electrical,
telephone and cable TV lines, and fifteen (15) feet wide for bicycle and pedestrian paths. Slope
easements and site and/or scenic easements may be required where deemed necessary. Where
a subdivision is transversed by a water course, drainage way, channel, other stream or wetland,
the Board may require the provision of an easement of adequate width to conform substantially
to the line of such water course, drainage way, channel, stream or wetland and to provide for
the possibility of flood, protection of banks, future maintenance or construction and other
necessary purposes.
4.08 ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE SITE
No subdivision shall be approved which does not have adequate access to the site. The
applicant shall show to the satisfaction of the Board:
(a) Adequate vehicular access to the subdivision has been provided by a way, or ways,
having sufficient width, suitable grades and adequate construction to provide for
vehicular traffic and to ensure direct ingress and a rapid response time for emergency
vehicles. The Board may require that secondary access be provided for reasons of
public safety and convenience. Said vehicular access shall meet the Town's
Specifications for paved roads described in Section 5. Access roads may, at a
minimum, meet the Town’s specification for Stabilized Gravel Roads (see Appendix A)
provided that the maximum number of lots permitted under current zoning density
requirements does not exceed six lots.
(b) Adequate utility access from existing utility lines to the subdivision designed to
deliver underground electrical and telephone service to serve the land and buildings
erected or to be erected thereon.
(c) The legal right to pass and repass over such access way or ways and the legal right
to install underground utilities in the proposed location.
4.09 SHOULDERS
Pitched shoulders shall extend 4 feet immediately outside the treated surface, and the slopes
joining sideline of right-of-way to natural grade shall not be steeper than two (2) horizontal to
one (1) vertical.
The four (4) foot shoulder shall be spread with four (4) inches of loam, and seeded with grass
seed. The remaining area disturbed during the construction program shall be cleared of rocks,
stones, or other debris and also spread with four (4) inches of loam, and seeded with grass
seed. The plane of the loam on the strip between the sideline of right-of-way and the shoulder
shall be two (2) inches above the plane of the loam and the seeded shoulder. (See Appendix
A, Plate No. 5 for typical cross-section)
33
4.10 GUARD RAILS AND POSTS
Guard rails or posts shall be installed where necessary.
4.11 STREET SIGNS
Street signs conforming in design to the pattern in use by the Town and bearing the names of the
intersecting streets as indicated on the Definitive Plan shall be installed at all intersections of
streets in the subdivision. Street sign design shall be subject to the approval of the Historic
District Commission. Street names shall appear on both sides of the sign if placed on a post.
4.12 WATER PIPES AND RELATED EQUIPMENT
Water pipes and related equipment such as hydrants, main shut-offs and laterals, including shutoffs,
to serve each lot in the subdivision shall be constructed in accordance with the regulations
and requirements of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Nantucket Fire
Department, and, where applicable, the local municipal or private water company. All water
lines shall be offered for acceptance to the local municipal water company. A central water
supply for more than six (6) units must be approved by the State Department of Public Health
and Public Utilities.
4.13 DRY SEWER LINES
Dry sewer lines shall be installed to service all lots in the subdivision with laterals running to the
low points of the property line. Sewer lines and related equipment shall be constructed in
accordance with the following specifications.
4.13a Minimum velocity - 2 feet per second;
4.13b Design flow - 750 gallons per day per lot;
4.13c Tight joint pipe;
4.13d Lift stations and treatment plant to be approved by the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health and the Nantucket Department of Public Works.
4.14 POWER LINES
Power lines shall be placed underground in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
Nantucket Electric Company, provided that they are no less stringent than the Massachusetts
Department of Public Utilities regulations. A letter from the Nantucket Electric Company shall
be submitted stating that a person qualified to do so and acting on behalf of the Nantucket
Electric Company has reviewed the proposed power line installation and that said installation
meets with their approval.
All lines shall be placed in conduits in all locations where these lines pass under roadway
surfaces. A flag shall be erected to mark each conduit location.
4.15 TELEPHONE POLES
34
All telephone lines shall be placed underground in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the New England Telephone Company. A letter from the Telephone Company addressed to
the Nantucket Planning Board shall be submitted stating that a person qualified to do so and
acting on behalf of the New England Telephone Company has reviewed the proposed
telephone installation and that said installation meets with their approval.
All lines shall be placed in conduits in all locations where these lines pass under roadway
surfaces. A flag shall be erected to mark each conduit location.
4.16 LANDSCAPING
A landscape plan shall be presented as part of each subdivision plan. This plan shall clearly
show:
l the location and size of all proposed trees and other plantings; and
l the location and size of all existing trees and other vegetation on the site which is to
be preserved.
The following standards shall apply:
(1) Existing vegetation shall be preserved wherever possible on every site. All existing
trees over three (3) inch caliper, as well as any tree which has been flagged by the
Planning Board or its designee, shall be shown on the landscape plan.
(2) New trees shall be planted on subdivision lots in order to provide shade, visual-and
wind-screening, habitat for birds and other wildlife, and visual amenity for future
residents. Planting requirements for new trees and other vegetation shall be determined
according to zoning and the density of the proposed subdivision. In general, the
following guidelines shall apply:
