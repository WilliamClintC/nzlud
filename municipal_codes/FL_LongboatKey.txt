PREFACE 
    The Longboat Key, Florida Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by American Legal Publishing Co. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, Chapter and Section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List". 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2019-02, passed March 4, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the town as accessible as possible to town officials, town employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    A secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein". 
    This table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)", "(Pending)", "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)". 
    This table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List". 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    A Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this Code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. When new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System." (Example: 31, 32, 32.1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in Codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your Code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

LONGBOAT KEY CHARTER 
    The town's original Charter was derived from Special Acts 1957, Ch. 1540, and Special Acts, Chs. 59-1511, 59-1512, 61-2422, 65-1862, and 69-1265. On February 19, 1975, the Town Commission adopted Ordinance 75-2, which provided for a new Charter (sometimes referred to as the 1975 Charter) that was approved by the town's voters on March 20, 1975. On September 21, 1989, the Town Commission adopted Ordinance 89-15, which provided for 14 Charter amendments, and that was approved by the town's voters on November 7, 1989. The 1975 Charter was further amended by the town's voters on March 17, 1998, when they approved the Town Commission's January 5, 1998, enactment of Ordinance 97-28. Later that same year, on December 17, 1998, the Town Commission adopted Ordinance 98-32, which provided for a new Charter (sometimes referred to as the 1999 Charter) that was approved by the town's voters on March 9, 1999, with a single exception. On January 7, 2008, the Town Commission adopted Ordinance 2007-52, which amended the 1999 Charter, and that was approved by the town's voters on March 18, 2008. On December 4, 2017, the Town Commission adopted Ordinance 2017-23, which amended the 2008 Charter, and that was approved by the town's voters on March 20, 2018. 
    Note: For all up-to-date amendments to the Charter, see the "Charter Comparative Table" located at the end of this Charter. 
Article I. - Boundaries, Powers, and Form of Government 

Sec. 1. - Purpose. 
    We, the people of the Town of Longboat Key, desiring to avail ourselves of the right to establish a home rule charter form of government do, in accordance with the Constitution and the Laws of the State of Florida, ordain and establish this Charter and form of government for the Town of Longboat Key, Florida. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 2. - Body corporate and politic. 
    The inhabitants of the Town of Longboat Key, Florida, as its boundaries are established pursuant to Article I, Section 3, shall be and continue to be a body politic and corporate to be known and designated as the "Town of Longboat Key," and as such shall have perpetual succession. The use of any word importing male gender within this Charter shall extend and be applied to both male and female. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 3. - Boundaries. 
    The corporate boundaries of the Town shall be established by ordinance and shall remain fixed as existing on the date this Charter takes effect. The Town shall have the power to change its boundaries in the manner prescribed by law. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 4. - Form of government. 
    The form of government established under this Charter shall be a "commission-manager" form as herein defined. The commission shall consist of seven (7) electors to be nominated and elected as hereinafter provided. The commission shall constitute the governing body of the town, with the duties and responsibilities hereinafter provided, and shall appoint a chief administrative officer to be known as "town manager" to exercise all the powers, perform the duties, and assume the responsibilities hereinafter provided. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 5. - Powers of municipality. 
    In accordance with the Constitution and the Statutes of the State of Florida, the Town of Longboat Key shall have all governmental, corporate, and proprietary powers to enable it to conduct municipal government, perform municipal functions, and render municipal services, and it may exercise any of its powers for municipal purposes, except when expressly prohibited by law, provided: 
(a)  The town shall not sell any real property owned by the town unless the town commission first determines that such real property may not be needed for current or future municipal use, and not less than thirty (30) days prior to sale, causes a notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the town giving notice of its intention to sell. 
(b)  The town or any public entity controlled by the town may issue general obligation bonds payable from ad valorem taxation and maturing more than twelve months after issuance only to finance or refinance capital projects authorized by law and only when approved by vote of the electors who are qualified to vote pursuant to Article VII, Section 12, of the Florida Constitution. 
(c)  The town or any public entity controlled by the town may issue revenue bonds in excess of the Bonding Limitation at any one time only when approved by vote of the qualified electors. For purposes of this limitation, "at any one time" means within 90 days and "Bonding Limitation" means $5,000,000.00 initially. As of each October 1 thereafter, the amount of the "Bonding Limitation" in effect shall be adjusted to reflect the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (U.S. City Average All Workers) by using the most recent available information for the prior 12 month period. The town commission may waive the requirement in this Section 5(c) for a vote of the electors for said revenue bonds if it determines, in its sole discretion, that there exists an emergency such that it is in the best interest of the town to issue the bonds without a vote of the electors. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the above, a vote of the electors shall not be required to refund outstanding bonds and interest and redemption premium thereon at a lower net average interest cost rate, to issue any revenue bonds payable exclusively from non-ad valorem revenues in the proprietary funds, or to incur any obligation which is subject to annual appropriation. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 6. - Powers of town commission. 
(a)  All powers of the Town of Longboat Key, except those vested in the town manager, town clerk, and town attorney, or as otherwise provided in this Charter, are vested in the town commission. The town commission may prescribe by ordinance or resolution the manner in which such powers are exercised. The town commission shall have power to pass all ordinances and laws not inconsistent with the Constitution and the Laws of the United States and the State of Florida as in its judgment may be necessary and proper for the government and preservation of peace and order within the town. 
(b)  The town commission shall have the power to impose by ordinance such fines, penalties, and forfeitures as it deems necessary for the enforcement of ordinances of the town.

(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Article II. - Town Commission 

Sec. 1. - Commission districts. 
    There are hereby created five (5) commission districts in the Town of Longboat Key as presently established by ordinance of the town. All district boundaries shall run as nearly as possible along lot lines or street lines and as nearly as possible in an east-west direction. All districts shall have substantially an equal number of electors registered therein. The town commission shall, by ordinance, redistrict the town within six (6) months after the general election held in March if the number of registered electors in any district exceeds by twenty percent (20%) the number of registered electors in any other district in order that all districts may have substantially an equal number of electors registered therein; provided that final action in any redistricting ordinance shall be completed by the commission at least sixty (60) days prior to any special, preliminary, or general election. A district boundary shall not run through a residential structure, and all residential structures shall lie wholly within one district or another. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 2. - Creation of commission; residency requirements, election, and terms of office of commissioners. 
(a)  The town commission shall consist of seven (7) electors of the town. Two (2) commissioners shall be elected at large. The remaining five (5) commissioners shall reside in and be nominated from each of the five districts of the town as set forth in Section 1. Commissioners shall be elected by the qualified electors residing in all five districts at a general election. Until the March 2020 general election, commissioners shall hold office for a two (2) year term beginning on the day of the certification of the election. Until the March 2020 general election, one (1) commissioner-at-large and commissioners from odd-numbered districts shall be elected in even-numbered years. Until the March 2021 general election, one (1) commissioner-at-large and commissioners from even-numbered districts shall be elected in odd-numbered years. 
(b)  Commencing with the March 2020 general election and continuing thereafter, commissioners from odd-numbered districts shall be elected to hold office for a three (3) year term beginning on the date of the certification of the election. Commencing with the March 2020 general election one at large commissioner shall be elected at the March 2020 general election for a two (2) year term beginning on the date of certification of that election. At the conclusion of that at-large commissioner's two (2) year term, commencing with the March 2022 general election and continuing every three (3) years thereafter, a commissioner elected to that at-large seat shall be elected to hold office for a three (3) year term beginning on the date of certification of the election. 
(c)  Commencing with the March 2021 general election and continuing thereafter commissioners from even-numbered districts shall be elected to hold office for a three (3) year term beginning on the date of certification of the election. Commencing with the March 2021 general election one at large commissioner shall be elected at the March 2021 general election for a one (1) year term beginning on the date of certification of that election. At the conclusion of that at-large commissioner's one (1) year term, commencing with the March 2022 general election and continuing every three (3) years thereafter, a commissioner elected to that at-large seat shall be elected to hold office for a three (3) year term beginning on the date of certification of the election. 
(d)  Except as specifically permitted in subsection (e) below, no elector shall serve more than six (6) consecutive years as a town commissioner without an interval of twenty-four months out of office. Except as specifically permitted in subsection (e), service of more than twenty-four months as town commissioner shall be considered a term for the purposes of the consecutive term limitation. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the consecutive term limits provided herein, due to the transition in commission seat term lengths from two (2) year to three (3) year terms of office and the staggering of elections for commission seats, commissioners that were elected during the March 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 general elections, may serve a maximum of eight (8) consecutive years as a commissioner as measured from the date of their certification of the election for their initial term of office or their swearing into the office, as applicable, as long as the consecutive terms do not exceed a maximum of eight (8) years in office. 
(f)  Any commissioner, except those elected at large, who changes his or her permanent residence to an area outside the district from which elected shall be deemed to have vacated the office and position on the town commission. Any commissioner who is redistricted during the course of their term by ordinance as required by Section 1 of this Article, shall continue to hold office for that district until the expiration of the term. 
(Ord. No. 2010-18, § 5, adopted 12-6-10, effective 3-15-11; Ord. 2017-23, Exh. A, 12-4-17; Ord. No. 2018-18, § 3, passed 11-5-18) 
Sec. 3. - Nominations; character of service. 
    The town commission shall provide by ordinance for procedures for nominations for the office of town commissioner, provided all nominations and elections shall be conducted on a nonpartisan basis without regard for a designation of the political party affiliation of any nominee on any nominating petition or ballot. All members of the town commission shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with official duties. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 4. - Elections generally. 
    When there are more than two (2) qualified candidates for an elective office on the town commission, there shall be both a preliminary and general election. The preliminary election shall be held on the last Tuesday of January and the general election shall be held on the third Tuesday of March, or, when practicable, in conjunction with any County administered election held in March by the coordinating County, either Sarasota or Manatee County. If the date of the general election is changed as a result of coordinating with a County, the date of the preliminary election may also be changed in order to comply with State election laws. The names of the first and second highest number of votes cast for a particular office in the preliminary election shall be placed on the ballot for that office at the general election. If no more than two (2) electors qualify as candidates for nomination for each office to be voted upon, then no preliminary election need be held; and such qualified candidates shall be nominees at the next following general election. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 5. - Conduct of elections. 
    The town commission shall, by ordinance, prescribe the method and manner of holding all elections in the town and shall provide when and how special elections shall be called and held, subject to the agreement and consent of the Sarasota and Manatee County Supervisors of Elections. Either County Supervisor of Election may conduct and oversee a town-wide election in accordance with applicable Florida Statutes. All elections shall be conducted substantially in accordance with the laws governing state elections insofar as there is no conflict with the terms of the Charter. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17)

    The polls shall be open at the voting places from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., or as otherwise provided by law, on the same day, and the time shall be regulated by the customary time in standard use in the Town of Longboat Key on the date of the particular election. The result of the voting, when ascertained, shall be certified by the Supervisor of Elections or his deputy and delivered to the town clerk who shall transmit the returns to the town commission at a meeting to be held within three (3) business days following certification. At such meeting, the town commission shall canvass the returns and the result as shown by such returns shall be declared by the commission to be the result of the election. The town clerk shall thereupon furnish a certificate of election to each person shown to have been elected, and each such person shall take office at that meeting. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 7. - Judge of qualifications. 
    The town commission shall be the judge of the election and qualification of its own members, subject to review by the courts. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 8. - Vacancies. 
(a)  Vacancies in the town commission shall be filled by the town commission, with any person so appointed to be a qualified elector from the district of the vacated commissioner, to serve until the next general municipal election. At the next general municipal election, the vacancy shall be filled by election; the person elected in such election to serve the remaining unexpired term of the town commissioner whose vacant office is being filled. If a vacancy is not filled by the town commission within thirty (30) days after the vacancy occurs, a special election shall be held, as authorized by the Supervisor of Elections, after such a vacancy occurs; and the person so elected shall serve the remaining unexpired term. 
(b)  Any vacancy resulting from a recall election shall be filled in the manner provided by state laws applicable to recall of municipal officials. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 9. - Recall of town commissioners. 
    All members of the town commission shall be subject to recall as provided by the Laws of the State of Florida. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 10. - Mayor and vice-mayor. 
(a)  The town commission shall, at a meeting to be held annually in March of each year elect one (1) of its members as mayor of the town and another of its members as vice-mayor. In the event a vacancy occurs in the office of mayor, the vice-mayor shall immediately assume the duties of the mayor for the remainder of the mayor's unexpired term. In the event a vacancy occurs in the office of vice-mayor, the town commission shall elect a new vice-mayor at the next available town commission meeting for the remainder of mayor's unexpired term. If the members of the town commission are unable to agree upon the selection of the mayor or vice-mayor within 15 days after a vacancy occurs, then such vacant office shall be chosen by lot, conducted by the town attorney, who shall certify the result of such lot in the minutes of the town commission. 
(b)  In the event of illness, disability, death, or absence of the mayor, the vice-mayor shall have all powers, duties, and authority of the mayor. If the vice-mayor signs any instrument in place of the mayor, then it shall be presumed without further proof that the mayor was either ill, disabled, deceased, or absent from the town. In the event of the illness, disability, death, or absence from the town of both the mayor and vice-mayor, a quorum of the town commission may by resolution, entered in the minutes of the town commission, appoint an acting mayor for such length of time or for such particular purpose as may be necessary. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 11. - Functions and powers of mayor. 
    The mayor shall preside at all meetings of the commission and perform such other duties consistent with the office as may be imposed by it, shall have a voice and a vote in the proceedings of the commission but no veto power, and may use the title of mayor in any case in which the execution of legal instruments or other necessity arising under the general laws of the state so requires. This shall not be considered as conferring upon the mayor the administrative or judicial functions of a mayor under the general laws of the state. The mayor shall be recognized as the official head of the town by the courts for the purpose of serving civil pro-cesses, by the government in the exercise of military law, and for all ceremonial purposes. The powers and duties of the mayor shall be such as are conferred by the town commission in pursuance of the provisions of this Charter, and no others. 
(Ord. 2017-23, adopted 12-4-17) 
Sec. 12. - Relationship of town commission with administration. 
(a)  Except for purposes of inquiry, the town commission and its members shall deal with the administrative service solely through the town manager.

33.06 - Enforcement procedure. 
(A)  The enforcement procedures provided for in sections 33.06 through 33.13 of this chapter are adopted pursuant to the authority provided for in the Local Government Code Enforcement Boards Act, as codified in F.S. §§ 162.01-162.13, as may be amended from time to time.

No member of the code enforcement board shall have the power to initiate code enforcement proceedings. 
(C)  Except as provided in subsection (D) of this section and subsection 33.07(A) below, if a violation of the codes is found, the code enforcement officer shall notify the violator in writing as provided in section 33.12 and give him or her a reasonable time to correct the violation which shall not exceed 30 days. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code enforcement officer may notify the code enforcement board or special magistrate and request a hearing, or issue a citation as provided in section 33.17. Town staff shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of such hearing shall be hand delivered or mailed as provided in section 33.12 to the violator. Notice may additionally be served by publication or posting as provided in section 33.12. If the violation is corrected and then recurs, or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code enforcement officer, the case may be presented to the code enforcement board or special magistrate even if the violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing and the notice shall so state. 
(D)  If the code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation, presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the code enforcement board or special magistrate and request a hearing. Fines and liens may be imposed as provided in section 33.10. 
(Ord. 86-30, passed 10-6-86; Amd. Ord. 88-16, passed 5-2-88; Amd. Ord. 89-21, passed 11-6-89; Ord. 93-12, passed 6-24-93; Amd. Ord. 94-21, passed 10-3-94; Ord. 2010-10, passed 4-5-10; Ord. 2018-03, passed 6-4-18; Ord. 2018-13, passed 10-15-18) 
33.07 - Repeat violations and property transfers. 
(A)  If a repeat violation is found, the code enforcement officer shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code enforcement officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation as provided in section 33.12, shall notify the code enforcement board or special magistrate and request a hearing. The code enforcement board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice pursuant to section 33.12. The case may be presented to the code enforcement board or special magistrate even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the code enforcement board or special magistrate retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the code enforcement board or special magistrate. 
(B)  If the owner of property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before the code enforcement board or special magistrate transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement officer of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
    A failure to make the disclosures described in subsection (B), before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(Ord. 2018-03, passed 6-4-18) 
33.08 - Hearings. 
(A)  Special magistrate and code enforcement board hearings shall be scheduled as needed by the town. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings by the board and special magistrate, and all hearings and proceedings shall be open to the public. The town shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required by the board or special magistrate for proper performance of its duties. Each case before the board or special magistrate shall be presented by a member of the administrative staff of the town, as designated by the town manager. If the local governing body prevails in prosecuting a case, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the board and such costs may be included in the lien authorized by section 33.10. 
(B)  The board or special magistrate shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The board or special magistrate shall take testimony from the code enforcement officer and from the alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and govern the proceedings. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board or special magistrate shall issue findings of fact based on evidence of record, and conclusions of law and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted herein and under applicable Florida law. The finding of the board shall be by motion approved by a majority of those present and voting; however, at least four members of the board must vote for the action to be official. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date, and that a fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by said date, and under the conditions specified in subsection 33.06(C), the cost of repairs may be included along with the fine. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the finding therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the violator comes into compliance as verified by the code enforcement officer, an affidavit of compliance shall be executed and recorded in the public records acknowledging the same. A hearing is not required to issue an affidavit of compliance.

33.10 - Administrative fines and lien. 
(A)  The code enforcement board or special magistrate, upon notification by the code enforcement officer that a code enforcement order has not been complied with by the set time or, upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set in the order or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code enforcement officer. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in subsection 33.06(D), the code enforcement board or special magistrate shall notify the local governing body, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not constitute a continuing obligation on the part of the town to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the town for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this section, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, the code enforcement board or special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable and irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (B) below. 
(B)  (1)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (A) above. However, if the code enforcement board or special magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
(2)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the code enforcement board or special magistrate shall consider the following factors: 
(a)  The gravity of the violation; 
(b)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violations; and 
(c)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(C)  The code enforcement board or special magistrate may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. The reduction of a fine previously imposed by a code enforcement order and recorded as a lien may occur under the following conditions: 
(1)  No fine reduction shall be considered where the property owner appealed an order imposing fine to the court and the town prevailed. 
(2)  A written application shall be filed with the town clerk with a filing fee of $50.00. 
(3)  The written application shall state the grounds and factual basis for the fine reduction. 
(4)  The clerk for code enforcement proceedings shall prepare a record of the hearing at which the fine was imposed including minutes of the proceeding and a copy of all documents that were part of the proceedings. A copy of the record shall be provided to the applicant and to the board or special magistrate. 
(5)  The applicant is responsible for making a verbatim record of the testimony and evidence of the meeting upon which any appeal is based. 
(6)  The reduction hearing shall be open to the public. 
(7)  In reviewing the amount of a fine, the board or special magistrate shall consider the gravity of the violation, the actions taken by the violator to correct the violation and any previous or current violations committed by the violator. 
(8)  The grounds for reducing a fine shall be limited to errors in the record, newly discovered evidence, misconduct, mistake, surprise, excusable neglect or substantial financial hardship. Consideration shall be given to how much time has elapsed since the order imposing fine was entered. 
(9)  The burden shall be on the applicant to prove the grounds for a fine reduction. 
(10)  A decision shall be made after the hearing and written order shall be entered. 
(11)  The decision of the board or special magistrate to reduce or not to reduce a fine shall be final. 
(D)  A certified copy of an order imposing the fine, or a fine plus repair costs, provided for herein may be recorded in the public records of the county, and thereafter such order shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator in the State of Florida. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. 
(E)  After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the code enforcement board or special magistrate may recommend to the town commission that the town attorney foreclose on the lien or sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus accrued interest. Actions for money judgments under this chapter may be pursued only on fines levied after October 1, 2000. 
(F)  No lien created pursuant to this chapter may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Article X, Section 4, of the state Constitution. The money judgment provisions of this section shall not apply to real property or personal property which is covered under Article X, Section 4(a), of the state Constitution. 
(G)  No lien provided by this section shall continue for a longer period than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The local governing body shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the local governing body and the local governing body may execute a satisfaction or release of lien pursuant to this section. 
(H)  All liens created by this chapter shall be a first lien equal to a lien for nonpayment of property taxes or special assessments on the property against which the code enforcement action was brought, and shall continue in full force and effect from the date of recordation until discharged by satisfaction. Upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator, the priority of the lien shall be determined by the date of recordation of the lien.

33.11 - Appeals. 
    An aggrieved party, including the town, may appeal a final administrative order of the code enforcement board or special magistrate to the circuit court. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. The scope of review shall be limited to the record made before the board or special magistrate and shall not be a trial de novo. The board or special magistrate shall by rule establish reasonable charges for the preparation of the record to be paid by the petitioner. 
(Ord. 86-30, passed 10-6-86; Amd. Ord. 89-21, passed 11-6-89; Ord. 2018-03, passed 6-4-18)

(2)  By hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code enforcement officer, or other person designated by the local governing body; or 
(3)  By leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice; or 
(4)  In the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. 
(B)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (A), at the option of the code enforcement board or special magistrate, notice may also be served by publication or posting as follows: 
(1)  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the violation is located. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50, for legal and official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 50.051. 
(C)  (1)  In lieu of publication as prescribed in subsection (B) above, such notice may be posted at least ten days prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at the government office for the Town of Longboat Key, located at 501 Bay Isles Road where public notices are commonly posted. 
(2)  Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of the system: 
(A)  The accrued benefits of all members of this system who are employed and not participating in the DROP on February 1, 2014, shall be frozen on that date. All members shall be fully vested in their frozen accrued benefit. The value of each member's frozen accrued benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the system in effect on January 25, 2014, based on the member's credited service and average final compensation on that date. The frozen accrued benefit shall be payable to the member upon termination of town employment and attaining age 55 with ten years of credited service, 25 years of credited service regardless of age, or age 60 regardless of years of credited service, whichever occurs first.

(B)  No benefits shall be accrued under this system on or after February 1, 2014, and no member contributions to this system shall be required on or after that date.

(D)  Effective February 1, 2014, all current and future police officers of the Town of Longboat Key shall participate in a defined contribution retirement plan established by the Town of Longboat Key, and shall be eligible for benefits and make contributions to the defined contribution plan for all service as a police officer with the town on and after that date, in accordance with the defined contribution plan, as it may be amended from time to time.

For the purpose of determining the actuarial present value of the frozen accrued benefit, such benefit shall include the lesser of the amount of leave accrued as of July 5, 2016, or the amount of accrued leave that would have been included in the member's salary if the member retired prior to February 1, 2014.

(A)  As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    "Accumulated contributions" means a member's own contributions without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    "Actuarial equivalent" means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Table and an interest rate of 7.5 percent per annum. This definition may only be amended by the town pursuant to the recommendation of the board using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to town discretion. 
    "Average final compensation" means one-twelfth of the average salary of the five best years of the last ten years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time police officer, whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
    "Beneficiary" means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    "Board" means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund.

A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the police department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a police officer, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a police officer with the police department within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within 90 days after his reemployment. 
    The years or fractional parts of a year that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L. 103-353), after separation from employment as a police officer with the town to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of the USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a police officer within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five years. 
(4)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Code § 414(u)(12), an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Code § 3401(h)(2)) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Code § 415(c). This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    "DROP" means the Town of Longboat Key Police Officers' Retirement System Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
    "DROP account" means the account established for each DROP participant under subsection (B).

The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise early or normal retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary.

This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary.

(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died.

(Ord. 2010-05, passed 3-1-10) 
34.20 - Disability. 
(A)  Disability benefits in-line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to 3.5 percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 42 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the town for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(B)  In-line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease, shall be presumed to have been suffered in-line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subsection (2), shall apply only to those conditions described in this subsection (2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (B) (2), the following definitions apply: 
1.  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
2.  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed full-time by the town as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
3.  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
4.  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
(i)  Provides emergency medical treatment in a nonhealth care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
(ii)  At the site of an accident, fire or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
(iii)  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
(iv)  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
5.  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
(i)  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
(ii)  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
(iii)  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
(iv)  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the town to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The town shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the town of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This subsection does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(C)  Disability benefits not-in-line of duty. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to 3.5 percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the town for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(D)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained by the member after his employment as a police officer with the Town of Longboat Key shall have terminated. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the town and arising out of such employment. 
(E)  Physical examination requirement. 
(1)  A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
(2)  Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of the ordinance from which this section derives may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the town that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
(3)  The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
(4)  If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the town as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the town will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
(5)  The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(F)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
    Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsections 34.22(A)(1) or (A)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(Ord. 2010-05, passed 3-1-10) 
34.21 - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a police officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(A)  If the member has less than five years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(B)  If the member has five or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit or, if elected, an optional form of benefit as provided for in subsection 34.22(A)(4), determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, and in accordance with the following vesting schedule:

    The benefits shall be payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
(Ord. 2010-05, passed 3-1-10) 
34.22 - Optional forms of benefits. 
(A)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury Regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a) (9)-6.) 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(4)  A lump sum amount, however, the board shall not approve a request for a lump sum distribution to any member, joint pensioner or beneficiary of a member who was hired after April 1, 1992 in an amount in excess of $5,000.00. 
(B)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (A)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. 
(C)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(D)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 34.23. 
(E)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 34.19. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (A), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 34.23. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection 34.18(A), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the town. 
(F)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(G)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. 2010-05, passed 3-1-10) 
34.23 - Beneficiaries. 
(A)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(B)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (A), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(C)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder.

(Ord. 2010-05, passed 3-1-10) 
34.27 - Maximum pension. 
(A)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code § 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code § 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code § 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code § 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code § 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code § 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code § 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(B)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (A), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code § 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulations § 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Code § 417(e)(3) does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption), and: (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulations § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62); and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Code § 417(e)(3)(B) (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Code § 417(e)(3)(B)); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Code § 417(e)(3) applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5 percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption); and: (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulations § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Code § 417(e)(3)(B) (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Code § 417(e)(3)(B)); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulations § 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)); and: (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulations § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Code § 417(e)(3)(B) (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Code § 417(e)(3)(B)), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(C)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under Code § 415(b)(2) and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code § 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(D)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code § 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code § 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code § 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code § 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code § 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Code § 415(b) and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(E)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code § 415(b), so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the town, the adjustments provided for in subsection (E)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (E)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 34.20, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 34.19. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (A) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(F)  Less than ten years of participation or service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the town shall be the amount determined under subsection (A) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 34.20, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 34.19. 
(G)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code § 414(j) maintained by the town shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all town defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(H)  Ten thousand dollar limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 34.27, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (H) of section 34.27 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the town contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the town has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the town, the limit under this subsection (H) of section 34.27 shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(I)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans; provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(J)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 34.38 and 34.39, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Code § 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code § 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of Code § 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code § 415(c). 
    For purposes of applying subsection (J)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code § 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection, and for purposes of applying subsection (J)(1)b., the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Code § 415(c)(1)(B) solely by reason of this subsection. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
    Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding the clause of subsection (J)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(K)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the Code § 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (K), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations § 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations § 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code § 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code §§ 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code § 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code § 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code §§ 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code § 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations § 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code § 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code §§ 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (K)(2)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code § 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Code § 415(c), the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (K) shall not exceed the annual limit under Code § 401(a)(17). 
(L)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to Social Security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code.

(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code § 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code § 414(d).

(B)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date, which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the town. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (B)(2), other than subsection (B)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
    For purposes of this subsection (B)(2) and subsection (E), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (B)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (B)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (B)(2)a.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of § 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in § 414(k) of the Code, will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of § 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(C)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to sections 34.18, 34.19, 34.21 or 34.22, (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 34.19) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.

(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Code § 401(a) (9) (G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation § 1.401(a) (9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Code § 401(a) (9) (G) and Treasury Regulation § 1.401-1(b) (1) (I), or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(E)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under § 40l(a) (9) of the Code and § 1.401(a) (9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury Regulations.

Editor's note- Ord. 2014-01, adopted Jan. 6, 2014 does not specifically amend this Code of Ordinances, but does state the following: Any and all previously adopted ordinances and resolutions imposing the premium tax authorized by F.S. § 185.08, or otherwise providing for participation under F.S. ch. 185, are hereby rescinded and repealed. Notwithstanding any provision of the Town Code of Ordinances to the contrary, the Town of Longboat Key hereby withdraws from participation under F.S. ch. 185, pursuant to F.S. § 185.60. 
34.30 - Repeal or termination of system. 
(A)  The ordinance codified in this subchapter establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(B)  If the ordinance codified in this subchapter shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this subchapter who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(C)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the police officer's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the police officer. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3). 
    If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

(Ord. 2010-05, passed 3-1-10) 
34.36 - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(A)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  "Eligible rollover distribution." An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under § 401(a) (9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income, as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in § 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in § 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in § 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code § 401(a); or to an annuity contract described in Code § 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
b.  "Eligible retirement plan." An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in § 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in § 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in § 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in § 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in § 457(e) (1) (A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002; an annuity contract described in § 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in § 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in § 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. 
c.  "Distributee." A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code § 401(a) (9) (E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  "Direct rollover." A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(B)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in §§ 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code; from an annuity contract described in § 403(b) of the Code; or from an eligible plan under § 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in §§ 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(C)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

(A)  The member contributes to the fund an actuarially determined amount so that the crediting of the purchased service does not result in any cost to the fund, plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(B)  The request shall be made only once and made by the member on or before 18 months from the effective date of the ordinance adopting this section or 18 months from the date of his employment with the town police department, whichever is later.

(Ord. 2010-05, passed 3-1-10) 
34.40 - Deferred retirement option plan (DROP). 
(A)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a police officer, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system, may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP, provided that the election to participate in the DROP is made within six months following the date on which the member first becomes eligible for normal retirement. A member who fails to make the election within such six-month limitation period shall forfeit all rights to participate in the DROP. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, a member who, as of January 25, 2014, is within two years of the normal retirement date, may enter the DROP without penalty or enhancements on the first day of any month prior to February 1, 2014. Any member entering the DROP pursuant to this provision must execute a voluntary resignation irrevocable for any reason to be effective at the end of the member's participation in the DROP, and which provides that the member shall not be eligible for reemployment with the town, except at the exclusive option of the town. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least 15 business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP on or after June 6, 2011, under subsection (A)(2), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 36 months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the town not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (A)(3); or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection a. above, all amounts provided for in subsection (B) (2), including monthly benefits and investment earnings and losses or interest, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (C) when he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (A) (4), shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. For purposes of determining the accrued benefit, the member's salary for the purposes of calculating his average final compensation shall include an amount equal to any lump sum payments which would have been paid to the member and included as salary as defined herein, had the member retired under normal retirement and not elected DROP participation. Member contributions attributable to any lump sums used in the benefit calculation and not actually received by the member shall be deducted from the first payments to the member's DROP account. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system, nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits, except as provided for in section 34.41, Reemployment After Retirement. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a police officer, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a police officer. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a police officer. 
(B)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (B) (2), and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a police officer and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (A)(4)(b). A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (A)(3) and (A)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (A)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (2)b. shall be debited or credited after each fiscal year quarter with either: 
1.  Interest at an effective rate of 6.5 percent per annum compounded monthly on the prior month's ending balance; or 
2.  Earnings, determined as follows: 
    The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
    Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive either interest or earnings on his account to be determined as provided above. The member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter and prior to distribution. If a member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's 1st month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such nontransferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the police department and no cost-of-living adjustments shall be applied to the member's credit during such period of continued employment. A member employed by the police department after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits, nor will he accrue additional credited service, except as provided for in section 34.41, Reemployment After Retirement. 
(C)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (C), upon his termination of employment as a police officer. Except as provided in subsection (C)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a police officer. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a cash lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (C)(6). Elections under this subsection shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  Notwithstanding the preceding, if a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. 
a.  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (C), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of subsection (C), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 34.36. 
(D)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare and distribute to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including, but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board, nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(E)  General provisions. 
(1)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the town at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(2)  Facility of payment. If a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(3)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(4)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the town. If such person has not made written claim therefore within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the system, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the system. Upon such cancellation, the system shall have no further liability therefore except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(5)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP, shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States Mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States Mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(6)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the town, nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(7)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 34.40 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(8)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(9)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants. 
(Ord. 2010-05, passed 3-1-10; Ord. 2011-22, passed 6-6-11; Ord. 2014-03, passed 1-21-14) 
34.41 - Reemployment after retirement. 
(A)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the town, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the town shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(B)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a police officer and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period and not including any period of DROP participation), and credited service and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable as of the date of subsequent retirement. Upon reemployment, the member contribution rate for the reemployed retiree shall be the member contribution rate in effect for all members of the plan for the entire subsequent employment period. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(C)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the town in a position other than as a police officer, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment period. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
(D)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(E)  DROP participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment.

All members shall be fully vested in their frozen accrued benefit based on their length of service as of September 30, 2013. The value of each member's frozen accrued benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the system in effect on September 30, 2013, based on the member's credited service and average final compensation on that date. The frozen accrued benefit shall be payable to the member upon termination of town employment and attaining age 55 with ten years of credited service, 25 years of credited service regardless of age, or age 60 regardless of years of credited service, whichever occurs first. In applying the preceding sentence, credited service shall include all credited service as a member of this system prior to October 1, 2013, and all periods of employment as a full-time firefighter with the Town of Longboat Key on and after October 1, 2013. For the purpose of determining a member's frozen accrued benefit in accordance with this subsection (A), salary shall include any payments of accrued leave that would have been included in the member's salary if the member retired prior to October 1, 2013. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, upon separation from employment the amount of accrued leave included in a member's salary for the purpose of determining the member's frozen accrued benefit shall be the lesser of the amount of leave accrued at the time of separation from employment, or the amount of accrued leave that would have been included in the member's salary if the member retired prior to October 1, 2013, and the member's frozen accrued benefit shall be adjusted accordingly. 
(B)  No benefits shall be accrued under this system on or after October 1, 2013, and no member contributions to this system shall be required on or after that date. The town shall continue to make contributions to the system in accordance with subsection 34.47(C), and the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with sections 34.43 through 34.67, until all accrued benefits have been paid to all eligible members and beneficiaries. 
(C)  Any member of this system who is employed on September 30, 2013, and has less than ten years of credited service on that date may elect to receive a refund of their accumulated contributions or the actuarial present value of their frozen accrued benefit, in lieu of any other benefit under the system.

(E)  Members of this system who retired, entered the DROP or terminated town employment with the right to a deferred vested benefit prior to October 1, 2013, shall be entitled to receive benefits from the system in accordance with the provisions of the system in effect on the date of their retirement, DROP entry, or termination of employment. Members who retire or enter the DROP prior to October 1, 2013, shall not be eligible for reemployment with the town after that date, except at the exclusive option of the town. 
(F)  Effective July 5, 2016, any member of this system with the right to receive a deferred vested benefit who has not begun to receive a benefit may, on or before October 1, 2016, make a one-time irrevocable election on a form provided by the town to receive a refund of their accumulated contributions or the actuarial present value of their frozen accrued benefit, in lieu of any other benefit under the system. For the purpose of determining the actuarial present value of the frozen accrued benefit, such benefit shall include the lesser of the amount of leave accrued as of July 5, 2016, or the amount of accrued leave that would have been included in the member's salary if the member retired prior to October 1, 2013.

Member contributions withheld by the town on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to § 414(h) of the Code.

(B)  Deceased members eligible for early or normal retirement and who had five or more years of credited service. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was eligible for early or normal retirement and had five or more years of credited service, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  The beneficiary of a member whose death occurs after the member attained five or more years of credited service but who was not eligible for early or normal retirement shall be entitled to receive any accrued benefit payable to the member at the option of the beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for the benefit accrual rate provided in section 34.51, based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death. 
(2)  A beneficiary of a member whose death occurs after the member's eligibility for early or normal retirement shall be entitled to all benefits otherwise payable to the member. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  The board may elect to make an actuarial equivalent lump sum payment if the monthly retirement benefit is less than $100.00, or if the single sum value of the accrued retirement benefit is less than $5,000.00. 
(4)  A beneficiary may, in lieu of the benefits provided herein, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(Ord. 99-25, passed 7-6-99) 
34.50 - Disability. 
(A)  Disability benefits in-line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 42 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the town for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the monthly pension payable to a member who is determined to be totally and permanently disabled in accordance with this subsection (A) shall be 3.2 percent of average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service for a disability incurred on or after July 8, 2002, and 3.5 percent of average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service for a disability incurred on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section; but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 42 percent of the average final compensation of the member. 
(B)  In-line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in-line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subsection shall apply only to those conditions described in this subsection that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this subsection (B)(2), the following definitions apply: 
(i)  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
(ii)  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed full-time by the town as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
(iii)  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
(iv)  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
a.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a nonhealth care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
b.  At the site of an accident, fire or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
c.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
d.  Is responsible for the custody and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
(v)  "Occupational exposure", in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
(b)  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
(i)  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
a.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
b.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
c.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
d.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
(ii)  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
(iii)  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
(c)  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the town to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
(d)  Record of exposures. The town shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the town of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis. 
(e)  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
(i)  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This subsection does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
(ii)  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(C)  Disability benefits not in-line of duty. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the town for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the monthly pension payable to a member who is determined to be totally and permanently disabled in accordance with this subsection (C) shall be 3.2 percent of average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service for a disability incurred on or after July 8, 2002, and 3.5 percent of average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service for a disability incurred on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section. 
(D)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained by the member after his employment as a firefighter with the Town of Longboat Key shall have terminated. 
(E)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of sections 34.43 through 34.67, may be periodically re-examined by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, the board shall recommend to the town that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a firefighter, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
    If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the town as a firefighter, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the town will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
    The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(F)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability prior to his normal retirement date, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability or attains his normal retirement date while still disabled, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
    Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsections 34.52(A)(1) or (A)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit.

34.51 - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a firefighter, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(A)  If the member has less than five years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(B)  If the member has five or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit or, if elected, an optional form of benefit as provided for in subsection 34.52(A)(4), determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, and in accordance with the following vesting schedule: 
Years of Credited Service Percentage of
Vesting Less than 5 years 0 5 years but less than 6 years 50 6 years but less than 7 years 60 7 years but less than 8 years 70 8 years but less than 9 years 80 9 years but less than 10 years 90 10 years or more 100  
    The benefits shall be payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
(C)  Any vested member of the system whose position is terminated, for whatever reason, but who remains employed by the town in some other capacity, shall have all retirement benefits accrued up to the date of such termination under this system preserved, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions from this system. Such accrued retirement benefits shall be payable at his otherwise early (reduced as for early retirement) or normal retirement date hereunder, or later, in accordance with the provisions of this system. 
(Ord. 99-25, passed 7-6-99) 
34.52 - Optional forms of benefits. 
(A)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the present value of payments to the retiree shall not be less than 50 percent of the total present value of payments to the retiree and his joint pensioner. 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(4)  A lump sum amount, however, the board shall not approve a request for a lump sum distribution to any member, joint pensioner or beneficiary of a member who was hired after April 1, 1992, in an amount in excess of $5,000.00. 
(5)  Deferred retirement option plan. A member may enter into the deferred retirement option plan (DROP), which is to be created and administered by the board of trustees of the plan on the first day of any month following the completion of attaining normal retirement date (age). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a member who as of June 1, 2013, is within five years of the normal retirement date, may enter the DROP without penalty or enhancements on the first day of any month prior to September 30, 2013. Any member entering DROP pursuant to this provision must execute a voluntary resignation irrevocable for any reason to be effective at the end of the member's participation in the DROP, and which provides that the member shall not be eligible for reemployment with the town, except at the exclusive option of the town. 
    The maximum duration of participation in the DROP shall not exceed 36 months. 
    A member may participate in the DROP only once and after commencement in the DROP the member shall never have the right to be a contributing member of the plan again. 
    Upon the effective date of the commencement of participation in the DROP, membership in the plan shall terminate and neither the employee nor employer contributions shall be payable. The member contributions to the plan, including those picked up by the town shall cease and instead of being paid to the plan, shall be paid to the employee. For purposes on this section, average monthly earnings and creditable service shall remain as they existed on the effective date of commencement of participation in the DROP. The monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable, had the member elected to cease employment and receive a service retirement benefit, shall be credited to the member's DROP account. 
    The member's DROP account shall earn interest at a rate set quarterly by the board of trustees. Such interest rate shall not exceed the plan's net rate of investment return for the year and shall be credited to each individual account balance on a quarterly basis. In the alternative a DROP participant may select, at the participant's option a fixed rate money market account, as established by the board of trustees. Such option shall be available at any time during the 36-month DROP period as an irrevocable one-time option. 
    Individual DROP accounts shall not be subject to any fees or charges of any kind for any purpose. 
    If a member dies during the period of participation in the DROP, a lump sum payment equal to the member's account balance shall be paid to the member's named beneficiary or, if none, to the member's estate; in addition, any survivor benefits selected by the member shall be payable. 
    Upon termination of employment, a participant in the DROP shall receive, at the member's option, a lump sum payment from the account equal to the payments to the account, plus earned interest, or an annuity based upon the member's account balance, or the member may elect any other method of payment approved by the board of trustees. 
    If employment is not terminated at the end of the period specified for participation in the DROP, payments into the account shall cease and no further interest shall be earned or credited to the member's DROP account. The amount in the DROP account shall not be payable to the member until the member terminates employment. 
    If a member dies after the period of participation in the DROP but while still an employee, a lump sum payment equal to the member's account balance shall be paid to the member's named beneficiary or, if none, to the member's estate; in addition, any survivor benefits selected by the member shall be payable. 
(B)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (A)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner up to two times, without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint survivor or designated beneficiary. The member need not provide proof of the good health of the joint survivor or beneficiary being removed, and the joint survivor or beneficiary being removed need not be living. After any such change in joint survivor or beneficiary, the member's pension benefit will be recalculated accordingly by the actuary and retirement income shall be payable to the member based on the new calculation. 
(C)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(D)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially determined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 34.53. 
(E)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 34.49. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (A), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 34.53. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection 34.48(A), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(F)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(G)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the monthly benefit amount is less than $100.00 or the total commuted value of the remaining monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $5,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. 99-25, passed 7-6-99; Amd. Ord. 2000-18, passed 6-20-00; Amd. Ord. 02-06, passed 7-8-02; Amd. Ord. 04-16, passed 7-12-04; Ord. 2010-03, passed 3-1-10; Ord. 2013-13, passed 7-1-13; Ord. 2015-04, passed 2-2-15) 
34.53 - Beneficiaries. 
(A)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(B)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (A), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(C)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. 99-25, passed 7-6-99) 
34.54 - Claims procedures. 
(A)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(B)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. 99-25, passed 7-6-99) 
34.55 - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement containing the documents and information required by state law. 
(Ord. 99-25, passed 7-6-99; Ord. 2015-04, passed 2-2-15) 
34.56 - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of sections 34.43 through 34.67, in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the Secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. 99-25, passed 7-6-99) 
34.57 - Compliance with Internal Revenue Code. 
(A)  Maximum pension. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, the annual pension that is accrued by or paid to a participant shall not exceed the dollar limitation set forth below. If the benefit the participant would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
(1)  Definitions used in this section: 
(a)  "Annual pension" means the benefits received by a participant under this plan expressed in the form of a straight life annuity. In determining whether benefits payable exceed the dollar limitation set forth below, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
(i)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the participant under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit payable to the participant; or 
(ii)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the participant, computed using a five percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table described in section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) for that annuity starting date. 
    No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this subsection (a), and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this subsection (A) of section 34.57 applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to section 415(d) of the Code. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
(b)  "Dollar Limitation" means $160,000.00 (subject to the annual adjustments provided under section 415(d) of the IRC). Said amount shall be adjusted based on the age of the participant when benefits begin, as follows: 
(i)  Except with respect to a participant who is a "qualified participant" as defined in section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Code, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code) beginning before age 62 the Age-adjusted dollar limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
a.  The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as a deferred straight life annuity commencing at age 62, where annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age 62 are equal to the dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a five percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
b.  The dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d)) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan to the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan commencing at age 62, with both annual amounts determined without applying the rules of section 415. 
(ii)  For benefits beginning after the age of 65, the age-adjusted dollar limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
a.  The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as a straight life annuity commencing at age 65, where annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age 65 are equal to the dollar limitation of section 415(b)(1)(A) (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a five percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
b.  The section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) and section 1.415(d)-1 for the limitation year) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan to the adjusted age 65 straight life annuity. The adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity means the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity payable to the participant, computed disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are applied to offset accruals. For this purpose, the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity is determined without applying the rules of section 415. The adjusted age 65 straight life annuity means the annual amount of the straight life annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical participant who is 65 years old and has the same accrued benefit (with no actuarial increases for commencement after age 65) as the participant receiving the distribution (determined disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65 and without applying the rules of section 415). 
c.  There shall be no age adjustment of the dollar limitation with respect to benefits beginning between the ages of 62 and 65. 
(iii)  The limitations set forth in this subsection (A) of section 34.57 shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed $10,000.00 provided the participant has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the town. 
(iv)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under section subsection 415(d) of the Code. 
(v)  In the case of a participant who has fewer than ten years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in subsection (1)(b) of this section (A) shall be multiplied by a fraction: (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan; and (ii) the denominator of which is ten. 
(vi)  Any portion of a participant's benefit that is attributable to mandatory employee contributions (unless picked-up by the town) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under section 415 of the Code. 
(vii)  Should any participant participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the town, in any case in which the participant's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the participant's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the participant's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
(viii)  For a participant who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to section 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to sections 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(ix)  The determination of the annual pension under subsection (a)(1) of this subsection (A) of section 34.57 shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under section 415 of the Code) Social Security supplements described in section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(x)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of section 415 of the Code, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the town shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this subsection (A) of section 34.57 of the plan and the provisions of section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of section 415 of the Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this subsection (A) of section 34.57 shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
(B)  Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
-  April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of 701/2 years; or 
-  April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(C)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in subsection (B) of this section 34.57. 
(2)  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
(a)  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(i)  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 701/2, if later. 
(ii)  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
(iii)  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
(D)  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
(1)  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subsection (C)(2)(a) above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
(a)  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
(b)  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(2)  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
(3)  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which: 
(i)  The participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins; 
(ii)  The participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary; and 
(iii)  The surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subsections (1)(a) and 2(b) above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(E)  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
(1)  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
(2)  Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subsection, or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(F)  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with the subsections below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(1)  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
(a)  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
(b)  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described above, whichever is applicable, of this subsection (b); 
(c)  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
(d)  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
(i)  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the bureau of labor statistics; 
(ii)  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the Code; 
(iii)  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
(iv)  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsections (2)(A)(i) or (2)(A)(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(G)  For purposes of this subsection, distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse, before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with subsection (2)(A) above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(H)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the Plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
(2)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to subsection (2) of this subsection. 
(3)  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(I)  Eligible rollover distribution. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions . The following definitions apply to this section: 
(a)  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: 
(i)  Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; 
(ii)  Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; 
(iii)  The portion of any distribution that is a hardship distribution described in section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) of the Code; and 
(iv)  The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
(b)  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Code, an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, or, with respect to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of Code section 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. 
(c)  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined in section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Code who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code or an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code shall be considered a distributee. 
(d)  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(J)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in section 401(a)(31) of the Code, payable under the plan shall be $1,000.00. 
(K)  Compensation limitations under section 401(a)(17): 
(1)  In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is $200,000.00, as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. 
(2)  Any reference in the plan to the limitation under section 401 (a)(17) of the Code shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision.

(A)  The ordinance codified in sections 34.43 through 34.67, establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(B)  If sections 34.43 through 34.67 shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of sections 34.43 through 34.67, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in sections 34.43 through 34.67, who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal. The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all non-forfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the town, or then current plan sponsor, if additional assets are required in which event the town, or then current plan sponsor, shall continue to financially support the pension plan until all non-forfeitable benefits have been funded. At such time, the funds shall be appropriated and distributed in accordance with F.S. § 175.361. 
    The allocation of the fund provided for in this subsection may, as decided by the board, be carried out through the purchase of insurance company contracts to provide the benefits determined in accordance with this subsection. The fund may be distributed in one sum to the persons entitled to said benefits or the distribution may be carried out in such other equitable manner as the board may direct. The fund may be continued in existence for purposes of subsequent distributions. 
    If, at any time during the first ten years after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter originally establishing this system, the system shall be terminated or the full current costs of the system shall not have been met, anything in the system to the contrary notwithstanding, town contributions which may be used for the benefit of any one of the 25 highest paid members on the effective date, whose anticipated annual retirement allowance provided by the town's contributions at member's normal retirement date would exceed $1,500.00, shall not exceed the greater of either: a) $20,000.00; or b), an amount computed by multiplying the smaller of $10,000.00 or 20 percent of such member's average annual earnings during his last five years of service by the number of years of service since the effective date. In the event that it shall hereafter be determined by statute, court decision, ruling by the commissioner of Internal Revenue, or otherwise, that the provisions of this paragraph are not then necessary to qualify the system under the Code, this paragraph shall be ineffective without the necessity of further amendment of sections 39.43 through 34.67. 
(C)  After all the vested and accrued benefits provided hereunder have been paid and after all other liabilities have been satisfied, then and only then shall any remaining funds revert to the general fund of the town.

The board of trustees may, upon the written request of the retiree of the pension plan, authorize the plan administrator to withhold from the retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for premiums for accident, health, and long-term care insurance for the retiree and the retiree's spouse and dependents. The pension plan, and its board of trustees, shall not incur any liability for participation in this permissive program should its actions be taken in good faith.

(C)  Court shall be defined as any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction which is exercising its jurisdiction to consider a proceeding involving the alleged commission of a specified offense. Prior to forfeiture, the board shall hold a hearing on which notice shall be given to the member whose benefits are being considered for forfeiture.

(Ord. 99-25, passed 7-6-99) 
34.65 - Indemnification.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of the system: 
(A)  The accrued benefits of all members of this system who are employed and not participating in the DROP on September 30, 2013, shall be frozen on that date. All members shall be fully vested in their frozen accrued benefit based on their length of service. The value of each member's frozen accrued benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the system in effect on September 30, 2013, based on the member's credited service and average final compensation on that date. The frozen accrued benefit shall be payable to the member upon termination of town employment and attaining age 55 with 30 years of credited service or age 62 regardless of years of credited service, whichever occurs first. Alternatively, a member who is employed and not participating in the DROP on September 30, 2013, may elect to receive the frozen accrued benefit, reduced in accordance with subsection 34.78(D), upon termination of town employment and attaining age 50 with 15 years of credited service. In applying the preceding two sentences, credited service shall include all credited service as a member of this system prior to October 1, 2013, and all periods of employment with the Town of Longboat Key on and after October 1, 2013. For the purpose of determining a member's frozen accrued benefit in accordance with this subsection (A), salary shall include any payments of accrued leave that do not exceed the member's accrued leave balance as of July 1, 2011, and that would have been included in the member's salary if the member retired prior to October 1, 2013. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, upon separation from employment the amount of accrued leave included in a member's salary for the purpose of determining the member's frozen accrued benefit shall be the lesser of the amount of leave accrued at the time of separation from employment, or the amount of accrued leave that would have been included in the member's salary if the member retired prior to October 1, 2013, and the member's frozen accrued benefit shall be adjusted accordingly. 
(B)  No benefits shall be accrued under this system on or after October 1, 2013, and no member contributions to this system shall be required on or after that date. The town shall continue to make contributions to the system in accordance with subsection 34.77(B), and the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with sections 34.73 through 34.98, as modified by this section 34.72, until all accrued benefits have been paid to all eligible members and beneficiaries. 
(C)  Any member of this system who is employed on September 30, 2013 and has less than ten years of credited service on that date may elect to receive a refund of their accumulated contributions or the actuarial present value of their frozen accrued benefit, in lieu of any other benefit under the system. Such election must be made in writing on a form provided by the town on or before December 13, 2013, and if a member does not make a timely election he/she shall retain the frozen accrued benefit and shall not be eligible for a refund of accumulated contributions or the actuarial present value of their frozen accrued benefit, except as otherwise provided in the plan. 
(D)  Effective October 1, 2013, all current and future general employees of the Town of Longboat Key shall participate in a defined contribution retirement plan established by the Town of Longboat Key, and shall be eligible for benefits and make contributions to the defined contribution plan for all service as a general employee with the town on and after that date, in accordance with the defined contribution plan, as it may be amended from time to time. 
(E)  Members of this system who retired, entered the drop or terminated town employment with the right to a deferred vested benefit prior to October 1, 2013 shall be entitled to receive benefits from the system in accordance with the provisions of the system in effect on the date of their retirement, DROP entry, or termination of employment. Members who retire or enter the DROP prior to October 1, 2013 shall not be eligible for reemployment with the town after that date, except at the exclusive option of the town. 
(F)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 34.96(B)(1), a member who as of June 1, 2013 is within five years of the normal retirement date, may enter the DROP without penalty or enhancements on the first day of any month prior to September 30, 2013. Any member entering DROP pursuant to this provision must execute a voluntary resignation irrevocable for any reason to be effective at the end of the member's participation in the DROP, and which provides that the member shall not be eligible for reemployment with the town, except at the exclusive option of the town. 
(G)  Effective July 5, 2016, any member of this system with the right to receive a deferred vested benefit who has not begun to receive a benefit may, on or before October 1, 2016, make a one-time irrevocable election on a form provided by the town to receive a refund of their accumulated contributions or the actuarial present value of their frozen accrued benefit, in lieu of any other benefit under the system. For the purpose of determining the actuarial present value of the frozen accrued benefit, such benefit shall include the lesser of the amount of leave accrued as of July 5, 2016, or the amount of accrued leave that would have been included in the member's salary if the member retired prior to October 1, 2013.

(A)  As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    "Accumulated contributions" means a member's own contributions, without interest.

    "Actuarial equivalent" means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Table and an interest rate of 7.75 percent per annum. This definition may only be amended by the town pursuant to the recommendation of the board using assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to town discretion. 
    "At-will employee" means any actively employed person in the regular full-time service of the town who serves at the pleasure of the town manager and who may be removed from their position and/or disciplined up to and including termination by the town manager for any or no reason subject only to applicable law.

    "Beneficiary" means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    "Board" means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.

A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the town pending the possibility of being reemployed as a general employee, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the town, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a general employee with the town within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a general employee shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the general employee repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within 90 days after his reemployment. 
    The years or parts of a year that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L. 103-353), after separation from employment as a general employee to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
A.  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
B.  The member returns to his employment as a general employee within one year following the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
C.  The member deposits into the fund the same sum that the member would have contributed, if any, if he had remained a general employee during his absence. The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this subchapter shall be five years. The member must deposit all missed contributions within a period equal to three times the period of military service, but not more than five years, following reemployment or he will forfeit the right to receive credited service for his military service pursuant to this paragraph. 
D.  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Code § 414(u)(12), an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Code § 3401(h)(2) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Code § 415(c). This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    "Fund" means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    "General employee" means any actively employed person in the regular full-time service of the town, including those in their initial probationary employment period and those at-will employees who do not elect to not be a member of the system as provided for in section 34-74, but not including certified police officers and certified firefighters employed by the town. 
    "Member" means an actively employed general employee who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by town ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    "Plan year" means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    "Retiree" means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    "Retirement" means a member's separation from town employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system or entry into the deferred retirement option plan. 
    "Salary" means the total compensation for services rendered to the town as a general employee reportable on the member's W-2 form, plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in § 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code § 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    "Spouse" means the lawful wife or husband of a member or retiree at the time benefits become payable.

(4)  A lump sum amount, however, the board shall not approve a request for a lump sum distribution to any member, joint pensioner or beneficiary of a member who was hired after April 1, 1992 in an amount in excess of $5,000.00. 
(B)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (A)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner if the designated joint pensioner and the member were married at the time of member's retirement and are divorced subsequent thereto and the joint pensioner is alive at the time of the change. 
(C)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(D)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially determined to take into account the age and sex of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated Beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 34.82. 
(E)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 34.79. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (A), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 34.82. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection 34.78(A), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2, or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the town. 
(F)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(G)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. 2010-04, passed 3-1-10) 
34.82 - Beneficiaries. 
(A)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(B)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (A), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(C)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. 2010-04, passed 3-1-10) 
34.83 - Claims procedures. 
(A)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(B)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. 2010-04, passed 3-1-10) 
34.84 - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of the ordinance from which this subchapter derives, in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. 2010-04, passed 3-1-10) 
34.85 - Maximum pension. 
(A)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code § 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code § 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code § 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code § 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code § 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code § 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code § 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(B)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (A), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code § 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulations § 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Code § 417(e)(3) does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption); and: (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulations § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62); and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Code § 417(e)(3)(B) (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Code § 417(e)(3)(B)); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Code § 417(e)(3) applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5 percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption); and: (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulations § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Code § 417(e)(3)(B) (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Code § 417(e)(3)(B)); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulations § 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate {prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period}); and: (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulations § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Code § 417(e)(3)(B) (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing § 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(C)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under Code § 415 (b)(2) and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code § 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(D)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code § 415(b) (the "Limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code § 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code § 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code § 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code § 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Code § 415(b) and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(E)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code § 415(b), so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the town, the adjustments provided for in subsection (E)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (E)(1) above shall not be applicable to pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 34.79. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (A) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(F)  Less than ten years of participation or service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the town shall be the amount determined under subsection (A) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 34.79. 
(G)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code § 414(j) maintained by the town shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all town defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(H)  Ten thousand dollar limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 34.85, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (H) of section 34.85 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the town contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the town has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the town, the limit under this subsection (H) of section 34.85 shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(I)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(J)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 34.96 and 34.97, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Code § 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code § 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of Code § 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code § 415(c). 
    For purposes of applying subsection (J)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code § 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection, and for purposes of applying subsection (J)(1)b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Code § 415(c)(1)(B) solely by reason of this subsection. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
    Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding the clause of subsection (J)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(K)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the Code § 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (K), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations § 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations § 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code § 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code §§ 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052, and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code § 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code § 3401(a)(2)). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code §§ 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code § 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations § 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code § 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code §§ 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (K)(2)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code § 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Code § 415(c), the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (K) shall not exceed the annual limit under Code § 401(a)(17). 
(L)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to Social Security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code.

34.86 - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(A)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code § 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code § 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA § 242(b) (2), Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (A)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with § 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to § 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(B)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the town. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (B)(2), other than subsection (B)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
    For purposes of this subsection (B)(2) and subsection (E), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (B)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (B)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (B)(2)a.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of § 401(a) (9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in § 414(k) of the Code, will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of § 401(a) (9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(C)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to sections 34.78, 34.79, 34.80 or 34.81 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 34.79) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(D)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Code § 401(a) (9) (G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation § 1.401(a) (9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Code § 401(a) (9) (G) and Treasury Regulation § 1.401-1(b) (1) (I), or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(E)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under § 40l(a) (9) of the Code and § 1.401(a) (9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury Regulations.

(A)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. Federal Tax Laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(D)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future town contributions.

(G)  Vesting. 
(1)  A member will be 100 percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and

34.88 - Repeal or termination of system. 
(A)  The ordinance codified in this subchapter, establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(B)  If this subchapter shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this subchapter who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(C)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the town if additional assets are required, in which event the town shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each general employee entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the general employee's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the general employee. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the town. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3).

(Ord. 2010-04, passed 3-1-10) 
34.93 - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(A)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  "Eligible rollover distribution." An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under § 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in § 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in § 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in § 401(a) or § 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code § 401(a); or to an annuity contract described in Code § 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
b.  "Eligible retirement plan." An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in § 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in § 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in § 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in § 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in § 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002 an annuity contract described in § 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in §401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in § 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  "Distributee." A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code § 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  "Direct rollover." A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(B)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in § 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in § 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under § 457(b) of the Code, which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in §§ 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(C)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
(Ord. 2010-04, passed 3-1-10) 
34.94 - Family and Medical Leave Act. 
    The fractional parts of the 12-month period ending each March 1, that a member is on leave without pay from the town pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), shall be added to his credited service provided that: 
(A)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the fractional parts of the 12 months ending each March 1 for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund, plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of periods of credited service. 
(B)  The request for credited service for FMLA leave time for the 12-month period prior to each March 1, and payment of professional fees shall be made on or before March 31. 
(C)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made on or before April 30 for the preceding 12-month period ending March 1, and shall be made in one lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be issued. 
(D)  Credited service purchased pursuant to this section shall not count toward vesting. 
(Ord. 2010-04, passed 3-1-10) 
34.95 - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(A)  Definitions. As used in this section 34-95, the following definitions apply: 
(1)  "DROP." The Town of Longboat Key General Employees' Retirement System Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
(2)  "DROP account." The account established for each DROP participant under subsection (C). 
(B)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a general employee, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least 15 business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (B)(2), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 60 months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the town not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (B)(3); or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a general employee. 
b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection (4) above, all amounts provided for in subsection (C)(2), including monthly benefits and investment earnings and losses or interest, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (D) when he terminates his employment as a general employee. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (B)(4), shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. For purposes of determining the accrued benefit, the member's salary for the purposes of calculating his average final compensation shall include an amount equal to any lump sum payments which would have been paid to the member and included as salary as defined herein, had the member retired under normal retirement and not elected DROP participation. Member contributions attributable to any lump sums used in the benefit calculation and not actually received by the member shall be deducted from the first payments to the member's DROP account. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system, nor shall he be eligible for pre-retirement death benefits. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a general employee, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a general employee. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a general employee. 
(C)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (C)(2), and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a general employee and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (B)(4)b. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (B)(3) and (B)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a general employee. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (B)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (C)(2), shall be debited or credited after each fiscal year quarter with either: 
1.  Interest at an effective rate of 6.5 percent per annum compounded monthly on the prior month's ending balance; or 
2.  Earnings, determined as follows: 
    The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
    Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive either interest or earnings on his account to be determined as provided above. The member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation, plus interest or earnings earned as of that date, plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter and prior to distribution. If a member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's 1st month of employment following the last month of permissible DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such nontransferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the town. A member employed by the town after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for pre-retirement death, nor will he accrue additional credited service. 
(D)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (D), upon his termination of employment as a general employee. Except as provided in subsection (D)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a general employee. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a cash lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (D)(6). Elections under this subsection shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  Notwithstanding the preceding, if a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (D), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of subsection (D), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 34.93. 
(E)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including, but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP'S assets. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board, nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(F)  General provisions. 
(1)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the town at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(2)  Facility of payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due him, unless claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a child, a parent or other blood relative, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(3)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(4)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the town. If such person has not made written claim therefore within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP.

(5)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address.

If any check mailed by registered or certified United States Mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(6)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the town, nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(7)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 34.95, are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(8)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(9)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

34.98 - Reemployment after retirement.

Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the town in any capacity, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of retirement benefits during any such employment period. A retiree who returns to work under the provisions of this section shall not be eligible for membership in this system, and, therefore, shall not accumulate additional credited service for subsequent periods of employment described in this section, shall not be required to make contributions to the system, nor shall he be eligible for any other benefit other than the retiree's normal retirement benefit. 
(C)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the town after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment is ineligible to participate in this system, shall, during the period of such reemployment, continue to receive retirement benefits previously earned.

"Normal retirement", as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. A retiree who returns to work under the provisions of this section shall not be eligible for membership in the system, and, therefore, shall not accumulate additional credited service for subsequent periods of employment described in this section, shall not be required to make contributions to the system, nor shall he be eligible for any other benefit other than the retiree's early retirement benefit when he again becomes eligible as provided herein. Retirement pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall be deemed early retirement for purposes of this section if the member was permitted to retire prior to the customary retirement date provided for in the system at the time of retirement. 
(E)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits.

In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the retirement system in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. ch. 280.

(2)  In exercising its discretionary authority with respect to the management of the moneys and assets of the retirement system, the board shall exercise the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing, that a person of prudence, acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters, would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims. 
(3)  The board shall have full power and authority to invest and reinvest the moneys and assets held for the benefit of the members, retirees and beneficiaries of the system, subject to all terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions imposed by law on the investments of public employee retirement system assets, and subject to investment policy adopted by the board.

(7)  Neither the board, nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(8)  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
(9)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds or securities of any corporation, association or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(10)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(11)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
(12)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(13)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents; provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board.

Article II. - Assessments 

37.23 - Authority and purpose. 
    The town commission is hereby authorized to impose assessments against property located within an assessment area to fund capital improvements or essential services. The assessment shall be computed in a manner that fairly and reasonably apportions the capital costs or service costs among the parcels of property within an assessment area, based upon objectively determinable assessment units related to the value, use, or physical characteristics of the property. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.24 - Creation of assessment areas.

Either the initial assessment resolution proposing an assessment area or the final assessment resolution creating an assessment area shall include brief descriptions of the capital improvements or essential services proposed for such area, a description of the property to be included within the assessment area, and specific legislative findings that recognize the special benefit to be provided by each proposed capital improvement or essential service to property within the assessment area. Properties in any assessment area need not be adjacent or contiguous to any other property in an assessment area. 
(B)  At its option, the town commission may establish a process pursuant to which the owners of property may petition for creation of an assessment area to fund capital improvements and essential services. Notwithstanding any petition process established pursuant to this section, the town commission shall retain the authority to create assessment areas without a landowner petition. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.25 - Initial assessment resolution.

(C)  Estimate the service cost or capital cost; 
(D)  Establish a maximum assessment rate if desired by the town commission;

(F)  Include specific legislative findings that recognize the equity provided by the apportionment methodology; 
(G)  Schedule a public hearing at a meeting of the town commission, which meeting shall be a regular, adjourned, or special meeting, at which to hear objections of all interested persons and to consider adoption of the final assessment resolution and approval of the assessment roll; and

37.30 - Annual assessment resolution. 
    The town commission shall adopt an annual assessment resolution during its budget adoption process for each fiscal year in which assessments will be imposed to approve the assessment roll for such fiscal year. The final assessment resolution shall constitute the annual assessment resolution for the initial fiscal year. The assessment roll, as prepared in accordance with the initial assessment resolution and confirmed or amended by the final assessment resolution, shall be confirmed or amended by the annual assessment resolution to reflect the then applicable portion of the cost of the capital improvements or essential services, or both, to be paid by assessments. If the proposed assessment for any parcel of property exceeds the maximum assessment rate established in the initial assessment resolution for the area and described in the notices provided pursuant to sections 37.27 and 37.28 hereof or if an assessment is imposed against property not previously subject thereto, the town commission shall provide notice to the owner of such property in accordance with section 37.28 hereof and conduct a public hearing prior to adoption of the annual assessment resolution. Failure to adopt an annual assessment resolution during the budget adoption process may be cured at any time. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.31 - Effect of assessment resolutions. 
    The adoption of the final assessment resolution or of an annual assessment resolution requiring notice as provided in section 37.30 hereof, shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the apportionment methodology, the rate of assessment, the maximum annual assessment of each parcel, the adoption of the assessment roll and the levy and lien of the assessments), unless proper steps are initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the town commission's adoption of the final assessment resolution. The assessments for each fiscal year shall be established upon adoption of the annual assessment resolution. If the assessments are to be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the assessment roll, as approved by the annual assessment resolution, shall be certified to the tax collector. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.32 - Prepayment of assessments. 
(A)  The assessment imposed against any parcel of property to fund capital improvements shall be subject to prepayment at the option of the property owner, as follows: 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of obligations, the assessment coordinator shall provide first class mailed notice to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment of the town commission's intent to issue such obligations. On or prior to the date specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the 30th day following the date on which the notice is delivered to the possession of the U.S. Postal Service), or such later date as the town commission may allow in its sole discretion, the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment shall be entitled to prepay the total assessment obligation. 
(2)  Following the date specified in the notice provided pursuant to subsection (A)(1) hereof, or such later date as the town commission may allow in its sole discretion, the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment shall be entitled to prepay the total remaining assessment upon payment of an amount equal to the sum of: (a) such parcel's share of the principal amount of obligations then outstanding; (b) the premium associated with redemption of such parcel's share of the principal amount of obligations then outstanding; and (c) interest on such parcel's share of the principal amount of obligations then outstanding, from the most recent date to which interest has been paid to the next date following such prepayment on which the town can redeem obligations after providing all notices required by the ordinance or resolution authorizing issuance of such obligations; provided however, that during any period commencing on the date the annual assessment roll is certified for collection pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and ending on the next date on which unpaid ad valorem taxes become delinquent, the town may reduce the amount required to prepay the assessments imposed against any parcel of property by the amount of the assessment certified for collection with respect to such parcel. 
(B)  At the town's election, the assessment imposed against any parcel of property may be subject to acceleration and mandatory prepayment if at any time a tax certificate has been issued and remains outstanding in respect of such property. In such event, the amount required for mandatory prepayment shall be the same as that required for an optional prepayment authorized by subsection (A)(2) hereof. 
(C)  The amount of all prepayments computed in accordance with this section 37.32 shall be final. The town shall not be required to refund any portion of a prepayment if: (1) the capital cost is less than the amount upon which such prepayment was computed; or (2) annual assessments will not be imposed for the full number of years anticipated at the time of such prepayment. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.33 - Lien of assessments. 
(A)  Upon adoption of the annual assessment resolution for each fiscal year, assessments to be collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid. The lien shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the town commission of the annual assessment resolution and shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes. 
(B)  Upon adoption of the final assessment resolution, assessments to be collected under the alternative method of collection provided in section 37.38 hereof shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid. The lien shall be deemed perfected on the date notice thereof is recorded in the Official Records of Sarasota County, Florida and/or Manatee County, Florida, as the context of the relevant assessment area may require. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.34 - Revisions to assessments. 
    If any assessment made under the provisions of this ordinance is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the town commission is satisfied that any such assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the town commission has omitted the inclusion of any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so included, the town commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new assessment against any property benefited by the capital improvement or essential service, following as nearly as may be practicable the provisions of this ordinance, and in case such second assessment is annulled, the town commission may levy and impose other assessments until a valid assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.35 - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any assessment under the provisions of this ordinance shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all proceedings related to such assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this ordinance; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section 37.35, any party objecting to an assessment imposed pursuant to this ordinance must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.36 - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(A)  No act of error or omission on the part of the town commission, assessment coordinator, property appraiser, tax collector, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of any assessment imposed by the town commission under the provisions of this ordinance. 
(B)  The number of assessment units attributed to a parcel of property may be corrected at any time by the assessment coordinator, including upon presentation of competent substantial evidence by the owner of such parcel. Any such correction which reduces an assessment shall be considered valid from the date on which the assessment was imposed and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the assessment imposed under the provisions of this ordinance. Any such correction which increases an assessment or imposes an assessment on omitted property shall first require notice to the affected owner at the address shown on the tax roll notifying the owner of the date, time and place that the town commission will consider confirming the correction and offering the owner an opportunity to be heard. 
(C)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to errors and insolvencies for ad valorem taxes. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
Article III. - Collection of Assessments 

37.37 - Method of collection. 
    Unless directed otherwise by the town commission, assessments (other than assessments imposed against government property) shall be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the town shall comply with all applicable provisions thereof, including but not limited to: (1) entering into a written agreement with the property appraiser and the tax collector for reimbursement of necessary expenses; (2) certifying the assessment roll to the tax collector; and (3) adopting a resolution of intent after publishing weekly notice of such intent for four consecutive weeks preceding the hearing. The resolution of intent may be adopted either prior to or following the initial assessment resolution; provided however, that the resolution of intent must be adopted prior to January 1 (March 1 with consent of the property appraiser and tax collector) of the year in which the assessments are first collected on the ad valorem tax bill. This section shall not be construed to require adoption of an additional resolution of intent, and notice thereof, if a resolution of intent was previously adopted and is currently in effect for the area in question. Any hearing or notice required by this ordinance may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15)

The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: (1) a brief explanation of the assessment; (2) a description of the assessment units used to determine the amount of the assessment; (3) the number of assessment units attributable to the parcel; (4) the total amount of the parcel's assessment for the appropriate period; (5) the location at which payment will be accepted; (6) the date on which the assessment is due; and (7) a statement that the assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(B)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the assessments shall be recorded in the Official Records of Sarasota County, Florida and/or Manatee County, Florida, as the context of the relevant assessment area may require. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(C)  The town shall have the right to appoint or retain an agent to foreclose and collect all delinquent assessments in the manner provided by law. An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the due date. The town or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of an assessment within 60 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the town or its agent will initiate a foreclosure action and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real estate, or otherwise as provided by law. 
(D)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the town may be the purchaser to the same extent as an individual person or corporation. The town may join in one foreclosure action the collection of assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent property owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the town and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the town as a result of such delinquent assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(E)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that: (1) notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by law and this ordinance; and (2) any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll to the tax collector. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.39 - Responsibility for enforcement. 
    The town and its agents, if any, shall maintain the duty to enforce the prompt collection of assessments by the means provided herein. The duties related to collection of assessments may be enforced at the suit of any holder of obligations in a court of competent jurisdiction by mandamus or other appropriate proceedings or actions. 
(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.40 - Government property. 
(A)  If assessments are imposed against government property, the town shall provide assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: (1) a brief explanation of the assessment; (2) a description of the assessment units used to determine the amount of the assessment; (3) the number of assessment units attributable to the parcel; (4) the total amount of the parcel's assessment for the appropriate period; (5) the location at which payment will be accepted; and (6) the date on which the assessment is due. 
(B)  Assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as assessments against other property within the assessment area and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment. 
(C)  An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the due date. The town shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its assessment within 60 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the town will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(D)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the town or its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the town as a result of such delinquent assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of, or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(E)  As an alternative to the foregoing, an assessment imposed against government property may be collected on the bill for any utility service provided to such government property. The town commission may also contract for such billing services with any utility not owned by the town. 
(F)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, assessments shall not be imposed against government property which is exempt or immune from the payment of special assessments and/or non-ad valorem assessments under state or federal law. The foregoing class of properties not to be assessed do not include government property that is leased for private use. Nothing herein shall be construed to require the imposition of assessments against government property.

Said obligations shall mature not later than 40 years after their issuance. The town commission shall determine by ordinance or resolution the form of the obligations, the manner of executing such obligations, and shall fix the denominations of such obligations, the place or places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or outside of the State of Florida, and such other terms and provisions of the obligations as it deems appropriate. The obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the town commission shall determine by ordinance or resolution.

(Ord. 2015-30, passed 12-7-15) 
37.46 - Taxing power not pledged. 
    Obligations issued under the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute a general obligation or pledge of the full faith and credit of the town within the meaning of the Constitution of the State of Florida, but such obligations shall be payable only from pledged revenue and, if applicable, proceeds of the assessments, in the manner provided herein and by the ordinance or resolution authorizing the obligations. The issuance of obligations under the provisions of this ordinance shall not directly or indirectly obligate the town to levy or to pledge any form of ad valorem taxation whatsoever. No holder of any such obligations shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the ad valorem taxing power on the part of the town to pay any such obligations or the interest thereon or to enforce payment of such obligations or the interest thereon against any property of the town, nor shall such obligations constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the town, except the pledged revenue.

The pledged revenue upon receipt thereof by the town shall be subject to the lien and pledge of the holders of any obligations or any entity other than the town providing credit enhancement on the obligations.

If the issuance of such refunding obligations results in an annual assessment that exceeds the estimated maximum annual assessments set forth in the notice provided pursuant to section 37.28 hereof, the town commission shall provide notice to the affected property owners and conduct a public hearing in the manner required by article III of this ordinance.

(A)  In determining the responsible and responsive bidder who submits the lowest and best bid, in addition to price, the town manager or his/her designee, shall consider, at a minimum: 
(1)  The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
(2)  Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
(3)  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the bidder; 
(4)  The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;

General contractors wishing to bid on the town's construction projects in excess of $100,000.00 may be required to be prequalified with the town manager or his/her designee prior to bid opening. Types of construction that may require prequalification include, but are not limited to, road and street, building, water and sewer, marine, bridge, and well drilling. The primary criteria considered in determining qualification are financial capability and previous job experience and performance. 
(1)  Prequalification is recommended to the town manager or his/her designee for final approval by a prequalification committee. 
(2)  Prequalification is not a conclusive determination of responsibility, and a prequalified bidder may be rejected as non-responsible on the basis of subsequently discovered information. 
(Ord. 2014-24, passed 7-7-14) 
38.20 - Bid and contract security.

Bid security shall be in a form satisfactory to the town attorney. Nothing herein shall prevent the requirement of such security on other contracts when the circumstances warrant. 
(2)  Amount of bid security. Bid security for all other competitive sealed bids and proposals shall be in an amount equal to at least five percent of the amount of the bid, unless the purchasing manager determines that the nature of the project is such that the bid security requirement would work a hardship on most potential bidders or otherwise deemed to be impractical or unnecessary. 
(3)  Rejection of bids for noncompliance with bid security requirements. When the invitation for bids requires bid security, a bid shall be rejected in the event of noncompliance unless it is determined that the bid fails to comply only in a nonsubstantial manner with the security requirements. 
(B)  Contract security. When a construction contract is awarded in excess of $100,000.00, security, as described below, shall be provided in conformance with the minimum requirements of F.S. § 255.05, and shall become binding upon the execution of the contract. 
(1)  A performance bond satisfactory to the town attorney, executed by a surety insurer authorized to do business in the State of Florida as a surety, in an amount equal to at least 100 percent of the price specified in the contract, conditioned that the contractor perform the contract in the time and manner prescribed in the contract; and 
(2)  A payment bond satisfactory to the town attorney, executed by a surety insurer authorized to do business in the State of Florida as a surety, in an amount equal to 100 percent of the price specified in the contract, conditioned that the contractor promptly make payments to all persons supplying labor, materials, or supplies used directly or indirectly in the performance of the work provided for in the contract, and who are claimants as described in F.S. § 255.05(1). 
(C)  Authority to require additional security. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the town to require a performance bond or other security in addition to those bonds, or in circumstances or amounts other than as specified in subsection (B) of this section.

Competitive sealed bidding shall be the preferred method of competition where possible. 
(B)  Any purchase for an amount less than $35,000.00, except as provided in section 38.15, or contract for the working of any capital improvement and repair projects in an amount less than $100,000.00 may be made in accordance with those procedures promulgated in subsection 38.18(A) provided, however, no purchase shall be artificially divided so as to constitute a purchase under this section. 
(C)  Nothing in the foregoing shall prohibit the town from renewing purchase orders or contracts provided the vendor was originally selected through a competitive selection process, and further provided such renewal is within the scope of the original purchase order or contract. 
(Ord. 03-03, passed 3-3-03: Ord. 07-08, passed 4-9-07; Ord. 2011-27, passed 8-10-11; Ord. 2014-24, passed 7-7-14)

(B)  Public notice. Public notice of the invitation for bids shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Sarasota or Manatee County once for a period not less than 14 days prior to bid receiving date or for a period as required by F.S. ch. 287 for public works projects. A bid invitation shall be made available to all vendors through an electronic notification service. The public notice shall identify the item being bid and state the place, date, and time of bid opening. 
(C)  Bidders list. Bids shall be invited from all responsible prospective vendors through an electronic notification service or such other notice as will acquaint them with the proposed purchase.

(D)  Bid submission. Bids must be received no later than the time and date and at the location specified for the bid opening in the invitation for bids. No bids shall be accepted after such time and date or at any location other than what is specified in the invitation for bids; any bids received later or at any other location than specified shall be returned to the bidder. It shall be the bidder's sole responsibility to ensure that its bid reaches the specified place for receipt of bids by the specified time. Bidders shall be allowed to withdraw their bids at any time prior to bid opening. 
(E)  Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place specified in the invitation for bids.

Bids will be made public in accordance with the provisions of F.S. ch. 119. 
(F)  Bid cancellation or postponement. The purchasing manager may, prior to bid opening, elect to cancel an invitation for bids or postpone the date and/or time of bid submission or opening. 
(G)  Corrections, additions to, and withdrawal. The purchasing manager shall promulgate and adopt policies regarding corrections, additions to, and withdrawal of bids.

(I)  Bid award. The town manager shall make award to the responsive and responsible bidder whose bid is determined to be the lowest and best bid that meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids and whose award will, in the opinion of the town manager, be in the best interest and most advantageous to the town. Awards shall be effective upon issuance of a purchase order, or written notice of award by the town manager. In the event only one responsive bid is received, the town manager may award to the sole bidder or rebid. Awards shall subsequently be posted at the town hall public bulletin board.

(K)  Multi-step sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers, or information relating to the experience and capabilities of the prospective bidders, to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers or experience and capabilities have been determined to be acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. 
(L)  Tie bids. If two or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, or in the case of proposals, the qualifications, quality, and service are equal, the contract shall be awarded to the local bidder/proposer. A local firm is defined as a firm with headquarters in geographical Manatee or Sarasota County. Headquarters shall mean the office location that serves as the administrative center and principal place of business. If two or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price or in the case of proposals, the qualifications, quality, and service are equal and no firms are deemed local, then the contract shall be awarded by drawing lots in public.

38.23 - Competitive sealed proposal process. 
    When it is determined and documented in writing by the using department and the purchasing manager that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practical or not advantageous to the town due to the technical or specialized nature of the goods or services sought, the purchasing manager may authorize the following competitive sealed proposal processes as an alternative to the competitive sealed bidding process: 
(A)  Request for proposals, request for qualifications, or request for information. Such requests, setting forth the terms and conditions of the goods or services sought including evaluation factors, shall be solicited through a request for proposals (RFP), request for qualifications (RFQ), or request for information (RFI) and public notice of the RFP/RFQ/RFI shall be given. The RFP/RFQ/RFI shall state the evaluation factors, which may include, but not be limited to: price, vendor approach and methodology, capability and experience. 
(B)  Proposal submission. Proposals must be received no later than the time and date and at the location specified for the proposal opening in the RFP/RFQ/RFI. No proposals shall be accepted after such time and date or at any location other than what is specified in the RFP/RFQ/RFI; any proposals received later or at any other location than specified shall be returned to the proposer. It shall be the proposer's sole responsibility to ensure that its proposal reaches the specified place for receipt of proposals by the specified time. Proposers shall be allowed to withdraw their proposals at any time prior to proposal opening. 
(C)  Proposal opening. Proposals shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place specified in the RFP/RFQ/RFI. The name of each proposer shall be announced and recorded at the public opening as indicated in the RFP/RFQ/RFI, or accepted and announced at a later time as allowed by F.S. ch. 119. Proposals will be made public in accordance with the provisions of F.S. ch. 119.

(E)  Corrections, additions to, and withdrawal. The purchasing manager shall promulgate and adopt policies regarding corrections, additions to, and withdrawal of proposals. 
(F)  Proposal receipt and proposal evaluation. Proposals shall be received without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this chapter. Proposals shall be evaluated based on the criteria set forth in the RFP/RFQ/RFI. No criteria may be used in proposal evaluations that are not set forth in the RFP/RFQ/RFI. 
(G)  Discussion with responsible and responsive proposers. Discussions may be conducted with responsible and responsive proposers who submit proposals for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of the solicitation requirements. Proposers shall be accorded fair and equal treatment and notice with respect to any opportunity for discussion and correction of proposals and such corrections may be permitted prior to award. In conducting discussions, there shall be no exchange of information regarding the content or feasibility of the proposals by competing proposers. 
(H)  Proposal evaluation and award. Award by the town manager shall be made to the most responsive, responsible proposer whose proposal is determined to be in the best interest and the most advantageous to the town in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in the RFP or to the most qualified firm in the case of a RFQ or RFI. Evaluation of proposers and/or proposals may be made in a multi-step selection or bidding process as set forth in the RFP/RFQ/RFI and shall be based upon factors of responsiveness and quality based upon criteria set forth in the RFP/RFQ/RFI. The RFP/RFQ/RFI shall state the relative importance of price and other criteria. Awards shall be effective upon written notice of award by the town manager. In the event only one responsive proposal is received, the town manager may award to the sole proposer or reissue the RFP/RFQ/RFI. Awards shall subsequently be posted at the town hall public bulletin board. Proposals with contracts will be approved for execution by the town manager, or any official authorized by the town manager, when the proposal awards period has been completed. 
(I)  Rejection of proposals. The town manager reserves the right to accept or reject any and all proposals or parts of proposals at any time when the public interest will be served thereby. The town manager shall notify the town commission of any proposal rejections pursuant to this subsection.

38.24 - Sole source purchases. 
    A sole source purchase exists when research has determined there is only one potential provider for an item.

(E)  Decision. After the purchasing manager has determined there is cause to suspend or debar a vendor, the purchasing manager shall notify the vendor in writing of the debarment or the period of suspension and the reasons for the action taken.

Any protest shall be concise and logically presented to facilitate review. Failure to substantially comply with any of the requirements in this section may be grounds for dismissal of the protest. Protests must be type-written and hand-delivered or mailed to the purchasing manager. If a protest is mailed, it shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and must be received by the purchasing manager prior to the applicable deadline. Protests may not be sent by e-mail or facsimile machine without the prior approval of the purchasing manager. Grounds for protest not timely raised shall be deemed waived and shall not be raised in a subsequent protest. 
(B)  Consideration of protest. 
(1)  The purchasing manager will acknowledge receipt of a protest by any party that has standing to do so ("protestor"), and the written comments of other potentially interested parties ("interested parties"), where applicable. The purchasing manager shall distribute copies of the protest to any interested parties within two business days of receiving the protest. Such interested parties must file any comments or response in writing with the purchasing manager within three business days of receiving the protest. The purchasing manager will promptly forward copies of any such comments and responses to the protester. 
(2)  Upon receipt of a valid protest, the town manager shall appoint a three-member protest dispute committee. The protest dispute committee shall attempt to hold a meeting with the protestor within ten town workdays of receipt of the protest. The purpose of the meeting of the protest dispute committee, the protestor, and interested parties, is to provide an opportunity: (1) to review the basis of the protest; (2) to evaluate the facts and merits of the protest; (3) if possible, to reach a resolution of the protest that is acceptable to the parties; and (4) if possible, to satisfy the protestor to the extent that the protest might be withdrawn. Further, the protest dispute committee may request additional submissions or information from the protestor or interested parties, or take any other actions deemed useful or necessary in making a decision. Any statements made by members of the protest dispute committee in any such meeting shall be considered statements made in furtherance of settlement and shall be inadmissible in subsequent legal proceeding. 
(3)  In the event the protest cannot be resolved by mutual agreement, the protest dispute committee shall then refer the protest to the town manager with a recommendation in writing for resolution of the protest. The town manager may conduct an evidentiary hearing if there are disputed issues of material fact. The town manager will conduct a review and will attempt to make a final written decision within ten town workdays after receipt of the recommendation or the date of the evidentiary hearing, whichever is later. The town manager's decision shall be final and binding unless a party commences an action in court. The town manager shall notify the town commission of any decisions by the town regarding a protest pursuant to this section. 
(4)  If the protest is sustained, the purchasing manager shall take the appropriate action to correct the procurement action and protect the rights of the protestor. If the protest is denied, the purchasing manager will notify the protestor and the interested parties, if any, to the extent they were previously informed. 
(C)  Requirements to protest. 
(1)  Deadline to file protest. 
a.  If the protest relates to a suspension or debarment, a formal written protest must be filed no later than 5:00 p.m. on the fifth full business day after vendor is notified of the suspension or debarment. 
b.  If the protest relates to the content of a solicitation for bids or proposals, a formal written protest must be filed no later than 5:00 p.m. on the fifth full business day after issuance of the bid/proposal package. 
c.  If the protest relates to the evaluation of bids or proposals, a formal written protest must be filed no later than 5:00 p.m. on the fifth full business day after the bidders/proposers receive notification of the determination regarding an evaluation of the bids or proposals. 
d.  If the protest relates to an award under a procurement process, a formal written protest must be filed no later than 5:00 p.m., on the fifth full business day after posting of the award determination. 
(2)  A formal written protest is considered filed with the town when the purchasing manager receives it. Accordingly, a protest is not timely filed unless it is received within the time specified above. Failure to file a formal written protest within the time period specified shall constitute a waiver of the right to protest and result in relinquishment of all rights to protest by the bidder/proposer. 
(3)  The formal written protest shall identify the protesting party and the solicitation involved; include a clear statement of the grounds on which the protest is based; refer to the statutes, laws, ordinances or other legal authorities which the protesting party deems applicable to such grounds; and specifically request the relief to which the protesting party deems itself entitled by application of such authorities to such grounds. 
(4)  Any party who files a written protest shall deposit with the finance department cash in the amount of $2,500.00 or an amount equal to five percent of the lowest acceptable bid, whichever is less, with its protest. If after completion of review by the protest dispute committee, town manager, and any subsequent court proceedings, the decision of the finance department is upheld, the town shall retain the full amount of the deposit to defray the costs and expenses incurred considering the protest. If the protestor prevails, the protestor shall recover the cash deposit. 
(D)  Sole remedy. These procedures shall be the sole remedy for challenging an award under a procurement. Bidder/proposers are prohibited from attempts to influence, persuade, or promote a protest through any other channels or means. Such attempts shall be cause for suspension in accordance with subsection 38.31(C) of this chapter. 
(E)  Damages. In the event of any court upholding the protestant's claim, the court awarded damages on behalf of the protestant shall be solely limited to bid or proposal preparation costs and reimbursement of the amount of the protest deposit. 
(F)  Time limits. The time limits in which protests must be filed as specified herein may be altered by specific provisions in the invitations for bids or request for proposals. 
(G)  Stay of procurement during protests. There shall be no automatic stay of procurement during protests.

Chapter 56 - CLEARING PRIVATE STREETS, ROADS, ROADWAYS AND PRIVATE PROPERTY 
  

56.01 - Intent and purpose. 
    After a disaster, the primary mission of the town will be to clear public streets, restore governmental services and protect lives and property. Owing to the magnitude of the disaster and after accomplishment of the primary mission, resources may be available to the town that may not be available to the private property owner. The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a process by which the town may evaluate and, if necessary, remove debris from along the curb of privately owned streets, roads, roadways, and other private property in the event of an immediate threat to life, public health and safety after a significant disaster. While the town recognizes that, as a general proposition, the removal of debris from private property is the responsibility of the property owner, there are occasions when, because of the magnitude of the disaster and the threat posed to life, health and safety, there may be a compelling need to remove debris from private streets, roads, and roadways as well as other private property as described in this chapter.

56.03 - Private roadways. 
    The town shall remove debris from private roadways when such debris is determined to be a public nuisance that poses an immediate threat and imperils the health, safety and welfare of the community. The town manager shall determine whether there is a sufficient immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare in accordance with any one of the following standards: 
(A)  Whether there is a significant likelihood that rescue vehicles will be significantly hindered from rendering emergency services to residential and commercial property should the debris be allowed to remain in place absent town removal. 
(B)  The type of debris is such that it may reasonably cause illness, sickness or disease which could injure or adversely affect the health, safety or general welfare of those residing and working in the area if it is allowed to remain.

Such costs may include, but are not limited to, the cost to conduct the renourishment and maintenances activities referenced in section 92.41 of the Code of Ordinances; the cost of the referendum for both the Gulfside District and the Bayside District, if applicable, to approve the bonds or other obligations to finance or refinance the renourishment and maintenance activities, including expenses incidental to the issuance of bonds or other obligations; the cost of the bonds or other obligations to finance or refinance the renourishment and maintenance activities, including expenses incidental to the issuance of bonds or other obligations; the cost of the debt service on the bonds or other obligations necessary to finance or refinance the renourishment and maintenance activities, including the establishment of an appropriate reserve; the cost of the town's administrative support for the Gulfside District; all costs, referendums, and other activities associated with the Bayside District; and any other costs associated with maintaining the high quality standards established by the town commission for the town's beaches. Following a request from the Gulfside District, the town commission may issue bonds in accordance with article I, section 5 of the Town Charter, or other obligations, subject to referendum approval by the voters within the Gulfside District, payable from ad valorem taxes levied within the Gulfside District which mature more than 12 months after issuance to finance or refinance capital projects in the manner and to the extent heretofore described. The ad valorem taxes, and related bonds, requested by the Gulfside District, shall be assessed and issued only to further the specific purpose of beach restoration and maintenance activities set forth in sections 92.40-92.48 of the Code of Ordinances and for financing and refinancing purposes. The town commission shall maintain the exclusive power and authority to borrow money for the purposes of the Gulfside District. The town manager and town finance director shall annually present a written budgetary request on behalf of the Gulfside District to the Town Commission of the Town of Longboat Key by June 1, for the Gulfside District funding. Said request shall include a computation of the funds needed within the Gulfside District and Bayside District, if any, for the upcoming fiscal year so as to meet all the obligations set forth herein.

92.67 - Financing. 
    In recognition of the fact that the town's beaches are a town-wide asset benefiting all town property owners and residents irrespective of their proximate location to the Gulf of Mexico, the town commission finds that the levy of ad valorem taxes is the most equitable method available to fairly apportion the costs associated with conducting beach renourishment, beach protection, and erosion prevention, and fund the on-going operating and maintenance, and administrative support, costs associated with maintaining the town's beaches. The Bayside District is authorized to request the town commission levy within the boundaries of the Bayside District ad valorem taxes to pay a percentage of the costs to finance and refinance the construction, reconstruction, and improvement of beach renourishment, beach protection and erosion prevention projects, and the operation and maintenance, and administrative support, costs associated with maintaining high quality beach conditions. Such costs may include, but are not limited to, the cost to conduct the renourishment and maintenances activities referenced in section 92.61 of the Code of Ordinances; the cost of the referendum for both the Gulfside District and the Bayside District, if applicable, to approve the bonds or other obligations to finance or refinance the renourishment and maintenance activities, including expenses incidental to the issuance of bonds or other obligations; the cost of the bonds or other obligations to finance or refinance the renourishment and maintenance activities, including expenses incidental to the issuance of bonds or other obligations; the cost of the debt service on the bonds or other obligations necessary to finance or refinance the renourishment and maintenance activities, including the establishment of an appropriate reserve; the cost of the town's administrative support for the Bayside District; and any other costs associated with maintaining the high quality standards established by the town commission for the town's beaches. Unless a majority of voters voting in a referendum election in the Bayside District fail to approve the issuance of debt for beach district financing and refinancing purposes, the Bayside District's total contribution for the funding of the town's beach renourishment, operation and maintenance activities, and costs shall be 20 percent of the combined millage rate for both the Gulfside and Bayside Districts. Any change to the Bayside District's total combined millage contribution percentage for such financings or re-financings shall require a public referendum. Following a request from the Bayside District, the town commission may issue bonds in accordance with article I, section 5 of the Town Charter, or other obligations, subject to referendum approval by the voters within the Bayside District, payable from ad valorem taxes levied within the Bayside District which mature more than 12 months after issuance to finance or refinance capital projects in the manner and to the extent heretofore described. The ad valorem taxes, and related bonds, requested by the Bayside District, shall be assessed and issued only to further the specific purpose of beach restoration and maintenance activities set forth in sections 92.60-92.68 of the Code of Ordinances and for financing and refinancing purposes. The town commission shall maintain the exclusive power and authority to borrow money for the purposes of the Bayside District. The town manager and town finance director shall annually present a written budgetary request on behalf of the Bayside District to the Town Commission of the Town of Longboat Key by June 1, for the Bayside District funding. Said request shall include a computation of the funds needed within the Gulfside District and Bayside District, if any, for the upcoming fiscal year so as to meet the obligations set forth herein.

(A)  The purpose of this section shall be to regulate and control the malfunctioning, negligence, or unintentional act resulting in false fire alarms and the unnecessary response thereto of emergency vehicles. In the case of false alarms, the authority having jurisdiction shall cause an investigation to be made and keep a record of such alarms on file. 
(B)  As set forth in subsection (A) of this section, false fire alarms will result in the assessment of fees as set by resolution of the town commission. 
(C)  The fire chief may waive the assessment of additional warnings or fines as provided in subsection (B) of this section, for false alarms occurring within 24 hours subsequent to an initial false alarm in order to provide a reasonable time for repair of a fire alarm system. Such waiver shall only be granted when the fire chief determines that repairs to the system could not have reasonably been made prior to the subsequent false alarm(s). 
(D)  The fire dhief may waive the assessment of a warning or fine as provided in subsection (B) of this section if the fire chief determines that a false alarm was caused by severe weather conditions. 
(E)  In the event of excessive false alarms (six or more occurring within a calendar year) and when the responsible party has made a "good faith effort" to correct the problem which has caused the excessive number of false alarms; the authority having jurisdiction may reduce by 50 percent the total fees due and payable as set forth in subsection (B) of this section. The determination of a "good faith effort" shall be made by the authority having jurisdiction based upon the following criteria: 
(1)  Submission of a written request for reduction of fees; 
(2)  Submission of a written detailed plan of action to address and remedy the problem in the fire alarm systems and approval of such plan by the authority having jurisdiction; 
(3)  Documentation that the plan of action submitted has been put into effect and shall continue in the future including, but not limited to, inspection and maintenance agreements, system repair/replacement agreements, etc.; and 
(4)  The frequency of false alarms has been reduced. 
(F)  Fire alarm systems in new buildings and existing fire alarm systems in existing buildings where substantial modification has occurred, may be allowed a 90-day "grace period" whereby no false alarms will be counted for assessment of fees when a "good faith effort," as set forth in subsection (E) above, is being made upon the part of the responsible party to remove "start-up" problems with the system.

2.  Areas seaward of the frontal dune, or the beach in areas where the frontal dune no longer exists, are not directly, indirectly, or cumulatively illuminated. 
(B)  Exterior artificial light fixtures within direct line of sight of the beach are permitted if lights are completely shielded downlight-direct fixtures with non-reflective interior surfaces or completely recessed fixtures with non-reflective interior surfaces. These fixtures shall utilize FWC approved marine turtle fixtures and bulbs during marine turtle nesting season and shall be in compliance with subsection (A) of this section. 
(C)  All fixtures shall be mounted as low in elevation when possible through use of low-mounted wall fixtures, low-profile luminaries, low bollards, and ground-level fixtures. 
(D)  Floodlights, uplights, spotlights, or decorative lighting in which the point source of artificial light or any reflective interior surface of the light fixture is directly visible from the beach, or which directly, indirectly, or cumulatively illuminate the beach are prohibited. All light fixtures on floodlights, uplights, spotlights, or decorative lighting shall utilize FWC approved marine turtle bulbs during marine turtle nesting season. 
(E)  The use of motion-detecting lighting devices that keep artificial lights off except when approached are required for all exterior lights used expressly for safety or security during marine turtle nesting season. All motion-detecting lighting devices shall be set to the minimum duration possible for illumination according to the manufacturers specifications for the device during marine turtle nesting season. 
(F)  Dune crosswalks may be lighted. If lighted, dune crosswalks shall utilize low-profile, completely shielded luminaries, with non-reflective interior surfaces directed and positioned so that the point source of artificial light or any reflective interior surface of the light fixture is not directly visible from the beach. All light fixtures on dune crosswalks shall utilize FWC approved marine turtle fixtures and bulbs during marine turtle nesting season. Dune crosswalk lighting seaward of the frontal dune, or on the beach in areas where the frontal dune no longer exists, shall be prohibited. 
(G)  Parking areas within direct line-of-sight of the beach shall be designed with the minimum lighting necessary to provide safety and security and lighting shall be: 
1.  Downward-direct and completely shielded;

The cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall guarantee that the site will be either promptly restored to its original state so far as is possible in the event the construction is abandoned or the site secured in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the town and its inhabitants. In default thereof, the amount of the security shall be paid, on demand, to the town for its use in effecting the restoration or to secure the building site. Construction shall be deemed to have been abandoned if the applicant, or his successors or assigns, so notifies the planning, zoning and building department, in writing, or if work on the premises ceases prior to the completion of the improvement and is not resumed within 30 days of the expiration or revocation of the building permit. The cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall have an expiration date at least one year after the expected construction completion date as reflected on the building permit application. 
(1)  Permits for tree removal, clearing of the land (except debrushing), excavation, grading or installation of utilities shall not be issued nor undertaken in areas beyond the limits of the area necessary for the construction of the building for which a permit has been issued. The building official shall determine, in writing, the limits of the area necessary for the satisfactory completion of the permitted work, and such determination shall be deemed a condition of the permit. The necessary construction area shall be fenced to avoid damage to other areas. 
(2)  Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b), below, temporary use permits shall not be issued prior to issuance of a building permit for construction. 
(a)  Temporary use permits for real estate sales offices may be allowed prior to construction of the underlying project, subject to site restoration guarantee requirements in section 150.19 (A) above, regardless of the cost of improvements, for certain qualifying projects meeting all of the following criteria: 
1.  The property exceeds five acres; 
2.  The underlying project has a minimum of 40 multi-family units; and 
3.  The underlying project has received approval, per a signed development order, resolution, or ordinance. 
(b)  Temporary real estate offices that are permitted prior to construction of the underlying project shall terminate on the earlier to occur of: 
1.  The date that the certificate of occupancy of the underlying project has been issued; 
2.  The abandonment of the underlying project; 
3.  The expiration of one year from the date of issuance of the temporary use permit, unless extended by the planning and zoning department (which extensions may be issued in increments not to exceed six months). 
(B)  In the event the applicant, his successors, or assigns fail to restore or secure the site prior to abandonment, the town shall notify the applicant and his guarantor, or security agent, as the case may be, by certified mail, addressed to the last address furnished by the parties to the town, demanding performance or the deposit of the guarantee sum. Not later than ten days after the posting by the town of the demand, the applicant or his guarantor, or security agent shall deposit in the office of the planning, zoning and building department the sum demanded by the town, either the estimated cost of restoring the site to its original condition as nearly as possible or the full sum of the secured obligation in the event the restoration costs or cost to secure the building site would exceed the amount of the security or if restoration is impossible or impracticable. 
(C)  In the event there is a surplus in the deposit made on the town's demand, after restoration of the site, the town shall refund to the depositor the surplus after costs and expenses. If the amount received by the town is insufficient to restore the site, the applicant shall not be relieved of his obligation to complete the improvement or restore the site and the applicant shall, upon further demand by the town, deposit the additional amount necessary to restore the site. 
(D)  Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the town from seeking any and all remedies available to it under local, state or federal law.

The building official shall have the authority to authorize disconnection of utility service to the structure or equipment regulated by this Code in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property or when such utility connection has been made without approval. The building official shall notify the serving utility and, whenever possible, the owner and occupant of the structure or equipment of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified prior to disconnection the owner or occupant of the structure or equipment shall be notified by certified mail with return receipt requested and first class mail within five calendar days of disconnection. The service utilities shall not thereafter be reconnected without approval from the building official. Any notice of appeal to the town commission filed relating to the utility disconnection order must be filed within ten calendar days from receipt of the mailed notice and shall proceed as provided for in subsection (I) of this section. 
(E)  Notice of unsafe or unfit structures or equipment and manner of service. Whenever the building official has verified the existence of an unsafe or unfit structure or equipment under the provisions of this section, the building official shall determine the owner of record as defined in this section and shall notify the owner of record and interested parties that the structure or equipment is in violation of this Code. 
(1)  Written notice. The building official shall send a notice to the owner of record and interested parties, by certified mail with return receipt requested and by first class mail. The notice shall describe the unsafe or unfit conditions, and shall indicate that these conditions must be corrected within a reasonable time frame as determined by the building official and as specified in the notice, or else the structure or equipment shall be subject to abatement as provided in this section. The notice shall also indicate that a building or demolition permit must be secured prior to the commencement of any corrective work, including repair and/or replacement, or demolition and removal. 
(2)  Placarding. In addition to sending notice to the owner of record and interested parties, the building official shall post on the premises or on defective equipment a placard bearing the words "This structure or equipment is unsafe or unfit for human habitation" at the primary entrance or entrances to the structure. The placard shall also include a statement of the penalties provided for occupying the premises, operating the equipment, or removing the placard. 
(3)  Placard removal. Once a structure or equipment has been placarded, it shall be unlawful for any person to enter such structure or use such equipment except for the purposes of making the required repairs or demolishing it. However, if the structure is occupied at the time of placarding, it shall be vacated within 14 calendar days. Otherwise, no person shall occupy or let another person occupy such a placarded structure. The owner shall immediately begin action to vacate the structure and bring it into compliance within the time prescribed. Any person who defaces or removes a placard without the approval of the building official shall be subject to the penalties provided by this Code. The placard shall remain until such time as the building official orders the placard to be removed. 
(4)  Prohibited occupancy. Any occupied structure placarded by the building official shall be vacated as ordered by the building official. Any person who shall occupy placarded premises or shall operate placarded equipment, and any owner or interested parties responsible for the premises who shall let anyone occupy placarded premises or operate placarded equipment shall be liable for the penalties provided by this Code. 
(F)  Abatement methods. The owner of record or other interested parties of a structure or equipment deemed unsafe or unfit by the building official shall abate or cause to be abated or corrected such unsafe or unfit conditions either by repair, rehabilitation, demolition, or other approved corrective action. Prior to taking any corrective action to abate the unsafe or unfit condition, the owner of record or interested parties shall secure a building or demolition permit. 
(G)  Extension. If the owner of record or interested parties is unable to complete the work by the date ordered or to fully comply with the notice of unsafe or unfit structure or equipment, a written request may be filed to the building official stating the reasons for the delay, and if justifiable cause is demonstrated as merited by special hardship, unusual difficulty or unique problems such as preserving significant portions and features of a structure of historic or architectural value, the building official is hereby authorized to grant written reasonable extensions of time to comply. 
(1)  An extension to comply in excess of 30 calendar days shall be by compliance agreement with the owner of record, in a form approved by the town attorney and signed by the owner of record, the building official and town manager, for the abatement of the unsafe or unfit structure or equipment. Such agreement shall be controlling and will govern the subsequent course of action to abate the unsafe or unfit conditions through repair and/or rehabilitation work or demolition. 
(2)  All repair and/or rehabilitation work or demolition shall require the appropriate building or demolition permits. All work shall conform to the minimum requirements of this Code. 
(3)  A compliance agreement shall establish completion dates for the submittal of permit documents and for the completion of repair and/or rehabilitation or demolition. The compliance agreement shall provide for the demolition and removal of the unsafe or unfit structure or equipment by the town if the completion dates are not met.

(3)  A copy of the condemnation order and notice of intent to demolish shall also be served on any person or entity determined from official public records to have a legal interest in the property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure of the building official to serve any such person or entity other than the owner of record shall not invalidate any proceedings hereunder. 
(4)  A condemnation order and notice of intent to demolish shall be recorded with the public records of the county in which the unsafe or unfit structure or equipment is located. 
(5)  Ten calendar days prior to authorizing the demolition of any unsafe or unfit structure or equipment by the town, a notice of intent to demolish shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the unsafe or unfit structures or equipment is located. Such notice shall be substantially in the following form: 
NOTICE OF INTENT TO DEMOLISH

Except in cases of emergency demolition as set forth in subsection (J) below, appeals may be taken by the owner of record or other parties who have been aggrieved by the following building official orders: order to secure vacant structure(s) or equipment, order to disconnect utility service, or a condemnation order and notice of intent to demolish. Except in cases of emergency demolition, the filing of an appeal shall stay the building official's demolition order, and the stay shall continue until such time as the town commission has issued a written decision on the appeal and/or a compliance agreement has been entered into by the parties. 
(1)  Appeals of a building official must be submitted in writing to the town manager within ten calendar days from the date of receipt of the order. At a minimum the written appeal must contain the following information:

(4)  At the hearing, the owner and other aggrieved parties, if present, shall be afforded the opportunity to be heard concerning the structure, equipment or property, after which the town commission may hear testimony from the public concerning the status of the structure, equipment or property. Any owner of record or other aggrieved party may appear in person, by counsel, or by an authorized agent. 
(5)  Following the public hearing on the appeal, town commission may elect to: 
(a)  Uphold the building official's order and decision; or 
(b)  Modify the building official's decision, in whole or in part; or 
(c)  Reverse the decision or interpretation by the building official; or 
(d)  Authorize the entering into a compliance agreement with the owner of record for the abatement of the unsafe or unfit structure or equipment or open and vacant structure pursuant to certain agreed upon terms and subsection (G) of this section. 
(6)  In evaluating the merits of the appeal and determining whether to modify or reverse the building official's decision, the town commission shall evaluate whether the literal enforcement of the Code or decision by the building official would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of the Code or public interest, and consider the following; 
(a)  Any evidence presented by the appellant that the unsafe and/or unfit conditions do not exist; and 
(b)  Any evidence presented by the appellant that the unsafe and/or unfit structure or equipment does not present a danger to any persons or property nearby; and 
(c)  Whether the grant of a modification or reversal of the building official's decision will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this Code; and

(7)  The town commission shall enter a written decision relating to the appeal. The town manager shall advise the owner of record and other aggrieved parties in writing of the town commission's action by first class mail. 
(8)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the town commission may apply to the circuit court for judicial relief within 30 days after rendition of the decision.

In cases where there is imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare, or immediate danger to the life or safety of any person, or where the public or their property is endangered by wind, storm, fire, or other natural disasters, or where a structure is in imminent danger of collapse from structural decay, the building official shall promptly cause such structure or equipment to be made safe or cause its removal. For this purpose, the building official and fire marshal may at once enter such a structure or the land on which such structure or equipment stands or abutting land or structures, to perform an inspection with such assistance and at such costs as they may deem necessary. 
(1)  Upon inspection, the building official and the fire marshal shall jointly determine whether or not the structure or equipment requires immediate emergency demolition to maintain the public's health, safety and welfare. A written report will document the results of these inspections.

(3)  Upon determination by the building official and the fire marshal to proceed with demolition, exterior and interior photographs of the structure or equipment will be taken when deemed feasible by the building official and fire marshal. 
(4)  Written notification of intent to demolish the structure or equipment shall be sent by certified mail with return receipt requested and by first class mail to the owner of record. This written notification shall document the cause for demolition. However, failure to effect personal notice upon the owner of record shall not prevent the town from demolishing the structure and placing a lien on the property for all town costs associated with the demolition and removal. 
(5)  Written notification of intent to demolish the structure or equipment shall also be sent by certified mail with return receipt requested and by first class mail to interested parties and any person or entity determined from the official public records to have a legal interest in the property. This written notification shall document the cause for demolition. However, failure to effect personal notice upon interested parties or any persons or entities determined from the official public records to have a legal interest in the property, shall not prevent the town from demolishing the structure and placing a lien on the property for all town costs associated with the demolition and removal. 
(6)  Emergency demolition orders shall not be afforded an appeal to the town commission. Any appeal must be filed to the appropriate circuit court within ten calendar days of the date the notification of intent to demolish is mailed. Nothing herein shall prevent the building official from demolishing and removing the structure(s) or equipment prior to the end of the appeal period. 
(K)  Authority to order rodent and pest control. When the building official verifies the existence of rodent and/or pest infestation in a structure that is to be demolished, the building official may require that a licensed pest control operator exterminate the rodents and/or pests to preclude the migration of such rodents and/or pests. 
(L)  Condition of lot after demolition. A lot from which a structure or equipment is demolished and removed shall be sodded or seeded with grass, or otherwise covered with vegetative landscaping within five calendar days of the completion of demolition. 
(M)  Assessment of costs of abatement and/or demolition and lien on property. The building official shall assess the entire cost of repair, rehabilitation, boarding up or securing, demolition, removal, asbestos abatement, sodding or seeding, vegetative landscaping, rodent and/or pest extermination, and any other costs associated with abatement of unsafe or unfit conditions against the real property where the conditions existed in the form of a lien. To the extent permitted by applicable law, this lien shall be superior to all others except property taxes and shall include all administrative costs, including but not limited to expert reports or assessments, postal expenses, the cost of newspaper publications, and similar expenses incurred by the town. 
(1)  A lien shall be filed in the county's official record book for the county where the real property is located and shall show the nature of such lien, the amount thereof, and an accurate legal description of the property, including street address and the date of filing, and shall recite the names of all owners of record and interested parties notified. Such lien shall bear interest from such date at the rate of ten percent per annum and may be enforceable if unsatisfied after the expiration of one year from the date of filing. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the town may elect to charge any and all costs described in this section against any applicable bond or surety for the property that the town may hold. 
(3)  In addition to filing a lien and/or charging against a bond or surety, when the town abates unsafe or unfit conditions the town retains the right to sell any salvaged materials at the highest price obtainable. The net proceeds of such sale, after deducting all costs indicated herein, shall be promptly remitted with a report of such sale or transaction, including items of expense and the amounts deducted, for the person or entity who is entitled thereto, subject to any order of the court. If such a surplus does not remain to be turned over, the report shall so state. 
(N)  Civil remedies. The remedies available to the town within this section are non-exclusive. Nothing herein shall preclude the town commission from seeking other available civil remedies to protect the public from dangerous, unsafe or unfit structures or equipment or conditions. The town commission reserves its right to initiate in a court of competent jurisdiction litigation to abate any dangerous, unsafe or unfit structure, equipment or condition that is harmful to the persons or property within the town.

Chapter 151 - SHORELINE CONSTRUCTION 

151.01 - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning: 
    "Buttress." A projecting structure for supporting, shoring up, or giving stability to a seawall. 
    "Coastal construction." Any work or activity within the town on its gulf beaches which is likely to have a material physical effect on existing coastal conditions or natural shore processes. 
    "Comprehensive beach management plan or beach comprehensive management plan." That plan prepared by coastal planning and engineering (CP&E 1996), as amended from time to time, and which is made a part of this chapter by reference and is on file in the office of the town clerk. 
    "Construction." An act or process that involves the erection, fabrication, installation, alteration, repair, maintenance, demolition or removal of any structure or part of a structure. 
    "Engineer." A professional engineer registered in the State of Florida. 
    "Repairs." Modifications to mend or fix existing seawalls where the seawall has not lost its structural integrity. 
    "Replacement." Installation of a new seawall which is the substantial equivalent of the structure being supplanted in its original condition. If a seawall has collapsed or otherwise lost its structural integrity for a period of greater than six months, an application shall be treated as new seawall construction. 
    "Revetment." A sloping covering of stone or other similar material to hold in place a shoreline. 
    "Seawall." Vertical wall, retaining walls, bulkheads, or embankment for checking the encroachment of the gulf, bay, canal, bayou, pass or lagoon or for use as a breakwater or to retain property. 
    "Shoreline construction." Any work or activity within the town on its shores which is likely to have a material physical effect on existing shoreline conditions or natural shore processes; includes coastal construction. 
    "Wetlands" means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and a duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soils. Soils present in wetlands generally are classified as hydric or alluvial, or possess characteristics that are associated with reducing soil conditions. The prevalent vegetation in wetlands generally consists of facultative or obligate hydrophytic macrophytes that are typically adapted to areas having soil conditions described above. These species, due to morphological, physiological, or reproductive adaptations, have the ability to grow, reproduce, or persist in aquatic environments or anaerobic soil conditions. Florida wetlands generally include swamps, sloughs, marshes, wet prairies, bayheads, bogs, cypress domes and strands, riverine swamps and marshes, hydric seepage slopes, tidal marshes, saltwater swamps, and other similar areas. The extent of wetlands is delineated according to the methodology in Florida Administrative Code Rule 62-340.300, as amended from time to time.

154.101 - General. 
(A)  Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the Town of Longboat Key ("town"), hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance." 
(B)  Scope. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to, the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(C)  Intent. The purpose of this ordinance and the flood load and flood-resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code is to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, § 59.22. 
(D)  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(E)  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, §§ 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance. 
(F)  Disclaimer of liability. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the town or any of its past or present officials, officers, employees or agents for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. 2013-25, passed 1-6-14) 
154.102. - Applicability. 
(A)  General. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 
(B)  Areas to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the town, as established in § 154.102(C) of this ordinance. 
(C)  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The Flood Insurance Study for Manatee County, Florida and Incorporated Areas, dated March 17, 2014, and the Flood Insurance Study for Sarasota County, Florida, and incorporated areas, dated September 3, 1992, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this ordinance and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at Town of Longboat Key Town Hall, 501 Bay Isles Road, Longboat Key, Florida 34228: 
(1)  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to § 154.105 of this ordinance the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
(a)  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this ordinance and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(b)  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
(D)  Other laws. The provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
(E)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including, but not limited to, land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this ordinance and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This ordinance shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this ordinance. 
(F)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

(2)  Determination by the Town of Longboat Key Zoning Board of Adjustment that: 
(a)  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
(b)  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
(c)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court, in the county the property is situated in, in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

(1)  A deck that is structurally attached to a building or structure shall have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member at or above the design flood elevation and any supporting members that extend below the design flood elevation shall comply with the foundation requirements that apply to the building or structure, which shall be designed to accommodate any increased loads resulting from the attached deck. 
(2)  A deck or patio that is located below the design flood elevation shall be structurally independent from buildings or structures and their foundation systems, and shall be designed and constructed either to remain intact and in place during design flood conditions or to break apart into small pieces to minimize debris during flooding that is capable of causing structural damage to the building or structure or to adjacent buildings and structures. 
(3)  A deck or patio that has a vertical thickness of more than 12 inches or that is constructed with more than the minimum amount of fill necessary for site drainage shall not be approved unless an analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional demonstrates no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave run-up and wave reflection that would increase damage to the building or structure or to adjacent buildings and structures. 
(4)  A deck or patio that has a vertical thickness of 12 inches or less and that is at natural grade or on nonstructural fill material that is similar to and compatible with local soils and is the minimum amount necessary for site drainage may be approved without requiring analysis of the impact on diversion of floodwaters or wave run-up and wave reflection. 
(D)  Other development in coastal high hazard areas (Zone V). In coastal high hazard areas, development activities other than buildings and structures shall be permitted only if also authorized by the appropriate federal, state or local authority; if located outside the footprint of, and not structurally attached to, buildings and structures; and if analyses prepared by qualified registered design professionals demonstrate no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave run-up and wave reflection that would increase damage to adjacent buildings and structures. Such other development activities include but are not limited to: 
(1)  Bulkheads, seawalls, retaining walls, revetments, and similar erosion control structures; 
(2)  Solid fences and privacy walls, and fences prone to trapping debris, unless designed and constructed to fail under flood conditions less than the design flood or otherwise function to avoid obstruction of floodwaters; and

156.01 - Findings, purpose and intent; interpretation. 
(A)  Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive, and harmonious community, and economic development. This article allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size, and purpose of all signs. This article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this chapter is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision. 
(B)  Any person seeking to display a permanent sign regulated by this chapter is required to apply for and obtain a sign permit prior to lawful placement of the sign structure and sign. Any sign that is not authorized or exempt from the requirements of this chapter is prohibited. 
(C)  A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection, or directing persons to a use conducted therein shall be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this chapter is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building, or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in subsection (A) of this section. 
(D)  These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape, and architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition. 
(E)  These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the town. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above. 
(F)  These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs. 
(G)  These regulations are not intended to and do not apply to signs erected, maintained or otherwise posted, owned or leased by the state, the federal government or the town. The inclusion of "government" in describing some signs does not intend to subject the government to regulation, but instead helps explain the type of sign that falls within the immunities of the government from regulation.

157.32 - Boundary adjustment, lot split, or lot consolidation. 
    The intent of this section is to provide an administrative process by which abutting lots may make minor boundary adjustments, for the division of one existing lot into a maximum of two legally conforming lots, and for consolidation of multiple existing abutting lots into a maximum of two legally conforming lots. 
    Abutting lots or portions thereof may be consolidated in accordance with this section so long as doing so will not result in the creation of a new or increased nonconformity. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that adjacent lots be consolidated pursuant to this section in order to be developed in common. 
(A)  Approval. The town manager or his/her designee may administratively approve boundary adjustments, the division of one existing lot into a maximum of two legally conforming lots, and the consolidation of multiple existing abutting lots into a maximum of two legally conforming lots, when the following conditions are satisfied: 
(1)  Each created or consolidated parcel meets the zoning standards of the property's zoning classification without the necessity of a variance, and in cases of an existing nonconforming lot of record, the adjustment shall not increase the nonconformity of the lot; 
(2)  Each parcel has a net buildable acreage equal to the minimum lot size requirement of the applicable zoning classification; 
(3)  Parcels have the required road frontage; 
(4)  The addition of impervious area will not impact the stormwater system of the area; 
(5)  Easements and access for public services and utilities are provided, if necessary; 
(6)  There are no variances, easements, or other restrictions which would prevent the boundary adjustment, lot split, or lot consolidation. 
(B)  Submittal requirements. The applicant(s) shall be required to submit the following documentation, along with the appropriate fees, to the planning, zoning and building department for review: 
(1)  A completed application provided by the Town of Longboat Key;

(3)  Two signed and sealed boundary surveys showing the parcel(s) or lot(s) to be reconfigured, prepared by a Florida registered professional land surveyor and shall include the following information: 
(a)  Existing legal descriptions, boundary survey, dimensions of the lot(s) and/or parcel(s) to be reconfigured. All existing easements and rights-of-way must be indicated. 
(b)  For the new lot(s) and/or parcel(s), legal descriptions and proposed dimensions of the lot and/or parcel. 
(c)  The boundary survey shall indicate that its purpose is for a boundary adjustment, lot split, or lot consolidation. 
(d)  The boundary survey shall be drawn at a legible scale and shall be bold enough to remain clearly legible after reduction. Additional detail may be required by the planning, zoning and building department. 
1.  A written statement of buildings, if any, to be demolished; 
2.  Any other information as requested by staff. 
(C)  Recording. Upon administrative approval, a copy of the boundary adjustment application and associated documents, along with the signed and sealed survey, will be recorded by the town, at the applicant's expense, in the public records of the county in which the property is located. 
(D)  Nothing herein shall constitute the platting or replatting of a subdivision. Any boundary adjustment, lot split, or lot consolidation resulting in the division of land into three or more lots must comply with the subdivision plat process established in this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all lots utilizing the administrative approval process described herein must be in compliance with all provisions of this Code related to the development of land.

157.43 - Dedication of land to public use. 
    Whenever the plat proposes the dedication of land to public use and the appropriate agency finds that the land is not required or suitable for public use, the town may either refuse to approve the plat or it may require the rearrangement of lots to include the land. 
('71 Code, Appendix A, § 7.32) 
157.44 - Blocks. 
(A)  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to the following: 
(1)  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated. 
(2)  Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions unless a planned unit development is contemplated. 
(3)  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
(4)  Limitations and opportunities of topography and other natural features. 
(B)  In general, residential blocks should not be greater than 1,400 feet in length, depending on land configuration. Residential blocks shall be wide enough to provide two tiers of lots, except where fronting on major thoroughfares or prevented by physiographical conditions, size, or configuration of property, in which case the town may require or approve a single tier of lots of minimum depth.

Every residential lot shall conform to at least the minimum dimension and area requirement of the zoning code. 
(B)  Every lot in every district shall have a minimum frontage of 40 feet on a public or approved private street. Double frontage, unless required by the town, shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography, orientation, and property size. A planting screen reservation of at least ten feet in width and across which there shall be no right of access, may be required along the line of lots abutting a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use. This reservation shall be in addition to other setback requirements. 
(C)  Corner lots shall have an extra width at least 15 percent greater than the required minimum to permit appropriate building setbacks from and orientation to both streets and sight triangles. 
(D)  Lot remnants (lots below minimum area or width left over after subdividing tracts of land) shall be prohibited. The remnant areas shall be added to adjacent lots, rather than remain as unusable parcels. 
(E)  The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide each lot with direct abutting access to an existing public street or to a street contained within the proposed subdivision, provided that individual lots, except in unusual circumstances, shall not front on an arterial street as defined in section 157.03. 
(F)  Lots shall be situated so that storm water may be easily directed away from buildings in subsequent site-specific development. Lots shall be configured so that buildings and general flood sensitive site facilities can be located out of drainage ways. Subdivisions shall be designed so as to comply with the requirements of the comprehensive plan, and applicable standards of the Southwest Florida Water Management District. 
(G)  Minimum lot widths shall be maintained between the front and rear yard setback lines (see Appendix: Subdivision Regulations, subsection 1(A)). 
(H)  Addressing and lot numbering. The town manager or designee shall determine a method of street addressing/lot numbering. Applicants should consult with the town for site-specific review. 
(I)  Sight triangle easements shall be required and shall include the area on each street corner that is bounded by the line which connects the sight or "connecting" points located on each of the right-of-way lines of the intersecting street. No structure or plantings (at mature growth) which exceed three feet in height above the street grade shall be permitted within the sight triangle. Exceptions are permitted for trees if the lower canopy of the trees allow a clear line of sight between three feet and seven feet above the street grade and the trunks of such trees are sufficiently spaced or are so located as to be unlikely to substantially interrupt the line of sight. A public right-of-entry shall be reserved for the purpose of removing any object material or otherwise, that obstructs the clear sight (see Appendix: Subdivision Regulations, subsection 1(B)).

Article I. - General Provisions 

158.001 - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known and cited as the Town of Longboat Key Zoning Code, which may, in subsequent sections of this chapter, be referred to as the Zoning Code. 
(Ord. 90-06, passed 3-19-90) 
158.002 - Purpose. 
(A)  The purpose of this chapter is to establish comprehensive controls for the development of land in the town based on the comprehensive plan, as defined in chapter 160, and designed to preserve the unique island character of the town and enacted in order to protect, promote and improve the public health, safety, comfort, order, appearance, convenience, morals and general welfare of the people; and to use and strengthen the town's role in establishing and implementing the comprehensive planning process in order to protect natural and man-made resources and to maintain, through orderly growth and development, the character and stability of present and future land use and community development. 
(B)  The objectives of this chapter are to provide: For efficiency and economy in the process of development; for the appropriate and best use of land, for preservation, protection, development and conservation of the natural resources of land, water and air; for convenience of traffic and circulation of people and goods; for the use and occupancy of buildings; to maintain an appropriate balance for the scale of buildings; to promote and protect safety, light, air, access, and enhancement of appearance; for healthful and convenient distribution of population; for adequate public facilities and utilities; for promotion of civic amenities of beauty and visual interest; and for development in accord with comprehensive plan. 
(C)  (1)  Height, number of stories, size, scale, interrelation among buildings and to the adjacent environment, bulk, location, erection, construction, repair, reconstruction, alteration and use of buildings and other structures, for trade, industry, residence and other purposes. 
(2)  Use of land and water for trade, profession, residence and other purposes. 
(3)  Size of yards and other open spaces. 
(4)  Percentage of lot that may be occupied. 
(5)  Density. 
(6)  Conditions under which various classes of nonconformities may continue. 
(7)  Use and types and sizes of structures in those areas subject to seasonal or periodic flooding so that danger to life and property in those areas will be minimized.

(D)  All regulations shall be uniform throughout each district, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts. Each district shall designate the permitted uses. 
(Ord. 90-06, passed 3-19-90; Amd. Ord. 97-09, passed 6-2-97) 
158.003 - Interpretation. 
    In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the protection, promotion and improvement of the public health, safety, comfort, order, appearance, convenience, morals and general welfare of the community. It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties. However, where this chapter imposes a greater restriction on the use of buildings or premises, or on the height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by other ordinances, rules, regulations, or by easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall control. If, because of error or omission in the zoning map, any property in the town not shown as being in a zoning district, the classification of the property shall be R-1SF unless changed by amendment to the zoning map or by subsequent zoning ordinances. 
(Ord. 90-06, passed 3-19-90) 
158.004 - Application. 
    Except as otherwise provided, the following restriction shall apply: 
    No building shall be erected and no existing building shall be moved, altered, added to, or enlarged, nor shall any land or building be designed, used, or intended to be used for any purpose or in any manner other than as permitted in the district in which the building or land is located. 
(Ord. 90-06, passed 3-19-90) 
158.005 - Relationship to the town's comprehensive plan. 
    The Local Government Comprehensive Planning Act of 1975, as amended by the Local Government Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, provide that adopted comprehensive plans have legal status, and that no public or private development be permitted except in conformity with that comprehensive plan. The above referenced acts also assign to local governments the responsibility for implementing adopted comprehensive plans by the adoption of land development regulations. All land development regulations enacted or amended, including this Zoning Code, shall be consistent with the town's adopted comprehensive plan or elements, or portion thereof. In the event that the regulations of this Zoning Code are inconsistent with any provisions of the town's comprehensive plan, the provisions of the town's comprehensive plan shall govern.

158.009 - Description of districts and district policies. 
(A)  Areas designated as Open Space (OS) on the Town of Longboat Key Zoning Map shall be regulated as to type and intensity of development by the following definitions: 
(1)  Open Space-Active (OS-A) is publicly-owned or controlled open space which is designed, used or intended to be used for recreational activities by residents and visitors with on-site improvements, structures or other active, player-oriented facilities such as playgrounds, ballfields, tennis courts and associated accessory facilities. Impervious surface coverage is limited to 30 percent of the lot or parcel. 
(2)  Open Space-Passive (OS-P) is publicly-owned or controlled open space which is designed, used or intended to be used primarily for less-active leisure pursuits, such as nature trails, nature centers and associated accessory structures such as restrooms, boardwalks, docks and parking areas (including ingress/egress aisles). Impervious surface coverage is limited to 15 percent of the lot or parcel. 
(3)  Open Space-Conservation (OS-C) is publicly-owned or controlled open space which is designed, used or intended to be used for the protection and management of natural areas or archaeological sites. These areas shall remain in their natural state with little or no disturbance. Structures are limited to improvements such as boardwalks, permeable pathways and signage necessary for conservation management, limited public access and resource related educational activities. 
(B)  Community Facility Institutional District (INS)-Established for lands accommodating public and semipublic facilities such as schools, government buildings, civic centers, worship centers, parks and recreation areas, cemeteries, fire, police, marine facilities, nursing homes, and emergency operation center facilities. Public facilities and utilities will be located to best maximize the efficiency of services provided, minimize costs, and minimize impacts on the natural environment. 
(C)  Island Preserve Residential District (R-1IP)-Established for islands surrounding the core of the barrier island. These areas shall not exceed a development intensity of one dwelling unit per five acres. This policy recognizes the inaccessibility of the area to the mainland, including the lack of any transportation linkage by land and therefore the total lack or any needed emergency services to the respective islands. Development shall be adequately supported by public services and facilities which shall be provided by the developer prior to construction of any habitable structures. 
(D)  Single-Family Low-Density Estate Residential District (R-1SF)-Established for single-family low-density residential estate development, including community residential homes with six or fewer residents plus staff per dwelling unit, at a density of one per acre and shall be restricted to development of single-family detached units with a density no greater than one dwelling unit per acre. This district is intended to protect and preserve opportunities for low-density single-family estates at a density of up to one unit per acre. This district is particularly adaptive to highly valued water-oriented sites along the bay, bayou or gulf. It provides for land area for accommodating a unique lifestyle which cannot be accommodated in the more dense residential areas. The district is designed to permit development compatible with the need for preserving an estate character and minimizing potential adverse impacts to fragile natural systems, including estuaries and the dune systems respectively. In areas where existing development is characterized by densities lower than one unit per acre, zoning policy shall be applied which assures that future development or redevelopment of such areas is consistent with prevailing densities. In this manner, opportunities for a range of relatively low estate densities shall be preserved, while minimizing potential disruption to open space and natural systems. 
(E)  Single-Family Low-Density Residential District (R-2SF)-Established for single-family low-density residential development, including community residential homes with six or fewer residents plus staff per dwelling unit, at a density of two dwelling units per acre and shall be restricted to development of single-family detached structure types with a density of not to exceed two dwelling units per acre. This district is intended to protect and preserve single-family residential areas with a density up to two units per acre. This district is generally adaptive to larger lots located along Gulf of Mexico Drive adjacent to saltwater bodies. It provides for land area for accommodating a unique lifestyle which cannot be accommodated in the more dense residential areas and is designed to permit development compatible with the need for preserving the established density pattern and minimizing potential adverse impacts to fragile natural systems. In areas where existing development is characterized by densities lower than two units per acre, zoning policy shall be applied which assures that future development or redevelopment of such areas is consistent with prevailing densities. In this manner opportunities for a range of relatively low densities shall be preserved while minimizing potential disruption to open space and natural systems. 
(F)  Single-Family Low-Medium-Density Residential District (R-3SF)-Established for low-medium-density residential development, including community residential homes with six or fewer residents plus staff per dwelling unit, for single-family detached dwelling units only and shall be developed, redeveloped and/or maintained as stable low-medium-density single-family detached residential neighborhoods with a density not to exceed three dwelling units per acre. It is the intent of this district to provide sufficient acreage for medium-density residential development which will be adequately supported by existing or anticipated future public services and facilities. Review of specific development densities shall be directed toward preserving stability of established residential areas. In addition, site plan review of specific development proposals shall provide for smooth transitions in residential densities. Generally, low-medium-density areas are located between the perimeter of low-density residential areas and areas designated for high-density residential concentrations or less restrictive nonresidential uses. Sufficient open space and landscaped screening and buffering systems shall be used to alleviate the potential adverse impacts of land use transition. 
(G)  Single-Family Medium-Density Residential District (R-4SF)-Established for medium-density residential development, including community residential homes with six or fewer residents plus staff per dwelling unit, for single-family detached units only and shall be developed, redeveloped and/or maintained as stable medium-density single-family detached residential neighborhoods with a density not to exceed four dwelling units per acre. It is the intent of this district to provide sufficient acreage for medium-density residential development which will be adequately supported by existing or anticipated future public services and facilities, with the intention of preserving the stability of established residential areas. Other considerations shall include the need to preserve natural hydrologic cycles and floodplain areas to the greatest reasonable extent. In addition, site plan review of specific development proposals shall provide for smooth transitions in residential densities. Generally, medium-density areas should be located between the perimeter of low-density residential areas and areas designated for high-density residential concentrations or less restrictive nonresidential uses. Sufficient open space and landscaped screening and buffering systems shall be used to alleviate the potential adverse impacts of land use transition. 
(H)  Single-Family High-Density Residential District (R-6SF)-Established for high-density residential development, including community residential homes with six or fewer residents plus staff per dwelling unit, for single-family detached dwelling units only, ranging up to a maximum of six units per acre. The high-density policy designation is intended to provide for high-density residential development which will be adequately supported by existing or anticipated public services and facilities and compatible with the surrounding area. The specific areas designated for high-density development should be developed to an intensity which is consistent with the carrying capacity of Gulf of Mexico Drive. Similarly, the site shall be provided with requisite urban services to support high density residential development. Development in the district should not be located along the narrow land corridor paralleling the dune system along the Gulf of Mexico, west of Gulf of Mexico Drive and within the highest velocity zone of hurricanes as represented in the federal flood insurance rate maps. Specific density of future development proposals within these areas shall provide for smooth transition in residential density, preserve stability of established residential areas, and shall include sufficient open space, parking and landscaping to reinforce goals and objectives for quality living areas. 
(I)  Low-Medium-Density Mixed Residential District (R-3MX)-Established for low-medium-density residential development, including community residential homes, with mixed structure types and may develop with a mixture of single-family detached dwelling units as well as multiple-family dwelling units with a density not to exceed three dwelling units per acre. It is the intent of this district to provide for sufficient acreage for medium-density residential development which will be adequately supported by existing or anticipated future public services and facilities. Review of specific development densities shall be directed toward preserving stability of established residential areas. In addition, site plan review of specific development proposals shall provide for smooth transitions in residential densities. Generally, low-medium-density areas are located between the perimeter of low-density residential areas and areas designated for high-density residential concentrations or less restrictive nonresidential uses. Sufficient open space and landscaped screening and buffering systems shall be used to alleviate the potential adverse impacts of land use transition. 
(J)  Medium-Density Mixed Residential District (R-4MX)-Established for medium-density residential development, including community residential homes, with mixed structure types and may develop with detached single-family units, multiple-family units, a mixture of single-family detached dwelling units as well as multiple-family dwelling units with a density not to exceed four dwelling units per acre. It is the density residential development which will be adequately supported by existing or anticipated future public services and facilities, with the intention of preserving the stability of established residential areas. Other considerations shall include the need to [preserve natural hydrologic cycles and floodplain areas to the] greatest reasonable extent. In addition, site plan review of specific development proposals shall provide for smooth transitions in residential densities. Generally, medium-density areas should be located between the perimeter of low-density residential areas and areas designated for high-density residential concentrations or less restrictive nonresidential uses. Sufficient open space and landscaped screening and buffering systems shall be used to alleviate the potential adverse impacts of land use transition. 
(K)  High-Density Mixed Residential District (R-6MX)-Established for high-density residential development, including community residential homes, with mixed structure types and may develop with detached single-family units, multiple-family units, a mixture of single-family detached dwelling units as well as multiple-family dwelling units ranging up to a maximum of six units per acre. The high-density policy designation is intended to provide for high-density residential development which will be adequately supported by existing or anticipated public services and facilities, and compatible with the surrounding area. The specific areas designated for high-density development should be developed to an intensity which is consistent with the carrying capacity of Gulf of Mexico Drive. Similarly, the site shall be provided with requisite urban services to support high-density residential development. Development in the district shall not be located along the narrow land corridor paralleling the dune system along the Gulf of Mexico, west of Gulf of Mexico Drive and within the highest velocity zone of hurricanes as represented in the federal flood insurance rate maps, except as otherwise provided for in this chapter. Specific density of future development proposals within these areas shall provide for smooth transition in residential density, preserve stability of established residential areas, and shall include sufficient open space, parking and landscaping to reinforce goals and objectives for quality living areas. 
(L)  Mixed Use Community - Bay Isles (MUC-1), Mixed Use Community - Islandside (MUC-2), and Mixed Use Community - Promenade/Water Club (MUC-3). MUC districts allow a mix of residential and nonresidential uses in planned communities developed through the planned unit development procedures and standards contained in sections 158.065 through 158.071. Notwithstanding the terms of any other section of this Zoning Code related to the calculation of density for residential or tourism uses, density in each MUC district cannot exceed the overall density of tourism and dwelling units per acre established by section 158.008 and cannot exceed any further limitations on the overall density that may be established by the town commission for an MUC district during the planned unit development process. When computing overall density in an MUC district, all property is counted, including recreational areas, open space areas, road rights-of-way, wetland areas and other nonresidential lands. An updated land intensity schedule shall be approved with each amendment to a MUC district. Clustered development patterns are encouraged to maximize shared open spaces, thus a specific parcel or parcels within a given MUC district may be more dense than the overall density of the MUC district. 
    The approval of units on any parcel beyond the 892 units in MUC-2 and 1,267 units in MUC-1 authorized by resolution or ordinance prior to January 1, 2014, can be requested through the ODP/PUD process. Approval of additional units is not guaranteed, and in no case may the number of additional units cause the overall density for the entire MUC district to be exceeded. 
    No boundary of any existing MUC district may be expanded to include additional land. 
    The town shall not use the ODP/PUD process to approve new tourism units in the MUC-2 zoning district without voter approval, unless voter approval is prohibited by applicable Florida law. 
    A minimum of 50 percent of the total property within each MUC district shall be maintained in open space. Acreage for recreational uses is not limited. Any changes to existing land-use patterns require approval through the ODP/PUD process and shall be in accordance with the schedule of uses in section 158.125 and shall meet the approval standards in subsection 158.067(C). The general mix of uses within the boundaries of each MUC district, as calculated prior to the application of the 50 percent open space requirement, is allocated as follows: 
(1)  Mixed Use Community - Bay Isles (MUC-1). This district encompasses the Bay Isles community approved by Resolution 75-27 as it has been and may be amended from time to time. Overall density within the boundaries of the MUC-1 district shall not exceed 3.26 dwelling units per acre. 
Use Maximum Percent of Total
Property Within MUC-1 Residential 37% Tourism (units and associated resort/tourism uses) 0% Commercial/Office 4% Institutional 2.5%  
(2)  Mixed Use Community - Islandside (MUC-2). This district encompasses the Islandside community approved by Resolution 76-7 as it has been and may be amended from time to time. Overall density within the boundaries of the MUC-2 district shall not exceed 5.05 units per acre, including tourism units. 
Use Maximum Percent of Total
Property Within MUC-2 Residential 33% Tourism (units and associated resort/tourism uses) 12% Commercial/Office 1.5% Institutional 0%  
(3)  Mixed Use Community - Promenade/Water Club (MUC-3). This district encompasses the Promenade/Water Club communities approved by Resolution 81-8, as it has been and may be amended from time to time. Overall density within the boundaries of the MUC-3 district shall not exceed 11.26 dwelling units per acre. 
Use Maximum Percent of Total
Property Within MUC-3 Residential 100% Tourism 0% Commercial/Office 0% Institutional 0%  
(M)  Office-Institutional District (OI)-Established for mixed land uses to accommodate development of offices, and institutional uses, including, but not limited to, banks and financial institutions. This district is intended to provide additional land development options for office and institutional land uses. Due to their generally close proximity to residential uses, these facilities shall provide a solid masonry fence and/or a berm with landscaping in order to reduce adverse impacts on adjacent residential development. The design including the material, height and screening characteristics shall satisfy sign requirements of chapter 156 and this Zoning Code. 
(N)  Limited Commercial District (C-1)-Established for commercial sites accessible to major thoroughfares near residential neighborhoods. Such development is intended to provide essential tourist or household services in locations highly accessible to residential areas. For instance, sites within this district are intended to accommodate neighborhood shops with limited inventory or goods as well as selected resort commercial uses. Such shops generally cater to the following markets: 1) neighborhood residential markets within the immediate vicinity as opposed to town-wide or regional markets; 2) a specialized market with customized market demands; or 3) a tourist- or resort-oriented market in the immediate vicinity. 
    Commercial development within this district shall generally be restricted to any uses which are permitted in the office-institutional (OI) designated areas as well as the following uses: Neighborhood convenience stores; small limited item shops and stores restricted to retail sales of convenience items and services including, barber, beauty care, and other personal services; small-scale drugstores, laundry and dry cleaning pickup stations; florist shops and other specialty shops; and small-scale tourist-oriented activities associated with safeguarding the stability and integrity of adjacent residential areas. 
    Areas designated for limited commercial development are not intended to accommodate large-scale retail sales, service and market. Such stores would usually differ from limited commercial shops since the former would usually require a large floor area, carry a relatively larger inventory and require a substantially greater parking area. Uses which are not permitted within the limited commercial district include, but are not limited to the following: Large-scale discount stores; health spas; supermarkets; department stores; wholesale and warehousing activities; general appliance shops; printing shops; sales, service or repair of motor vehicles; machine equipment or accessory parts, including tire and battery shops, gas and automotive service centers; commercial amusements; lawn and garden centers and plant nurseries; fast-food establishments primarily serving in disposable containers and/or providing drive-in facilities; and other similar services to be expressly defined in the zoning regulations of this chapter. 
(O)  General Commercial District (C-2)-Established for purposes of accommodating general retail sales and services, including lawn and garden centers. 
    These areas are located in highly accessible areas adjacent to major or minor arterials which possess necessary location and market requirements. Zoning policy shall stipulate provisions for distributing various levels of shopping facilities. 
    Uses which are not permitted within the general commercial district include, but are not limited to the following: Heavy vehicular sales, services or maintenance activities; wholesaling; warehousing; uses requiring extensive outside storage; plant nurseries; or other activities or trades which may generate nuisance impacts, including glare, smoke or other air pollutants, noise vibration or major fire hazards. 
    The areas designated for general commercial development are specifically not adaptive to permanent residential housing, and such residential uses shall be located in other areas designated for residential development. 
(P)  Highway-Oriented Commercial District (C-3)-Established for strategically located sites adjacent to major arterials having sufficient size, including frontage and depth, to accommodate not only the intended use but also sufficient area for implementing an efficient system of internal vehicular circulation, including consideration of space required for queuing of vehicles on-site, off-street parking and maneuvering, landscaping, screening and buffering from abutting residential development or less intensive commercial use, and efficient location and design of curb cuts. 
    Highway-oriented commercial uses include vehicular service stations limited to minor fuel sales, service, and minor repair which shall exclude body repair and finishings; hotel, [motel and restaurant accommodations; lawn and garden centers, but] not plant nurseries; and other retail sales and services oriented to the motoring public or transient resident. Lands designated for highway-oriented commercial services should not be located adjacent to residential development. 
(Q)  Marine Commercial Service District (M-1)-Established for the allocation of land resources for existing and anticipated future commercial service such as marine repair and services, employee services, storage and commercial support services. 
    Marine and commercial service areas are not adaptive to residential use. Therefore, residential uses shall not be located in these districts. This provision shall not prohibit residences for night watchmen or custodians whose presence on such sites is necessary for security purposes. Such a use may be permitted as an accessory use through appropriate zoning procedures. 
    Industry requiring a broad-based labor market, convenient access to a regional transportation system, relatively high demand for water and wastewater services, and other uniquely characteristic needs of industry, shall not be located within the barrier islands of the Town of Longboat Key. Such activities conflict with goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan for Longboat Key and are generally inconsistent with sound planning principles and practices for managing development, redevelopment and resource conservation activities on the narrow, environmentally fragile barrier islands with substantially limited access to industrial labor, resource and product markets. 
(R)  Low-Medium-Density Tourist Resort Commercial District (T-3) and High-Density Tourist Resort Commercial District (T-6)-Established to accommodate the unique land needs for resort-oriented facilities. These facilities generally are marketed as vacation accommodations for tourists and other transients seeking an environment with a high level of amenities. The low-medium-density tourist resort commercial district and the high-density tourist resort commercial district are allocated to sites which shall accommodate densities not to exceed three tourist units per acre and six tourist units per acre respectively. Regulations shall be provided to minimize adverse impact on the transportation system, realizing that trip generation for transient residential facilities is generally higher than year-round accommodations. Similarly, the regulations shall provide for recreation and open space amenities on site, consistent with the purpose and intent of these districts. All commercially provided recreational activities requiring shoreline or near shore water utilization shall be concentrated at the commercial hotel facilities.

158.017 - Parks and open space land acquisition. 
(A)  For the purpose of this section the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning: 
(1)  "Developer." Any person, partnership, corporation, or trustee undertaking any development as defined in this section. 
(2)  "Development." Any subdivision, whether or not the recording of a plat is required; any land on which a multiple-family dwelling unit, residential building, or grouping of the buildings or villas is to be built, including, but not limited to, rental cooperative or condominium units and including land to be used for commercial condominiums, tourism uses, or individual dwellings, the latter including the construction of a single-family lot or lots. 
(B)  This section is enacted to ensure that future land development within the town preserves or provides land in its natural state for parks and open space in accordance with the policies as set forth in the Longboat Key Comprehensive Plan. Developers and landowners, including builders of residences on single-family lots, must provide for parks and open space. The scope of this section is further to set forth certain regulations pertaining to land development and construction within the town, providing for parks and open space, which regulations shall be in addition to all other applicable building, subdivision, zoning and other regulations established by the town ordinances. This section shall apply to and be enforced in all areas of the town; and no persons shall develop land, nor construct any single-family residence, anywhere in the town except in conformity with this section and other applicable regulations of the Code of Ordinances and amendments thereto. 
(C)  The town will use the following as criteria to guide open space land acquisition: 
(1)  Implementation of the policies that minimize risk seaward of the Coastal Construction Control Line; 
(2)  Continuing to preserve natural landscape, native vegetation and significant wildlife species and their habitats as adopted in the Zoning Code; 
(3)  Consideration of the inventory of existing parks and open space property; 
(4)  Located adjacent to existing publicly-owned or controlled lands; 
(5)  The provisions of the reserve account in trust as established pursuant to town ordinances; and 
(6)  Properties that serve the public interest. 
(D)  As a condition precedent to the grant of any permits following approval of final development plans, site plans, subdivision plats, or issuance of a building permit, the developer shall deed land to the town, pay a money fee in lieu thereof, or provide a combination of the above, at the option of the town commission, to be used for parks and open space specified in this section and according to the standards and formula set forth in this section. 
(1)  General standard; formula. 
(a)  It is hereby found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that 12 acres of land or equivalent money value be deeded or paid to the town for each potential 1,000 persons residing in the town to be devoted for the park and open space purposes of this section as implemented by subsection (b) below. 
(b)  In order to achieve the open space goals of the Town of Longboat Key for its projected maximum population, in recognition of the current inventory of open space lands held by the town, and to require a developer to pay an amount roughly proportional to the demand the development places upon open space within the town; five acres of land or equivalent money value will be deeded or paid to the town for each potential 1,000 persons residing in the town to be devoted for parks and open space purposes of this section. 
(c)  To determine the amount of land for parks and open space to be conveyed in accordance with the general standard, the following shall be used: 
    Average number of persons per dwelling or tourism unit divided by 1,000 population, multiplied by acres of land required, equals acreage requirement per dwelling or tourism unit. Example: For single dwelling or tourism unit: 2.01 divided by 1,000 × 5 = .010 per dwelling or tourism unit. 
(d)  The following basis is to be followed in determining the amount of land to be included: 
Unit Type Acreage 
Requirement/D.U. or T.U. Single-Family .01 Duplex .01 Multifamily .01 Tourism .01  
(e)  For land zoned for multifamily or tourism uses, the land dedication basis shall be applied to the number of dwelling and tourism units included in the final development plan. 
(f)  The land to be conveyed to the town may be located either within or outside of the boundaries of the property proposed for development. 
(2)  Formula for fees in lieu of land conveyance. 
(a)  If it is determined that the proposed development does not include any land that can be used as open space, to serve the immediate and future needs of the town residents, and the developer is unwilling or unable to deed to the town lands outside the proposed development that are so designated, then the developer shall, in lieu of conveying land, pay a fee to the town equal to the value of the land acreage that would otherwise have been required to be conveyed as determined by the formula herein, and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions set out below, the fee to be used by the town for acquisition of land and parks and open space which is intended to exclusively serve the residents of the town. 
(b)  The provisions of this subsection shall automatically apply to all developments of 25 dwelling or tourism units or less. 
(E)  In any development of over 25 dwelling or tourism units, the developer may be required to convey land and pay a fee in accordance with the following formula: 
(1)  When only a portion of the land which the developer is required to convey for parks and open space is to be conveyed, that portion shall be conveyed for parks or local open space and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions set out herein shall be paid to the town for any additional land that the developer would otherwise have been required to convey hereunder. 
(2)  When most of the land designated as parks and open space in the vicinity of the proposed development has already been acquired by the town and only a small remaining portion of the land in the proposed development is needed to complete the site, that remaining portion shall be conveyed by the developer and a fee shall be paid by the developer in lieu of conveying the additional land which would otherwise have been required to be conveyed. The fees shall be in an amount equal to the value of the additional land which the developer would otherwise be required to convey, and the fees shall be used for the improvement of other town parks and open space land in the area serving the development. 
(F)  If the developer objects to the fair market value determination, he may submit an appraisal from a state certified appraiser showing the fair market value of the lands required to be donated; and final determination of the market value per acre of the land shall be made by the town commission based upon such information submitted by the developer. Should the developer's state certified appraisal not be acceptable to the town, the town shall appoint another state certified appraiser. The town's state certified appraiser and the developer's state certified appraiser shall select a third state certified appraiser; and the fair market value of the lands required to be conveyed, as determined by the three appraisers, shall be binding upon the developer and the town. The cost of an appraisal shall be a credit against any fees. 
(G)  The town commission shall determine whether to accept land or require payment of the fee in lieu thereof, after consideration of the following: 
(1)  Topography, geology, access and location of land in the development available for dedication. 
(2)  Size and shape of the development and land available. 
(3)  The feasibility of conveyance. 
(4)  Availability of previously acquired parks and open space property. 
(H)  Where private or public open space is provided in a proposed or existing planned unit development or district in excess of the then requirement of section 158.069, or any amendment thereof, of the Zoning Code, partial credit, not to exceed 50 percent of the amount of land required to be conveyed, may be given against the requirements of land to be conveyed or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the town commission finds it is in the required zoning and building ordinances. 
(I)  In the case of a subdivision for which a plat is required to be recorded, as a condition of preliminary plat approval, the developer shall agree in writing to convey land for parks and open space, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the town commission at the time and according to the standards and formula in this section after a recommendation from the town manager, or designee and approved by the town commission at the time of approval of the subdivision preliminary plat. At the time of approval of the final subdivision plat, the developer shall convey the land and pay the fees as previously determined by the town commission, but not later than issuance of a building permit. 
(J)  The fees collected under this section shall be paid to the town at Town Hall, 501 Bay Isles Road, Longboat Key, Florida. All such fees, including any fees collected pursuant to Ordinances 79-7, 80-1, 80-9 and 81-27, shall be placed in a reserve account in trust within the general fund and shall be known as the reserve for lands for parks land open space. Monies in the reserve account shall be used and expended solely for the acquisition, improvement and expansion of town parks and open space land.

(Ord. 90-06, passed 3-19-90) 
158.026 - Zoning board of adjustment. 
(A)  (1)  There is hereby established a zoning board of adjustment, hereinafter referred to as a board of adjustment. The board of adjustment shall consist of five members who are registered voters and residents of the Town of Longboat Key who shall be appointed by the town commission. All members must attend a Sunshine and Public Records Law class within three months of their appointment. The board shall elect a chairman annually from among its members. No member of the board of adjustment shall be an elected official or employee of the town. A person appointed to this board may not serve concurrently on any of the following town boards: Code enforcement board, planning and zoning board or retirement system board of trustees. 
(2)  The term of office shall be for three years and shall be staggered so that not more than three terms expire within any one year. All terms of office shall expire on the second Wednesday of May of the year in which the term is set to expire. Any member who fails to attend three consecutive scheduled and called regular meetings or fails to make themselves available to attend three proposed meetings within a 12-month period shall automatically forfeit his appointment and the town commission shall promptly fill the vacancy. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be for the unexpired term of month period the member whose term becomes vacant. 
(3), (4)  [Repealed by Amd. Ord. of 93-11, passed 7-6-93] 
(B)  The board of adjustment shall establish rules and regulations for its own operation not inconsistent with the provisions of applicable state statutes or of this chapter. 
(C)  The board of adjustment shall elect a chairman, a vice chairman, and a secretary from among its members. The chairman shall be the presiding member of the board, and the vice chairman shall be the presiding member in the chairman's absence or disqualification. The board of adjustment may elect other officers as they deem necessary. The terms of all officers shall be for one year, with eligibility for reelection. 
(D)  The board of adjustment shall meet at the call of the chairman, at the written request of three or more regular members, or within 30 days after receipt of a matter to be acted upon by the board. Three members of the board shall constitute a quorum. All meetings of the board of adjustment shall be public. A record of all its resolutions, transactions, findings and determinations shall be made, which shall be a public record on file in the office of the town clerk. 
(E)  The concurring vote of a majority of members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the planning and zoning official or to decide in favor of the appellant in respect to any matter on which it is required to pass under the terms of this chapter or to effect any variations of this chapter. Should a petition to the board of adjustment receive a vote of less than a majority of members, but affirmative votes of enough when added to the absent members to make a majority, the petition shall be rescheduled from meeting to meeting until the matter can be decided by a concurring vote of a majority of members of the board. 
(F)  The board of adjustment shall have the following powers and duties: 
(1)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter. 
(2)  To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this chapter on which the board is required to pass as required in this section. 
(3)  To hear and decide waivers from the daylight plane regulations of this Code pursuant to the procedures established for appeals as set forth in F.S. § 158.027. In determining whether to grant a waiver, the zoning board of adjustment shall review the waiver application including both site and schematic design drawings and shall consider: (a) impacts to view of neighbors and neighborhood; (b) uniqueness of the configuration of the lot upon which the structure is proposed; and (c) special circumstances or conditions affecting the property, such that the strict application of the daylight plane requirements would inordinately burden the property owner and would deprive the property owner of a reasonable design for the building as it relates to its environs. If the zoning board of adjustment determines that a waiver is appropriate it may increase the angle for the daylight plane, with or without conditions. Such waiver, if approved, shall apply to the building only and shall not terminate upon the destruction of the building. 
(4)  To authorize upon appeal in specific cases and where not otherwise prohibited by the terms of this chapter a variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary and undue hardship. As used in this chapter a variance can be authorized only for height, area and size of structure or size of yards and open spaces; but in no event may a variance be granted by the board of adjustment that would allow an increase in density. 
(5)  The board of adjustment shall not consider any matter when in the opinion of the board, after consideration of the recommendation of the town attorney, the matter presented is not within the jurisdiction of the board as set forth in this chapter.

(A)  An appeal to the board of adjustment stays all work on the premises and all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed for unless the official from whom the appeal was taken shall certify to the board of adjustment, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In this case, proceedings or work shall not be stayed except by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or a court of record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown. 
(B)  Any person appealing any decision of an administrative official shall make the appeal within 30 days after rendition of the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from in writing to the board of adjustment and file with the planning and zoning official the appeal, an application fee as set by resolution of the town commission, and a sufficient number of copies of supporting facts and data to satisfy administrative needs as determined by the town manager, or designee.

(C)  Upon receipt of the appeal, the planning and zoning official shall forthwith examine the appeal or request application and endorse his weighted options thereon together with all documents, plans, papers, or other materials constituting the record on which the action appealed was taken and transmit it to the board of adjustment. Concurrently, the planning and zoning official shall transmit a copy of the appeal together with all documents, plans, papers, or other materials constituting the record to the town attorney for his review and opinion. The town attorney shall present his opinion to the board of adjustment with respect to two items, as to whether the appeal is in fact an appeal and within the jurisdiction of the board of adjustment, and the merits of the appeal proper if requested by the board. Based on past opinions of the town attorney, the town manager, or designee may make such determinations. 
(D)  Before rendering a decision on an appeal, the board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing. The board shall fix a reasonable time of day for the hearing and cause public notice to be given at the petitioner's expense. Notice of public hearings of the board shall, at least seven days prior to hearing, be:

The guide for the mailing requirement to owners shall be the most current town or county assessment roll. 
(F)  At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent or by attorney. With respect to condominiums or cooperatives, notice required by this section will be deemed notice to its property owners when notice is sent or delivered to the secretary and the president of the condominium or cooperative association, unless the offices are not filled, in which event notice to the agent designated for the service of process will be sufficient compliance with the notice requirements of this section. However, in the discretion of the zoning board of adjustment, notice may be required to be given to each condominium owner or cooperative unit owner.

(B)  In granting any special exception, the planning and zoning board and the board of adjustment shall find that the grant will not adversely affect the public interest. The decision shall be reached only after the holding of a public hearing conducted in the manner set forth in subsection 158.027(D). 
(C)  In granting any special exception, the planning and zoning board and the board of adjustment in addition to the standards enumerated in section 158.126, may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Violation of the conditions and safeguards when made a part of the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.

158.029 - Variances. 
(A)  Upon receipt of a complete application and application fee as set by resolution of the town commission the board of adjustment may authorize upon appeal a variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest and as set forth in subsection 158.026(F), where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary and undue hardship. In order to authorize any variance from the terms of this chapter, the board of adjustment must and shall find the following: 
(1)  The variance is in fact a variance as set forth within this chapter and within the jurisdiction of the board after consideration of the recommendation of the town attorney. 
(2)  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district. 
(3)  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
(4)  Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district. 
(5)  Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of this chapter and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
(6)  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
(7)  The grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter, and the variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(B)  An applicant for a variance shall have the burden of establishing both that a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, as that term is defined by law, including court decisions; and that allowance of the variance shall not be contrary to the public interest. 
(C)  In granting any variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violation of the conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The board of adjustment may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be begun or completed or both. Under no circumstances, except as permitted above, shall the board of adjustment grant a variance to permit a use not generally or by special exception permitted in the zoning district involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in the zoning district. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other zoning districts shall be considered grounds for the authorization of a variance. 
(D)  In granting any variance, the board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing as set forth in subsections 158.027(D) and (E), and shall make specific findings of fact which establish that a literal enforcement of this Zoning Code will result in unnecessary and undue hardship. The board of adjustment shall also make specific findings of fact that each of the criteria set forth in subsection (A) of this section have been met. The findings of fact as required by this subsection shall be incorporated in the minutes of the meeting.

(1)  On its own motion. 
(2)  On petition from the owners of 51 percent or more of the area involved in the proposed change. 
(3)  On recommendation of the planning and zoning board. 
(B)  The planning and zoning board, regardless of the source of the proposed change, shall hold a public hearing thereon, with due public notice, but shall in any case if any change is to be considered by the planning and zoning board, submit in writing its recommendation on the proposed change to the governing body for official action. The town commission shall then proceed to amend, supplement, repeal, or leave unchanged the regulations in accordance with applicable provisions of the Charter and this Code. If the recommendation of the planning and zoning board is adverse to the proposed change, such change shall not become effective except by an affirmative vote of four members of the town commission, after due public notice. 
(C)  Whenever the fee simple owner of any property desires a change in zoning classification, a change of the conditions or regulations of any district or any other provision of this chapter, he shall make written application to the planning and zoning official on a form as provided by the town staff together with full payment of an application fee as set forth by resolution of the town commission the written application to be signed by the owner or his agent. The application shall be accompanied by any necessary information or documentation supporting the request and shall be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the Charter.

158.032 - Vested rights determination. 
    If any person is in doubt whether rights have vested for a proposed development on property owned by that person, based on the granting of any development order by the town or any of its commissions, agencies or departments, the property owner may request a determination from the town commission. For the purposes of this provision the term "vested rights" shall be interpreted to include those rights obtained by a property owner who: 1) in good faith; 2) upon some act or omission of the government; 3) has made such a substantial change in position by incurring such extensive obligations and expenses that it would be highly inequitable and unjust to destroy the acquired right. In making its determination the town commission shall hold a public hearing after full payment of an application fee as set forth by resolution of the town commission and required public notice and assess each request for a vested rights interpretation on the particular facts relating to that case. Notwithstanding anything in this provision to the contrary, if the Town of Longboat Key shows that a new peril to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the residents or property in the Town of Longboat Key has arisen subsequent to the approval of any development order, the development order may be revoked.

Article III. - Site and Development Plans 
Division 1. - Planned Unit Developments (PUD) 

158.065 - Overview of planned unit developments (PUD). 
(A)  Intent. Planned unit developments are intended: to encourage flexibility in the design and development of land; facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets, utilities, and public spaces; and preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open areas. The PUD application, review and approval procedure is intended to permit diversification in the location of structures and improve circulation facilities and other site qualities while ensuring adequate standards relating to public health, safety, comfort, order, appearance, convenience, morals and general welfare. 
    Planned unit development (PUD) regulations provide an optional review and approval process for applicants who seek to develop or redevelop parcels and are limited to parcels that are: 1) located in Mixed Use Community (MUC) zoning districts; or 2) conforming for density, if developed with residential or tourism uses and not zoned R-1IP, R-1SF, R-2SF, R-3SF, R-4SF, or R-6SF; or 3) zoned INS, OI, C-1, C-2, C-3 or M-1. 
    In the MUC zoning districts, the PUD process establishes development rights on specific parcels, thus the PUD process is the only process that landowners in those zoning districts can use to request changes to the development plans for those parcels. 
    The PUD process allows approval of a conceptual site plan, known as a binding concept plan, prior to preparation and submission of a final site development plan. The PUD process also allows landowners to seek departures from certain provisions of this Code at the conceptual design stage. Landowners must conform to the approved binding concept plan when they submit final site development plans in accordance with subsection 158.067(F). 
(B)  Effect on zoning district. The PUD process requires the submission of an outline development plan (ODP), which becomes an integral part of a PUD approval. Planned unit development approval does not change the underlying zoning district, nor does it add permitted uses to those specified for each zoning district in the table accompanying section 158.125, the schedule of use regulations. 
(C)  Where permissible. PUD approval shall be limited to any of the following zoning district(s), provided that parcels developed with residential or tourism uses are conforming for density, are not already zoned CORD, and the minimum area requirements in section 158.068 are met for the following zoning districts: 
(1)  INS; 
(2)  R-3MX, R-4MX, and R-6MX; 
(3)  MUC-1, MUC-2, and MUC-3; 
(4)  OI, C-1, C-2, C-3, and M-1; and 
(5)  T-3 and T-6. 
(D)  Density. Planned unit developments (PUD) approvals are limited to parcels that are developed with conforming density for residential or tourism uses and shall comply with the special density provisions found in section 158.070. 
(E)  Site plans. A PUD is approved through the adoption of an outline development plan (ODP). Binding concept plans are required as part of outline development plans, except where this Code explicitly allows a final site development plan to replace a binding concept plan (see, for instance, subsections 158.067(B)(1) and 158.180(F)). Binding concept plans become an integral part of ODP and PUD approvals. Binding concept plans (and final site development plans) may be subsequently amended in accordance with the standards and procedures in section 158.067. 
(Ord. 90-06, passed 3-19-90; Ord. 2012-08, § 5, passed 7-2-12; Ord. 2013-20, § 9, passed 6-30-14; Ord. 2018-14, § 2, passed 2-4-19) 
158.066 - Preapplication conference. 
    In order to expedite the review of a proposed planned unit development, coordinate its local review in respect to the provisions of this chapter with the necessary county, state, and federal agency reviews, and to inform the town of a planned unit development in preparation, one or more preapplication conferences between the applicant and the planning and zoning official is required. The preapplication conference, while informal, will serve several purposes and focus on the following items: 
(A)  To inform the town of any planned unit development plans in progress together with the scale and character of the plan so that the town may recognize the proposed development in any of its physical or facility planning for the entire town. 
(B)  To inform the applicant of the town's informal response as to the scale and character of the proposed development and to alert the applicant to any specific areas of concern that the town may have for that specific site or proposed plan. 
(C)  To clarify and inform the applicant in respect to the outline development plan approval procedure and submission requirements, including an anticipated application time and review period as specifically set forth in section 158.067. 
(D)  To enable the applicant to inform the town of the requirements, procedure, and status of the various county, state and federal agency reviews. 
(Ord. 90-06, passed 3-19-90; Ord. 2012-08, § 6, passed 7-2-12) 
158.067 - Review and approval of planned unit developments. 
(A)  Approving authority. Planned unit developments are subject to the approval of the town commission after review and recommendation by the planning and zoning board and after public hearings are held by the town commission in accordance with law. 
(B)  Applications. In order to provide an expeditious method for processing an outline development plan application for a planned unit development, under the terms of this chapter, it is hereby declared to be in the public interest that all procedures with respect to the review, approval or disapproval of a plan for a planned unit development, and the continuing administration thereof, shall be consistent with the following provisions: 
(1)  Application requirements. An application for an outline development plan for a planned unit development, including full payment of an application fee as set forth by resolution of the town commission, shall be filed and signed by or on behalf of the landowner by an authorized agent, with the planning and zoning official. The purpose of the outline development plan is to provide the town with information with respect to the type, character, scale, and intensity of development as well as the time phasing of the proposed planned unit development in order for the town to evaluate the impact of the development to the town. Any application for outline development approval shall be submitted on a form provided by the town and in addition shall include at a minimum the following information, unless the planning and zoning official determines in writing that one or more of the following elements do not apply to the particular application: 
(a)  A scaled drawing delineating the relationship of the site to existing development in the area, including streets, utilities, residential and commercial development, and important physical features in and adjoining the project, including ecological features. 
(b)  A scaled drawing delineating the approximate location and dimensions of all boundary lines of the development, and of any contiguous lands, including those separated only by a street, canal or similar feature, in which the developer or property owner presently has any legal interest. 
(c)  A verified statement, including a certificate of ownership, showing each and every individual person having a legal ownership interest in the subject property except publicly held corporations whose stock is traded on a nationally recognized stock exchange, in which case the name and address of the corporation and principal executive officers will be sufficient. 
(d)  A scaled drawing delineating the approximate location, nature and extent of all existing easements, streets, buildings, land uses, zoning, tree groupings, watercourses, uplands, wetlands, and topographic contours (i.e., at six-inch intervals with reference to mean sea level), on the site; the existing zoning and land use for all contiguous property; and flood protection elevation data and flood zones. 
(e)  Tabulations by acreage and percentage as to the amount of the site that is uplands and wetlands, indicating those wetlands landward and seaward of the mean high-water line (MHWL), including the extent and type of wetlands in accordance with the town's comprehensive plan. 
(f)  A scaled drawing delineating the approximate locations, intensity and acreages of general land uses (proposed), including dwelling types and units and general types of nonresidential uses, open spaces, recreational facilities and other proposed uses. 
(g)  A traffic impact analysis shall be provided, except for voluntary reconstruction without additional dwelling or tourism units, to ensure that the adopted level of service standards are not exceeded before capacity-related improvements are implemented; and a scaled drawing delineating a circulation facilities plan indicating approximate locations and types of proposed streets, bicycle paths, pedestrian walks, and emergency vehicle access points, including all curb cuts, driveways, off-street parking and loading areas and off-street surfaces available for maneuvering vehicles. 
(h)  Tabulations of total project acreage and proposed densities for each tourism and dwelling unit type and total number of tourism and dwelling units by type. 
(i)  Tabulations demonstrating compliance with the floor area ratio provisions of subsection 158.102(C), including floor area ratios for all land uses and approximate square footage of gross area for all nonresidential buildings by general type (e.g., offices, limited commercial, etc.). 
(j)  A proposed development schedule indicating approximate starting and completion dates for the entire project and any phases thereof, together with appropriate identification and description of such phases. 
(k)  Such additional data and information as the applicant may believe is pertinent to the plan of development. 
(l)  Such additional relevant data and information the town may reasonably require. 
(m)  A written statement by the landowner or any other entity having a cognizable interest in the land, describing fully the character and intended use of the planned unit development and setting forth the reasons why, in his opinion, a planned unit development would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the town's statement of purposes of a planned unit development. 
(n)  A statement specifically indicating any requested departures from article IV of this chapter and section 158.102, and a statement of any existing hardship and/or clear and specific statement of how the code departures are necessary or desirable to accomplish a planned unit development under sections 158.065 through 158.071. The statement shall include the applicant's position as to why each requested departure either meets or has no material adverse effect on each of the departure criteria in subsection 158.067(D). 
(o)  A binding concept plan, which is a conceptual site plan that depicts the proposed development and is intended to become an integral part of a planned unit development approval. The binding concept plan shall show the existing and proposed uses and structures, lots, streets, and other physical aspects of the proposed development as enumerated in sections 158.067 and 158.102. At an applicant's discretion, a final site plan may be submitted for approval concurrently with the outline development plan, thus eliminating this requirement for a binding concept plan. 
(p)  Additional requirements for applications for voluntary reconstruction of nonconformities: 
1.  A statement specifically indicating modifications and adjustments from the requirements of this Code of Ordinances which would otherwise be applicable to the project if voluntary reconstruction were not granted by the town. 
2.  A clear and specific statement of any hardship that exists making the modifications and adjustments from the Code necessary. 
3.  A clear and specific statement of how the modifications and adjustments are necessary or desirable to accomplish one or more of the stated purposes of the voluntary reconstruction provisions in section 158.140. 
(2)  Application procedures. The application for an outline development plan of a planned unit development shall be filed with the planning and zoning official. As an alternative to submitting a binding concept plan, the applicant may concurrently file an application for site plan approval. If filed, the application for site plan approval shall be processed in accordance with article III, division 2, herein. Upon receipt of the application the planning and zoning official shall review the application to determine its appropriateness and completeness and accept or reject it in writing. Upon acceptance of the application, the town's administrative staff shall refer the application, together with all supporting documentation and a staff report, to the planning and zoning board for its review and recommendations. The planning and zoning board and town commission shall not receive, review, make recommendations or act on applications for outline development plan approval except during the town's annual site and development plan season. During the review process, the town may retain consultants to assist in the review. The cost of retaining the consultants shall be borne by the applicant. For purposes of this chapter, the annual site and development plan season shall include the months of September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April, May and June of each year. For purposes of calculating the required processing times set forth in this section for the planning and zoning board and the town commission, the period of time from July 1 through August 31 shall not be counted in said computation. 
(3)  Planning and zoning board public hearing. Upon receipt of the application from the planning and zoning official, the planning and zoning board shall review the outline development plan and make recommendations to the town commission that are based on competent, substantial evidence of record. The planning and zoning board may also formulate findings of fact as to the consistency of the application with this Code and with the comprehensive plan. The board shall recommend approval of the application as submitted, approval of the application with changes or special conditions, or disapproval of the application. The determination and recommendations of the planning and zoning board shall be advisory only and shall not be binding upon the town commission. For purposes of this section the planning and zoning board shall receive an outline development plan application from the planning and zoning official at the board's next regular meeting where a quorum is present following the planning and zoning official's submittal of the application to the board. The planning and zoning board is specifically authorized to continue its deliberations, reasonably request additional relevant materials, and elicit expert testimony to aid in its deliberations. 
(4)  Town commission public hearing. A public hearing on the planned unit development application shall be held by the town commission upon the commission's receipt of the application from the planning and zoning board, public notice of which shall be given in accordance with the provisions of the Charter and this chapter. For purposes of this section, the town commission shall receive an outline development plan application from the planning and zoning board at the commission's next regular meeting where a quorum is present, following the submittal of the board's action on the application to the commission. A transcript of the hearing may be caused to be made by the town commission at the cost of the applicant, copies of which shall be made available at cost to any party to the proceedings; and all exhibits accepted in evidence shall be identified and duly preserved, or, if not accepted in evidence, shall be properly identified and the reason for the exclusion clearly noted in the record. The town commission is specifically authorized to continue its deliberations, request additional materials and elicit expert testimony to aid in its deliberations, and may, at its sole discretion, remand the application to the planning and zoning board for additional hearing and consideration. If changes are made to the application, accompanying plans or conditions of approval after review by the planning and zoning board, the commission may, at its sole discretion, remand the application back to the board, but is not required to do so. 
(5)  Town commission decision procedures. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the town commission shall review the outline development plan application and either approve it as submitted, approve it with changes or special conditions, or disapprove it. The action taken by the town commission shall be by ordinance. The town commission may unilaterally extend the time for final action where the commission determines additional time is necessary to properly and completely review the outline development plan application. 
(a)  In the event approval is granted, the town commission shall, as part of its ordinance, specify the drawings, plan sheets, renderings, specifications, and form of performance and maintenance bonds that shall be considered part of the final approval. 
(b)  In the event approval is granted subject to changes or special conditions, the applicant shall, within 30 calendar days after receiving a copy of the ordinance of the town commission, notify the town commission in writing of the applicant's acceptance or refusal of all the conditions. In the event the applicant refuses to accept all the conditions or fails to reply within 30 calendar days, the applicant shall be deemed to have withdrawn the plan. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the town commission and the applicant from mutually agreeing to a change in the conditions, or an extension of the time during which the applicant shall notify the town commission of acceptance or refusal of the conditions. 
(c)  In the event an outline development plan is granted approval, the town commission shall set forth in the ordinance the time within which an application for final site plan approval, or applications in the case of a phased development, shall be filed. However, if a final site plan was approved concurrently with the outline development plan, the ordinance does not need to specify a time period. 
(C)  Standards for approval or disapproval of application. The town commission shall base its decision on each outline development plan application on competent, substantial evidence of record and shall include conclusions but may also include written findings of fact related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons for the grant of approval, with or without changes or special conditions, or for the disapproval of an outline development plan application. The commission's approval, approval with changes or special conditions, or disapproval of an outline development plan application, shall be based on the application, evidence and testimony presented in the public hearing, and the following standards: 
(1)  In what respects the outline development plan is or is not consistent with the intent of a planned unit development as provided in section 158.065. 
(2)  Whether the plan is consistent with the town's comprehensive plan. 
(3)  The extent to which the plan meets the zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property without departures, waivers, or variances. 
(4)  The purpose, location and amount of common open space in the plan, the adequacy or inadequacy of the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the common open space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the common open space as related to the proposed density and type of development. 
(5)  The physical design of the plan and the manner in which the design makes adequate provision for public services, provides adequate control over vehicular traffic and parking, and enhances the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment. 
(6)  The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed plan to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established. 
(7)  In the case of a plan that proposes development over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to protect the public interest and of the residents and owners of the planned unit development in the faithful completion of the plan. 
(8)  The extent to which the plan provides for an effective and unified development on the project site making appropriate provision for the preservation of scenic features and amenities of the site and the surrounding areas. 
(9)  For the MUC-1 and MUC-2 zoning districts only, all permitted uses as listed in section 158.145 for each district are considered generally to be compatible uses in the MUC districts based on the intent to encourage mixed use and clustering at varying scales and intensity. Compatibility shall be achieved at specific locations by implementing compatibility techniques, such as those listed in this section as appropriate to the context: 
(a)  Tourism uses and restaurants shall be designed to minimize noise from outdoor activities, such as outdoor music; 
(b)  Loading areas and parking at grade shall be screened and landscaped to minimize impacts to residential uses and adjacent rights-of-way/private roads; 
(c)  Anti-glare glass shall be utilized in all windows that could potentially reflect toward another residential use; and 
(d)  Lighting shall be designed to minimize impacts to residential units and adjacent public rights-of-way/private roads. 
(e)  Additional compatibility techniques shall be employed wherever a proposed structure exceeding four stories is located within 500 feet of another structure that is substantially lower in height. "Substantially lower" means there is a difference of four stories or more between the proposed structure and the structure within 500 feet. For the purpose of this provision, acceptable compatibility techniques include, but are not limited to, perimeter berms, landscaping buffers, building orientation, building design and architectural treatments. 
(f)  This section does not apply to the compatibility of uses within a proposed PUD development site, as permitted uses are deemed internally compatible. 
(10)  The additional criteria listed below apply to requests for buildings taller than four stories in the MUC-2 zoning district: 
(a)  Yard sizes (building setbacks) are greater than required by section 158.145; and 
(b)  The taller buildings are consistent with the intent of the district and compatible with similar existing uses within the overall district. 
(D)  Standards for approval or disapproval of departures. Planned unit development applications may be accompanied by requests for departures from specific standards of article IV of this chapter and from the standards of section 158.102, whether the application for final site plan approval is concurrently filed or not. However, departures may not be granted to add uses that are not listed in the schedule of uses in section 158.125 for the zoning district underlying the planned unit development. Before approving a departure, the town commission shall determine by competent, substantial evidence of record that each departure is consistent with the Longboat Key Comprehensive Plan and shall decide whether each departure either meets or has no material adverse effect on the following criteria, except where clearly inapplicable to the requested departure: 
(1)  The departure is no less consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of abutting landowners and the general public than the standard from which the departure is being requested, and the departure adequately protects against adverse impacts to adjacent parcels and the surrounding area. 
(2)  The departure preserves or enhances natural or scenic qualities or preserves a larger percentage of open space than required by the Zoning Code or preserves higher quality natural areas or more attractive and useful public spaces. 
(3)  The departure facilitates desirable infrastructure, stormwater retention, or parking facilities. 
(4)  The departure reduces traffic impacts or improves traffic circulation. 
(5)  The departure enhances the project's character and compatibility within the development and with adjacent developments. 
(6)  The departure allows the project to add or improve on-site amenities and recreational opportunities serving the development and the community. 
(7)  The departure helps the project promote walkability, offers multimodal transportation options, improves access to existing commercial or other amenities, or improves connections to beach or bay accesses. 
(E)  Modified standards for planned unit developments. Lot coverage and building standards in article IV of this Code are modified for planned unit developments as follows: 
(1)  If the plan is for land within the T-3, T-6, MUC-1, MUC-2, INS, OI, C-1, C-2, C-3, or M-1 district, lot coverage may exceed the standard lot coverage provided by section 158.145 by up to ten percent to encourage flexibility in design and development without the requirement for a departure pursuant to subsection (D) above. The density/intensity table in the comprehensive plan authorizes these increases for PUDs only. The increases are reflected in the table accompanying section 158.145 of this Code; further increases are not allowed by the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  If the plan is for property within the T-3, T-6, or MUC-1 district, building height may exceed the standard height provided by section 158.145 by one story at a maximum of 15 feet. If the plan is for property within the MUC-2 district, the height for buildings with tourism units may be a maximum of 12 stories at a maximum of 130 feet, and the height of other uses may be a maximum of eight stories at a maximum of 87 feet, provided the standards in subsection 158.067(C) are met. The density/intensity table in the comprehensive plan authorizes these increases for PUDs only. The increases are reflected in the table accompanying section 158.145 of this Code; increases beyond those heights are not allowed by the comprehensive plan. 
(F)  Actions after decision. Within seven days after the adoption of the ordinance provided for in subsection (D) above, it shall be certified by the town clerk and shall be filed in his office, and a certified copy shall be mailed to the applicant. An outline development plan upon approval and acceptance, as provided herein, is defined as running with the land; however, an applicant may apply for a revision to the outline development plan in accordance with the procedures for an original submission, review and approval. Approval of an outline development plan shall not qualify a plat of the planned unit development for recording purposes or authorize development or the issuance of any building permits. Upon approval and acceptance, if applicable, the town clerk shall file with the clerk of the court the outline development plan to record it in the official records of the county in which the property is located. 
(G)  Final site plan required. An application for final site plan approval may be for all the land included in an outline development plan, or to the extent set forth in the outline development plan approval, for a section thereof. 
(1)  The final site plan application shall include any drawings, plan sheets, renderings, specifications, covenants, easements, conditions, and form of performance and maintenance bonds as were set forth by the town commission in the ordinance approving the outline development plan and required by subsection 157.31(B). 
(2)  The submission, review and approval of an application for final site plan approval shall be subject to the procedures and provisions of a site plan review as set forth within sections 158.095 through 158.103. 
(3)  Planned unit development applications may include a request for final site plan approval at the same time as outline development plan approval; see subsection 158.067(B)(1). 
(4)  An application for approval of a final site plan for a portion of or all of an outline development plan shall be in compliance with the approved outline development plan with respect to open space and lot, yard and bulk regulations. 
(5)  If the final site plan is not in compliance, the applicant shall revise the final site plan, apply for a site plan exemption, or amend the outline development plan through the outline development process provided herein, in order to achieve compliance. 
(H)  Length of approval. 
(1)  Notwithstanding the 24-month period specified in subsection 158.099(F), final site development plan approval for a planned unit development runs with the land for a period not to exceed four calendar years from the date of the ordinance adopting the final site development plan. 
(2)  For planned unit developments in the MUC-1 and MUC-2 zoning districts, this period shall be increased to ten calendar years, or for an approved period longer than ten years for a specific future phase delineated on the final site development plan, provided the developer meets at least two of the following criteria: 
(a)  Commenced site preparation work and maintained substantial progress during the initial four-year period affecting 33 percent or more of the acreage of the PUD development parcel, or if the PUD approval includes phases, affecting 66 percent of the acreage of the initial phase; 
(b)  Commenced site preparation work and completed at least one critical element of the required infrastructure to serve the PUD development parcel; 
(c)  Commenced site preparation work and constructed at least one principal building (not including a temporary building) within the PUD development parcel; or 
(d)  Paid all impact fees for development authorized by the site development plan. 
(3)  The town reserves the right to change or reformat the provisions of this Code and adopted PUD ordinances or resolutions; such changes will not alter any rights granted by unexpired site development plan approvals. 
(I)  Conformance with subdivision regulations. The design, construction, and guarantee of completion and maintenance of all physical improvements-including, but not limited to, streets, drainage, potable water, and sewage collection required by a PUD-shall conform with chapter 157 of this Code and all other applicable ordinances.

In cases of minor development proposals and/or changes, the planning and zoning official may determine a preapplication conference is not necessary. For the purposes outlined above, the developer should provide such information as necessary to describe the proposed development. Formal application or filing of a site plan with the planning and zoning official is not required for the preapplication conference. 
(Ord. 90-06, passed 3-19-90) 
158.099 - Submission procedure. 
(A)  An application for a site plan review shall be made to the planning and zoning official prior to an application for a building permit, and the application for a site plan review will only be approved if all other ordinances and provisions of the town where a public hearing is required have been complied with and a pre-application conference has been conducted in accordance with section 158.098. For development requiring subdivision approval under chapter 157 of this Code, final subdivision plat approval must be obtained prior to site plan approval. 
(1)  All required county, regional, state or federal agency approvals shall be obtained prior to submission of an application for site plan review except as set forth in subsection (2) below or as otherwise required by law or administrative procedures. 
(2)  At the applicant's request, the processing of required county, regional, state and federal permit applications may proceed coincidentally with the processing of final site plan review subject to the following conditions: 
(a)  The applicant shall immediately provide the town with copies of all applications for permits and supporting documentation, correspondence and any other material submitted to any outside permitting agencies or received from such agencies and the town will be afforded every opportunity to fully participate in the permitting process (e.g., invited to all field trips and meetings). 
(b)  The permitting agencies positions will not limit the town from applying more stringent requirements to the project, nor will the town's participation in the permitting process be deemed to be an endorsement or approval of the permitting agencies' decisions. The applicant shall process concurrent applications at its own risk, and the town shall not be responsible for any expense or cost suffered by applicant as a result of applicant's decision to process concurrent applications. 
(c)  If, in the judgment of the town the applicant fails to comply with subsection (A)(2)(a) above, the town may immediately disapprove the application for final site plan approval (regardless of the status of the processing); and the applicant shall not resubmit an application for final site plan approval until such time as all outside agency permits have been obtained. 
(d)  Final site plan approval may be delayed until all outside agency permits have been received. The town shall take action on the site plan application within a reasonable time after all agency permits have been received. 
(B)  Upon receipt of the site plan application, the planning and zoning official shall determine the appropriateness and completeness and accept or reject the application in writing. Within a reasonable period of time after the application is found appropriate and complete, the planning and zoning official shall refer the application, together with all supporting documentation and staff weighted options, to the planning and zoning board for their review. The planning and zoning board shall not receive, review, make recommendations or act on applications for site plan approval except during the town's annual site and development plan season. For purposes of this chapter, the annual site and development plan season shall include the months of September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April, May and June of each year. For purposes of calculating the processing times set forth in this section for the planning and zoning board, the period of time between July 1 through August 31 shall not be counted in said computation. 
(C)  Upon receipt of the application from the planning and zoning official, the planning and zoning board shall review the site plan and make findings with respect to the proposed development as set forth in section 158.102. The board shall either approve the application as submitted; approve the application with changes or special conditions; or disapprove the application. For purposes of this section, the planning and zoning board shall receive a site plan application from the planning and zoning official at the board's next regular meeting where a quorum is present following the planning and zoning official's submittal of the application to the board. Appeals of the planning and zoning board's decision shall be in accordance with section 158.031. 
(D)  The applicant may elect to revise the site plan submission at any time in the review process prior to the public hearing before the planning and zoning board. The applicant shall submit a letter of intent to revise to the planning and zoning official who, upon receipt of the letter, will halt the normal review processing. Within a reasonable period of time after receiving the revised documents, the town's planning and zoning official will review the revisions and forward his comments and weighted options to the planning and zoning board. 
(E)  Upon the granting of approval, either as submitted or with changes or special conditions, the town shall, upon receipt of a complete building permit application, issue a building permit for a portion of all of the proposed development after finding that the building permit application is in compliance with chapter 157 and all other town, county, state, and federal requirements which may include the establishment of bonding, or other performance requirements as determined by the town. An approved site plan becomes null and void if: 
(1)  The applicant shall abandon the plan or the section thereof that has been finally approved, and shall so notify the town; or 
(2)  Within 24 months of the date of approval of an application for site plan review, a complete application for building permit has not been submitted to the town and a building permit issued; or 
(3)  A final certificate of occupancy for all phases of the project has not been issued within three years from the date set for receipt of a complete application for building permit for the final building or development phase of the project. 
    The town may extend the period of approval only if special conditions and circumstances exist which do not result from the voluntary actions of the applicant, his representatives or agents, which have caused an unforeseeable delay in the ability of the applicant to submit a complete application for a building permit and/or obtain a final certificate of occupancy for all phases of the project. Economic conditions or financing problems shall not, absent other relevant considerations, form the basis for an extension of the period of approval. The town commission, however, may extend the period of approval if it determines that no material benefit would be derived to the town by requesting the applicant to resubmit an application for site plan approval, in accordance with division 2 of this chapter. 
(F)  Any changes or amendments to an approved site plan shall require a resubmission in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

158.102 - Performance standards for site and development plans. 
    The following standards shall be used by the town in reviewing any site or development plan: 
(A)  Site location and character of use. The comprehensive plan together with the Zoning Code, including size and dimension regulations, general provisions, performance standards, and the list of permitted and conditional uses, off-street parking, landscaping, required open spaces, yards and building setbacks, shall collectively be the principal guides in determining the suitability of the location and design of the proposed use. If the proposed use is a community residential home for seven to 14 residents, then it shall also be reviewed in accordance with Florida State law. 
(B)  Appearance of site and structures. The appearance of site and structures shall be coordinated for the purpose of creating a pleasing and harmonious overall effect. The choice of building materials, plant materials, lighting and other building and site improvements shall be commensurate with the objectives of the subject use without generating adverse visual impact on surrounding properties or transportation corridors. Architectural style or design is not restricted. Evaluation of the appearance of a project shall be based on the quality of its overall design and relationship to the impacted area considering the following factors: 
(1)  Exterior appearance. The exterior of buildings and structures, including mass, facade and materials, shall be in harmony with the site and the impacted area. Awnings or ornamental features shall be designed in a manner harmonious with the building design and shall be of appropriate scale, shape and pattern in order to reinforce good design principles. Similarly, awnings or ornamental features shall not use incompatible or extraordinary scale, shapes, color schemes, patterns or other extraordinary features for purposes of attracting attention. Except for buildings listed on the Florida Master Site File or the National Register of Historic Buildings, i.e., historic buildings, the appearance of buildings and structures shall be disapproved under this section in extreme cases only and reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of the applicant. Exterior alterations to historic buildings may be denied by the building division if not in accordance with the U.S. Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.

(g)  All buildings shall be arranged so as to avoid undue exposure to concentrated loading or parking facilities wherever possible and shall be so oriented as to preserve visual and audible privacy between adjacent buildings. 
(h)  All buildings shall be arranged so as to be accessible to emergency vehicles. 
(3)  Screening of mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment or other utility hardware shall be harmonious with the building and shall be screened from the public way as well as from view of tenants within adjacent buildings by use of either landscaping or architectural features or a combination of both. Mechanical equipment and utilities in or adjacent to residential areas shall be designed in a manner which minimizes nuisance impacts, such as noise and odor, and shall be landscaped and screened in order to minimize adverse visual impacts and enhance their general appearance and to preserve the stability and integrity of adjacent residential areas. 
(4)  Maintenance of activities within enclosed building. All businesses or services should be conducted within completely enclosed buildings in all zoning districts, except as provided for in the Town Code of Ordinances. 
(5)  Exterior lighting. Exterior lighting shall be so arranged as to shield or deflect the light from adjoining properties and public streets. 
(C)  Maximum floor area ratio. 
(1)  The total square footage of floor area permitted in any zone shall be determined as a ratio to the total square footage of the gross land area of the site. 
(a)  When computing gross land area for this ratio in the MUC-1 and MUC-2 zoning districts, the gross land area includes land under common ownership even if separated by an intervening privately owned street. 
(b)  The ratio in residential or tourism facilities shall be determined from the table shown in subsection (C)(2) below, and shall be based on the maximum gross residential density (see section 158.006) of the site. 
(c)  The floor area shall be the sum of areas for residential and tourism use on all floors of the building measured from the outside faces of the exterior walls, including halls, lobbies, stairways, elevator shafts, enclosed porches and balconies, and below-grade floor areas used for habitation and residential access, excluding parking garages. 
(d)  Commercial space and nonresidential space such as open terraces, garages, common use areas and nonhabitable basement spaces are noncountable. 
(2)  For the purpose of the table below, the following definitions shall apply: 
    "Living space ratio." The minimum square footage of nonvehicular outdoor space required for each square foot of floor area. When computing this ratio in the MUC-1 and MUC-2 districts, nonvehicular outdoor space includes gross land area under common ownership even if separated by an intervening privately owned street. 
    "Open space ratio." A minimum square footage of lot area not covered by buildings (excluding parking structures) required for each square foot of floor area. When computing this ratio in the MUC-1 and MUC-2 districts, open space includes gross land area under common ownership even if separated by an intervening privately owned street. 
    "Recreation space ratio." The minimum square footage of active recreation space required for each square foot of floor area.

Driveways and areas for parking and internal circulation of vehicles shall be located, designed and controlled so as to provide for safe and convenient circulation within the site and safe and convenient access from adjoining streets. Parking requirements of the Zoning Code shall be applied for calculating required off-street parking. Among factors to be considered shall be the number and location of access drives from adjacent streets, the location and width of driveways and access aisles to parking spaces, the arrangement of parking areas and means of access to buildings for fire fighting apparatus and other emergency vehicles. All nonresidential and residential development and uses except for single-family homes, shall be required to provide adequate off-street parking and facilities for on-site backup and turnaround movements. Parking areas and driveways shall be clearly identified and separated from principal pedestrian routes and recreation areas by curbs, pavement markings, planting areas, fences or similar features designed to promote pedestrian safety. 
(E)  Traffic impacts. A traffic impact analysis shall be required, except for voluntary reconstruction without additional units, pursuant to standards, procedures and criteria defined herein for future land use plan map amendments, outline development plans including amendments thereto, and zoning amendments when the change will increase the total number of trips generated for any of the above application types. If a specific land use is not known at the time of a future land use plan map amendment, outline development plan application, or zoning amendment the highest trip generation rate of all the permitted uses shall be used in the calculation. A traffic impact analysis shall also be required for all major and minor development except as provided herein, pursuant to standards, procedures and criteria defined herein. The traffic impact analysis shall be performed by a qualified Florida registered engineer employed by the town at the applicant's expense. The traffic impact analysis is designed to achieve objectives stipulated in the traffic circulation element of the comprehensive plan. 
(1)  Applicability. A transportation impact study shall be required if: 
(a)  A proposed development generates more than 100 trips per day. Such development shall maintain a level of service C for peak season, peak hour for local and collector roads, and level of service E for peak season, peak hour conditions along Gulf of Mexico Drive. All intersections on Gulf of Mexico Drive within the town will operate at level of service E or better in the peak season peak hour. All other intersections within the town will operate at LOS D or better in the peak season peak hour. The peak season adjustment factor will be determined annually through coordination with the FDOT, District 1 Office. The trip generation rate shall be based on the most recent edition of the "Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual", unless the applicant can demonstrate that unique development characteristics will result in substantially different rates. 
(2)  Impact study areas. The transportation impact study area shall include all arterial and collector streets within one-half mile of the site entrance and/or shall include the nearest arterial roads that will be impacted by the development. For developments which generate between 250 and 1,000 trips during the peak hour or over 1,000 trips during the peak hour, the study area shall be one and three miles respectively. Estimates of peak hour trip generation shall be determined by the town's, Florida registered engineer. Peak hour traffic impact shall be assessed, with and without the development, for all collector and arterial road segments and their respective intersections with other collector and arterial roadways within the designated service area. If additional traffic counts are warranted, they shall be undertaken at the direction of the town's, Florida registered engineer at the applicant's expense. 
(3)  Contents. The transportation impact analysis report shall contain the following: 
(a)  A detailed description of the collector and arterial road network within the impact study area, including existing and proposed roadway widths and right-of-way widths; existing and proposed traffic signals and traffic-control devices; existing and proposed ingress and egress locations, including existing or proposed acceleration or deceleration lanes or turning lane improvements. 
(b)  A detailed description of the existing and proposed land uses within the impacted study area. 
(c)  A detailed level of service C condition analysis of all local and collector roads and a detailed service level E condition analysis of arterial roadways and intersections within the study area based on procedures outlined in the most recent edition of the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual. 
(d)  A description of all the existing collector and arterial roadways and intersections that are at or below the service level C condition (service levels C, D, E or F). 
(e)  A detailed analysis of traffic impact of the development, including trip generations (peak season peak hour), internal and external trips, trip absorptions and trip distributions over all collector and arterial roads within the study area. The trip generation shall be based on the table referenced in this subsection unless a qualified traffic engineer demonstrates that unique qualities of the development will result in different rates. All methodology and assumptions must be clearly stated. 
(f)  A detailed cumulative transportation impact of the existing traffic conditions, including traffic from the development, normal increases in traffic and increases from allocation of road capacity to already approved projects. This analysis must identify projected peak season peak hour volumes for all the local, collector and arterial roads and must describe all the roadways and intersections that will be at or below the adopted level of service. 
(4)  Traffic study and traffic data inventory and file. The town planning and zoning official shall keep a file on all traffic studies including the future capacity allocated for each project. In determining the projected demand in subsection (E)(3)(f) above, the impact analysis shall include all trips already allocated in previous development proposals. Should a project's development plan expire pursuant to other provisions of this chapter, the allocated capacity of each affected facility shall become reallocable coincident with the expiration of the development plan. The town shall provide information when available and where appropriate data already exists in order to prevent duplication of efforts and unnecessary costs. 
(5)  Improvements to roadways and/or traffic-control devices. Transportation improvements such as intersection improvements; additional turning, acceleration or deceleration lanes; modified land delineations; new or improved traffic-control devices; or other such improvements may be required in order to maintain the required level of service. In such case, the applicant for a development permit may be required to fund and/or install the necessary improvements or provide a legal assurance, such as a performance bond or other surety approved by the town attorney, prior to the receipt of a building permit. Where the traffic impact does not generate traffic volume that substantiates the total improvement needs, the planning and zoning board shall determine an equitable participation in the required improvement. The participation by the applicant may, at the discretion of the planning and zoning board, consist of a pro rata dollar share of improvement costs. 
(F)  Open space and landscape. Open space for the purpose of calculating residential, nonresidential and mixed use open space requirements of this subsection shall be defined as those areas not defined as impermeable surface as provided for in section 158.006. The calculation of open space coverage shall be verified by a licensed design professional. Active recreation areas may be counted as open space as provided for in section 158.006. Parking lots and driveways, whether paved or unpaved, shall not be included as open space. Swimming pools shall not count as open space. Other active recreation areas which are not defined as impermeable surface as provided for in section 158.006 and not covered by an impermeable structure shall be included as open space. 
(1)  Residential open space requirement. All residential development shall preserve a minimum of 50 percent of the gross land areas as open space. Of the required 50 percent open space only a maximum of 60 percent of the total required open space acreage may be comprised of a golf course. The intent is to maximize usable active and passive open space and recreation area and to require good principles of urban design, including walkway systems which provide access to unique open spaces, courtyards, sitting areas, and other usable areas near the principal residential structures. Wetlands and landlocked waterbodies may be used in calculating open space, as long as minimum of 40 percent of the upland property is comprised of open space. 
(2)  Nonresidential open space requirement. All tourist accommodations including motels, hotels and tourist resort facilities, shall provide a minimum of 50 percent of the gross land area as open space. Wetlands and landlocked waterbodies may be used in calculating open space as long as a minimum of 40 percent of the upland property is comprised of open space. Other more conventional forms of nonresidential development shall provide a minimum of 20 percent open space. Wetlands and landlocked waterbodies may be used in calculating open space as long as minimum of 15 percent of the upland property is comprised of open space. 
(3)  Mixed use open space requirement. Where residential and nonresidential development is permitted pursuant to this chapter, the following pro rata open space requirements shall be enforced. 
OS = NRA × .2 TA + RA × .5 TA TA TA  
OS Open space NRA Nonresidential acreage RA Residential and resort facilities acreage TA Total area  
(4)  Use of open space. Open space and spaces between buildings required by this chapter shall be located and improved so as to reasonably serve the purposes for which the requirements are intended. These purposes include provisions of adequate light and air, appropriate separation between buildings and uses, enhancement of privacy, sufficient area for recreation and leisure pursuits (in residential areas) and to facilitate surface water drainage. 
(5)  Preserve natural landscape, native vegetation and significant wildlife species and their habitats. Any development proposal that threatens mortality to rare, endangered, and/or threatened wildlife, marine life, and/or plant life or species of special concern, or alters the natural processes of wetlands will not be approved by the town. The natural landscape of the site shall be preserved as much as possible for purposes of enhancing the general appearance of the site as well as to prevent excessive stormwater runoff, erosion, siltation and dust. Sand dunes and natural landscape barriers fronting on the Gulf of Mexico shall be preserved, enhanced and restored to the greatest extent possible through the land development process. In landscaping efforts, priority is given to removing nuisance exotics, maintaining native trees, and using vegetation that is dry season and wet season tolerant. Every effort shall be made to avoid the removal of native vegetation. Wherever such native vegetation has to be removed however (i.e., having a diameter of four inches or more), the applicant shall either replant or replace each tree on the site at the rate of at least two mature trees for every tree removed. All landscaping activities and work resulting from this condition shall be incorporated into a landscaping plan to be submitted to the town. All landscaping work shall not only meet the conditions of this development order but also the provisions of the Town of Longboat Key Tree Ordinance. 
(a)  Specimen or habitat of terrestrial species on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) lists, as amended, will not be adversely impacted by development unless appropriate mitigation is approved by the appropriate government agencies. 
(b)  Specimen or habitat of bayside marine species on the appropriate lists shall not be altered by new dredging activity, while existing channels may be maintained only to their original dimension. 
(c)  Specimens or habitat of gulfside marine species on the USFWS lists may be affected by beach restoration efforts, but only after such efforts are assessed and adequate mitigation programs are instituted for the affected species. 
(G)  Wetland development restrictions. Site specific investigations shall confirm the existence of wetland areas (see section 158.006) based on on-site soil and vegetative analysis with assistance of appropriate representatives of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD), the U.S. Soil Conservation Service and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. No development activity shall be allowed in a wetland area unless "competent evidence" indicates that: 
(1)  Dominant vegetation is no longer comprised of wetland types. 
(2)  The water regime has been permanently altered artificially or naturally in a manner to preclude its associated watershed areas from functioning as wetlands and cannot function as part of the stormwater management system for the site. Applicants for site plan review shall have an opportunity to demonstrate that any wetland designations within the confines of their property no longer functions as wetlands, including its function as part of the stormwater management system, as defined above. The urban forester, the soil conservationist, as well as representatives of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Southwest Florida Water Management District, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, shall be made a part of the site plan review process to assist in identifying and delineating wetlands. The applicant may request a waiver of the provisions of this section for docks or relatively small isolated marginal wetlands for which the developer shall provide viable compensatory preserve areas which mitigate against a loss of viable wetland systems. Subject to the provisions of this section, no development shall be permitted in wetlands. However, where land is held under unity of title (common ownership) and such properties include both uplands and wetlands, density credit may be granted for wetland acreage with approval of the planning and zoning board subject to provisions to be established in the land development code. However, in calculating credit for density in wetland areas, landward of the mean high-water line, in no case shall density credits exceed half the gross density assigned to the wetland area pursuant to the comprehensive plan land use map. No credit for density shall be given for wetland areas seaward of the mean high-water line. Furthermore, the net residential density in the upland area shall not exceed 1.5 times the gross density assigned to the site. 
(H)  Surface water management. All stormwater runoff from development sites and construction sites shall meet applicable Southwest Florida Water Management District and Florida Department of Environmental Protection applicable stormwater and wastewater discharge requirements; and all development and construction applications shall be reviewed to assure adequate drainage, flood prevention, and protection of water quality. The developer/owner of any site will be responsible for the on-site management of runoff in such a manner that post-development discharge rates will not exceed pre-development conditions and requirements. No stormwater should be discharged directly into Sarasota Bay or the Gulf of Mexico unless it has been detained on-site in accordance with local and state regulations and conveyed to the open water in an acceptable manner. 
(1)  Flood control policies. The flood control ordinance, surface water drainage and flood control policies of the subdivision ordinance and other applicable rules and regulations of the Town of Longboat Key together with the flood management criteria and the Stormwater Treatment and Storage Regulations of the Southwest Florida Water Management District shall be used as a basis for reviewing surface water management plans. In case of conflict the more restrictive provision shall govern. 
(2)  Surface water management plans. Surface water management plans shall be submitted by the applicant as part of all site plan reviews and shall be approved pursuant to procedures included in the Town of Longboat Key's Land Development Code, prior to the issuance of a building permit for any construction, including construction incidental to a new or changed use or major expansion. The intent is that criteria within the town's subdivision ordinance for managing surface waters shall also be applied in review of development proposed for site plan review. Furthermore, the intent is to assure to the greatest feasible extent that all future development occurs at an intensity which will not impede or adversely impact natural hydrologic systems. The intent is that new development, redevelopment and expanded or changed uses to be planned, designed, and constructed to include design features necessary to achieve the following objectives: 1) prevent or restrict the construction of buildings in the most frequently flooded areas; 2) require the elevation or floodproofing of buildings in less frequently flooded areas; 3) restrict interference with the normal movement of floodwaters; and 4) restrict increases in the rate or volume of surface water discharge. 
(3)  Runoff from construction sites. Construction activities shall implement proper erosion and sediment control practices at construction sites to minimize the amount of pollutant entering the stormwater system. 
(4)  Domestic wastewater. There shall be no connection to a storm system, or manmade or natural waterway from any domestic wastewater systems such as wastewater collection and transmission systems or septic tank systems. Prohibited connections may consist of piping connections, exfiltration, infiltration, seepage, leaks or ditching. 
(5)  Surface water management criteria. The town may waive this requirement for minor construction as shall be hereafter defined by the town. Criteria for managing such waiver procedures shall be established as a departmental operations policy and shall be adopted by resolution of the town commission. All publications incorporated in the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) criteria for review of surface water management shall be used in planning and reviewing surface water management within the Town of Longboat Key. New or updated criteria approved for use by the Southwest Florida Water Management District or by the town may be used to review and adequately manage water quality and drainage system improvements. The owner of any facility which fails to comply with these criteria will be required to cease all discharges to the storm sewer system unless such discharges are in strict conformity with all federal, state or town permits or other local law or regulation. 
(6)  Surface water management review coordination. The town shall coordinate the surface water management review process with the SWFWMD to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort. The town may maintain more restrictive standards for review in order to adequately assess and manage surface water drainage within the town limits. 
(I)  Available potable water. 
(1)  All new and existing development shall be required to connect to the town's public water system except that development on islands geographically separated from the main island of the town may be exempted from this requirement. Any water service systems improvements required by proposed development or redevelopment shall be designed to satisfy performance standards of the state, county and/or the Town of Longboat Key. 
(2)  All new development that requires additional potable water in an amount in excess of 500 gallons per day shall enter into a development agreement with the town to insure that the additional potable water capacity required by the development is purchased from the Manatee County Water Utility, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement between Manatee County and the Town of Longboat Key then in effect. 
(J)  Wastewater service. All new and existing development shall be required to connect to the town's central wastewater utility except that development on islands geographically separated from the main island of the town may be exempted from this requirement. Any wastewater service systems shall be designed to satisfy performance standards of the state, county, and/or Town of Longboat Key. 
(K)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control. 
(1)  Applicability. In order to prevent both soil erosion and sedimentation, a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be required as a part of an application for site plan review whenever a development will involve any clearing, grading, transporting, or other form of disturbing land by the movement of earth, including the mining of minerals, sand and gravel, provided that any one of the following descriptions applies to said movement: 
(a)  Excavation, fill, or any combination thereof will exceed 250 cubic yards. 
(b)  Fill will exceed three feet in vertical depth at its deepest point as measured from the natural ground surface. 
(c)  Excavation will exceed four feet in vertical depth at its deepest point as measured from the natural ground surface. 
(d)  Excavation, fill or any combination thereof will exceed an area of 5,000 square feet. 
(e)  Plant and/or tree cover is to be removed from an area exceeding 5,000 square feet on any parcel of land. 
(f)  Whenever any land located in a stream, stream channel, or body of water is disturbed, a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be provided. 
(2)  Definitions. For the purposes of this subsection, the following definitions are provided: 
(a)  "Soil erosion". Any removal and/or loss of soil by the action of water, gravity or wind. Erosion includes both the detachment and transport of soil particles. 
(b)  "Sedimentation". The settling out of the soil particles which are transported by water or wind. Sedimentation occurs when the velocity of water or wind in which soil particles are suspended is slowed to a sufficient degree and for a sufficient period of time to allow the particles to settle out of suspension or when the degree of slope is lessened to achieve the same result. 
(c)  "Erodable slope". All slopes with inclines in excess of four percent unless modified by the public works director based on consideration of specific soil conditions. 
(d)  "Large flat surface area (unpaved)". An area which is flat or whose slope is less than four percent and which consists of more than 1,000 square feet of exposed soil. 
(3)  Erosion-control measures. All best management practices necessary to minimize soil erosion and to control sedimentation in the disturbed land area shall be implemented. Soil erosion and sedimentation by wind and water shall be minimized by retaining or restoring vegetation during and after construction. Protection shall be provided for all disturbed areas: minimize velocities of water runoff, maximize protection of disturbed areas from stormwater runoff, and retain sedimentation within the development site as early as possible following disturbances. A list of major problem areas for erosion and sedimentation control follows. For each one, the purpose(s) of requiring control is described. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures for all such areas shall be provided with a view toward achieving the specific purpose listed below for which a control plan is required: 
(a)  Erodable slopes. Prevent detachment and transportation of soil particles from slope. 
(b)  Streams, streambeds, streambanks, bodies of water, lake shorelines. Prevent detachment and transportation of soil particles. 
(c)  Drainageways. Prevent detachment and transportation of soil particles (which would otherwise deposit in streams, bodies of water, or wetlands); promote deposit or sediment loads (traversing these areas) before these reach bodies of water. 
(d)  Land adjacent to the gulf, bay, tributaries and wetlands. Prevent detachment and transportation of soil particles. 
(e)  Enclosed drainage structure. Prevent sedimentation in structure, erosion at outfall of system, and deposit of sediment loads within system or beyond it. 
(f)  Large flat surface areas (unpaved). Prevent detachment of soil particles and their off-site transportation. 
(g)  Impervious surfaces. Prevent the detachment and transportation of soil (in response to an increase in the rate and/or volume of runoff of the site or its concentration caused by impervious surfaces). 
(h)  Borrow and stockpile areas. Divert runoff from face of slopes which are exposed in the excavation process; convey runoff in stabilized channels to stable disposal points; leave borrow areas and stockpiles in stable condition. 
(i)  Adjacent properties. Prevent their erosion and/or being deposited with sediment. 
(L)  Supplemental controls for multifamily residential or tourism uses. In reviewing the proposed site plan for ten or more multifamily or tourism units, the town shall be guided by the following controls. The supplemental control relating to the maximum length of buildings, as provided for in subsection (3) of this section, shall be taken as a mandatory requirement which cannot be waived by the town commission. The remaining controls in this section shall be taken as mandatory requirements, except that the town commission may waive one or more of these requirements where it determines a hardship exists Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, for properties located in a planned unit development, the town commission may consider and grant a departure, under the standards for a requested departure as outlined in subsection 158.067(D), for one or more of the supplemental controls of this subsection 158.102(L), including subsection (3) for the maximum length of buildings. 
    In any development order approving a site plan, the town commission shall make specific findings of facts constituting a hardship, if a hardship is found to exist, and shall make specific findings of any facts constituting the basis for a waiver of these supplemental controls. 
    The provisions of section 158.029 shall apply in determining whether a waiver shall be granted upon a finding that a hardship exists, except that the town commission, rather than the zoning board of adjustment, shall determine whether a hardship exists or not. The facts forming the basis for the grant of a waiver under the provisions of this section shall be specifically set forth in the development order. 
(1)  Minimum street yards (front setbacks). 
(a)  The distance measured perpendicularly from any front lot line to the nearest surface of a building shall not be less than twice the height of the building, which height shall be measured from the lowest visible elevation under the building to the highest part of the building. 
(b)  Development lots in certain locations within the MUC-2 zoning district shall observe the following street yard (front setback) standards in lieu of the general standard above: 
i.  All buildings must be set back at least 100 feet from Gulf of Mexico Drive, except that a covered entrance portico that is attached to a building can be as close as 50 feet to Gulf of Mexico Drive. 
ii.  Development lots that are separated by a private street from an adjacent lot that is permanently restricted as open space or golf course shall have the minimum street yard (front setback) measured as follows: 
A.  Buildings must be set back from the private street at least a distance equal to their height, but never more than 100 feet. 
B.  If the front of a building has two or more vertical planes, the setback distances apply to each plane. For example, a building with a two-story podium and six stories above the podium must have its podium set back at least a distance equal to the podium's height and the remainder of the building must be set back at least a distance equal to the height of all eight stories, but never more than 100 feet. 
C.  These private street setbacks shall be measured to the edge of the street's pavement. 
(2)  Distance between buildings. No building shall be located closer to another building on the same lot than a distance equal to half the sum of the heights of both buildings (measured from the lowest visible elevation under each building), nor shall any structure be located closer to a site lot line than a distance equal to 70 percent of the building height (measured from the lowest visible elevation under the building). In addition, the front or rear of any building may be no closer to the front or rear of any other building than 40 feet. The side of any building should be no closer to the side, front or rear of any other building than 30 feet. 
    As to subsections (L)(1) and (2), "visible elevation" shall not include elevator shafts, stairwells and other mechanical equipment areas, so long as such areas do not exceed ten percent of the area under the building. 
(3)  Maximum length. No portion of any individual building shall extend beyond a line drawn from the front lot line 30 degrees either side of a line through the building and perpendicular to the front lot line. 
(4)  Distance between buildings and driveways. No driveway or parking lot should be closer than 25 feet to the front of any building or ten feet to the side or rear of any building except where parking under or within the building is proposed or in the case of a front entrance to a building. 
(5)  Off-street parking spaces. There shall be provided on the site of the development an area devoted to the parking of automobiles. The number and their provision shall be provided for as required by section 158.128. 
(M)  All docks and boat facilities shall comply with section 158.155, of the town zoning code and comprehensive plan. 
(N)  school concurrency proportionate-share mitigation program in accordance with section 11 of the appendix to this chapter. 
(O)  Other performance standards. Other performance standards used by the town in reviewing any site or development plan shall include such other standards as may be imposed by this zoning code on the particular use or activity involved.

(b)  Whether the proposed use would be compatible with the established land use pattern. 
(c)  Whether the proposed use would materially alter the population density pattern and thereby increase or overtax the load on public facilities such as schools, utilities and streets. 
(d)  Whether changed or changing conditions find the proposed use to be advantageous to the community and the neighborhood. 
(e)  Whether the proposed use would adversely influence living conditions in the neighborhood. 
(f)  Whether the proposed use would create or excessively increase traffic congestion or otherwise affect public safety. 
(g)  Whether the proposed use would create a drainage problem. 
(h)  Whether the proposed use would seriously reduce the flows of light and air to adjacent areas. 
(i)  Whether the proposed use would adversely affect property values in the adjacent area. 
(j)  Whether the proposed use would be a deterrent to the improvement or development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations. 
(k)  Whether the proposed use would be out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or the town. 
(B)  Expiration. Any special exception shall expire the later of 24 months from the date of grant, or the date of the site plan expiration, as applicable, unless appealed and extended by action of the town commission, if by that date the use for which the special exception was granted has not been commenced.

158.138 - Status of nonconformities. 
(A)  Within the districts established by these zoning regulations or amendments that may be later adopted, there may exist lots, buildings, structures, or uses which are lawful at the effective date of this chapter but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter to permit those nonconformities to continue until they are removed either voluntarily or as required by subsection (B)(5), unsafe structures, or subsection (B)(8)(a), abandonment. It is further the intent that nonconformities shall not be expanded, enlarged upon, intensified, or extended, except as provided hereafter in this section. Furthermore, no expansion, enlargement, intensification extension of a nonconforming structure, building, lot of record, use, or waiver thereof, shall be permitted which increases its nonconformance with present site and development plan performance standards or district regulations, unless provided for in this section or section 158.139. 
(B)  The following policies shall determine the management of nonconformities: 
(1)  Nonconforming lots of record. A permitted or permissible building or structure may be erected, expanded or altered on any lot of record at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives or any legally created amendment thereto. The maximum density to the greatest extent possible, maximum lot coverage, building height and floor area shall conform to the district in which the lot is located, and shall be subject to the requirements below: 
(a)  All nonconforming lots shall: 
1.  Have a minimum required side yard setback of ten feet for each side yard or meet the minimum requirements within its respective district, whichever is less. 
2.  Meet the required yards conforming to the minimums required for the district in which the lot is located. 
(b)  Two or more nonconforming lots or combinations of lots shall be considered an undivided lot for the purposes of this chapter if: 
1.  As of July 21, 1976, the lots were in continuous frontage in single ownership, of record in the appropriate county where located; and 
2.  The lots are deficient in the requirements established for lot width or area. 
(c)  Lot reduction. 
1.  No lot or interest therein shall be transferred, conveyed, or sold as subdivided so as to create a new nonconforming lot, which avoids, circumvents or subverts any provision of this chapter or leaves remaining any lot in violation of the requirements of this chapter. No lot or portion of a lot required as a building site under this chapter shall be used as a portion of a lot required as a building site for another structure. 
2.  No building permit shall be issued for any lot or parcel of land which has been conveyed, sold, or subdivided in violation of this section. Any transferee who acquires a lot in violation of this section, without knowledge of such violation, or any subsequent transferee, shall have the right to rescind and receive damages from the transferor who violates the provisions of this section. 
(2)  Nonconforming buildings or structures. Where a building or structure exists lawfully that could not be built under this chapter or as it may be amended by reason of restrictions on lot area, lot coverage, height, yards, location on the lot, or requirements (other than use) concerning the structure, then the building or structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful; provided further, that: 
(a)  The building or structure may not be altered or enlarged in any way which creates a new nonconformity or increases or enlarges an existing nonconformity; and 
(b)  The building or structure may be altered or enlarged in any way which decreases an existing nonconformity or in any way which is otherwise conforming. 
(3)  Nonconforming use. Where at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or any amendments thereto, lawful use of buildings or structures exists, the use may be continued subject to the provisions of this chapter. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such a use at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or any amendments thereto. Any nonconforming use which occupied a portion of a building not originally designed or intended for such a use shall not be extended to any other part of the building. 
(4)  Repairs. Normal maintenance, repair and incidental alteration of a structure containing a nonconforming use is permitted, provided it does not extend the area or volume of space occupied by the nonconforming use. A building or other structure containing residential nonconforming uses may be altered in any way to improve interior livability; however, no structural alterations shall be made which would increase the number of dwelling units. 
(5)  Unsafe structures. If a nonconforming structure or portion of structure or any structure containing a nonconforming use becomes unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs or maintenance and is declared by the planning and zoning official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of its condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter; and its removal shall be deemed voluntary. 
(6)  Off-street parking. Additional off-street parking may be permitted on other property in the immediate vicinity, subject to the provision of subchapter 3 [article IV, section 158.128] of this chapter. 
(7)  Change in nonconforming uses without structural alteration. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building or structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of a similar or higher (more restrictive) classification under the following conditions: 
(a)  The change in use shall not intensify or enlarge the basic use of the building or premises by increasing the need for more parking facilities, by increasing vehicular or pedestrian traffic, by creating more noise, vibration, fire hazard, smoke, dust or fumes, by increasing hours of operation or number of employees, by increasing ground coverage or adversely impacting drainage, or otherwise result in a more intensive use of the building or premises, or change the basic character of the building or premises except to more nearly conform to the character of the zoning of the district in which the building or structure is located. 
(b)  When a nonconforming use of all or any part of a building, structure or premises is changed to another nonconforming use of a more restricted character, the new use may not thereafter be changed to any nonconforming use. 
(c)  When a nonconforming use of all or any part of a building, structure or premises has been changed to a conforming use, the conforming use shall not thereafter be changed to any nonconforming use. 
(d)  No structural alterations shall be made to any building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use except as permitted in this Code. 
(e)  The parking and landscape provisions of this chapter shall be met. 
(8)  Termination of nonconforming uses and structures. 
(a)  Abandonment. Except as set forth in subsection 158.139(A), providing for the reconstruction of involuntarily destroyed nonconforming structures, buildings or uses, a nonconforming use not used for a period of one year or the change of use to a more restricted or conforming use for any period of time shall be considered an abandonment thereof and the nonconforming use shall not thereafter be revived. 
(b)  Removal of nonconformance; extension of time to comply. A nonconforming building or structure not used or occupied in a lawful manner or vacant for a period of one year or more shall be considered an abandonment and the nonconforming building or structure shall be removed or made conforming. However, should the period of nonuse or vacancy be caused by legal restraints upon the owner, the owner may set forth such grounds in a petition to the town commission and serve such petition on the planning and zoning official. The time may be extended by the town commission for good cause shown. The town commission may require the petitioner to decrease the nonconformity of the building or structure in one or more aspects of its nonconformity. The town commission may require the petitioner to secure the buildings, structures, and/or property in a manner acceptable to the town to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
(c)  Special extension for continuance. The town commission, by resolution, may grant a special extension for the continuance of an abandoned nonconforming building or structure for a period of time to be determined at a public hearing to provide for the removal of the nonconforming building or structure, or the making of the building or structure conforming, on or before the end of the period approved. 
1.  The property owner shall have furnished the town with a good and sufficient surety bond or other security in an amount to be approved by the town commission, to require compliance with this Code and/or state building codes. 
2.  The amount of the surety bond or security shall be established by the town commission at a quasi-judicial public hearing up to an amount of no more than 100 percent of the total value of the property, including structures and land. The value of the property, including structures and land, shall be determined based on the full assessed value prior to any exemptions assigned to said property, including structures and land, according to the most recent tax assessment records for the property. 
3.  The purpose of such bond or security shall be for the town to utilize and draw on such amounts in circumstances where the property owner has failed to provide adequate building, structure, and/or site maintenance to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the public. In such circumstances, the town may elect to utilize such bond or security to bring said property into compliance with town and/or state building codes, which may include, but is not limited to, conditions related to structural demolition, debris removal, site stabilization, utility stabilization, environmental remediation, building maintenance, pest and/or rodent control, site security, pool maintenance, landscape maintenance, potential storm damage, fire, vagrancy and vandalism. 
4.  Nothing within this section shall prohibit the town from any actions deemed necessary by the building official relating to unsafe buildings or structures. 
(9)  Pre-existing legal uses. Certain uses of land that cannot be added under current regulations are legal because they lawfully existed on January 1, 2014, and are authorized as "pre-existing legal uses" on the schedule of uses in section 158.125. "Pre-existing legal uses" uses may also be classified as nonconforming uses, but by virtue of their listing in section 158.125 shall be afforded the privileges of permitted uses and may be reconstructed up to their pre-existing density in accordance with all applicable current regulations, but only on the specific parcels on which they are located. The abandonment and termination provisions in subsection (B)(8) do not apply to uses that qualify as "pre-existing legal uses." 
(C)  Certificate of built conditions. Legally nonconforming structures and uses may be reconstructed (158.139). Certification of nonconforming status, via a certificate of built conditions, may expedite the rebuilding of nonconforming structures pursuant to 158.139 of the Code. A property owner seeking such certification of the legally nonconforming status from the town should file their request with appropriate documentation, as a supplement to, or in-lieu of, records maintained by the town, on a form available from town's planning, zoning and building department. Once an application for certification is submitted, the town's planning and zoning director shall review the application. After a review of the application and supporting documentation submitted by the property owner, in coordination with the town, the town's planning and zoning director shall either grant such certification, deny such certification, or request additional information to substantiate the requested certification. Appeals of any decision of the planning and zoning director relating to a certification decision may be made pursuant to section 158.027. Documentation of existing built conditions will be filed with the Sarasota or Manatee County Clerk of Court so it appears with title/deed searches and will be stipulated to become null and void if a property rezones/redevelops, or if existing development is abandoned.

158.139 - Reconstruction of nonconformities in the event of involuntary destruction or damage. 
(A)  Intent. It is the intent of this section that in the event of involuntary destruction due to natural events to allow noncompliant structures to be rebuilt to the same density and building cubic volume, allowing an increase of height of the structure to correspond with the increase in height required by the flood ordinance(s) and to reduce or eliminate nonconformities, especially gulf and pass waterfront yard setbacks, to the greatest degree possible, as set forth below. 
(B)  Legally nonconforming structures, buildings and uses which are substantially damaged by more than 50 percent in accordance with chapter 154, destroyed or made unsafe or unusable by hurricane, storm surge, or other involuntary act, may be reconstructed to the same building cubic content and number of units in existence prior to the casualty, subject to compliance with the following conditions: 
(1)  Compliance with town ordinances. To the greatest extent possible, such reconstruction shall comply with all codes and regulations of the town. For purposes of this section, "to the greatest extent possible" shall mean bringing the previous nonconformities into conformance with the Town's Code to the extent that it does not create an unnecessary and undue hardship as determined by the town. 
(2)  Prohibition on increase in extent of nonconformities. All such reconstruction shall not increase the extent of the prior existing nonconformities, except for height as addressed below or as a result of modifications approved by the planning and zoning board, and prior existing nonconformities shall be eliminated to the greatest extent possible. 
(3)  Building cubic content. Owners of legally nonconforming structures shall be permitted to rebuild the structure to the same building cubic content that existed prior to the casualty. Additional building volume created as a result of compliance with flood control laws shall not be included in determining building cubic content. Additional areas and volume created for elevators, stairs, landings, mechanical areas and walkways, which were not included in the former structure, shall not be included in building cubic content, provided that the addition of any of these elements does not create a greater nonconformity as to open space or required setback. 
(4)  Unit area increase. So long as there is no increase in overall building cubic content, as determined by subsection (3) above, units within the structure may be increased in cubic volume only as a result of decreasing the number of units within the structure or diminishing the previously existing common areas within the substantially damaged or destroyed building. 
(5)  Time frame for obtaining site plan approval. To qualify for rights under this provision, any such reconstruction shall obtain site plan approval within two years of the date of the casualty. The planning and zoning board may, upon application received prior to the expiration of the two-year period, extend such time for demonstrated cause pursuant to the town's Code. A building permit shall be obtained within the timeframe conditioned at the time of site plan approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the planning and zoning board may in its sole discretion unilaterally extend the date for site plan approval up to an additional two years if, owing to the circumstances of the disaster, such extension is in the best interests of the town. 
(C)  It is the burden of the applicant to establish, to the satisfaction of the town manager or designee, by clear and convincing evidence, through documentation, including, but not limited to, photographs, diagrams, plans, affidavits, and permits, the actual uses, building cubic content, densities, and intensities legally existing prior to the disaster event, prior to seeking site plan approval. 
(D)  Nonconformities and the relaxation of certain controls. To minimize the need for individual variances or departure applications, prior to the approval of reconstruction site plans, the planning and zoning board may, as part of the site plan review process, relax or modify one or several of the controls listed in sections 158.069, 158.102, 158.127, 158.128, 158.145, 158.150 and 158.153 in conformance with this section. However, prior existing nonconformities shall be eliminated to the greatest extent possible. In considering such request, the planning and zoning board shall also consider the nature and character of development in the surrounding area, and the impact thereon, in determining whether, or the degree to which, these controls may be modified. Those controls which may be modified are listed below in order of importance, highest to lowest, such that the control with the highest importance is the control with the greatest need for reduction or elimination of any nonconformities (and least likely of relaxation or modification) and the control with lower importance has a lesser need for reduction or elimination (and more likely of relaxation or modification). 
(1)  Required yards: 
(a)  Properties which were previously permitted to build within a gulf or pass waterfront yard, closer to the water than currently permitted, may continue to enjoy these lawfully existing rights without subsequent planning and zoning board approval, however those properties shall not be able to avail themselves of this Code section regarding reconstruction of nonconformities in the event of involuntary destruction or damage and shall comply in all respects with the codes in effect at the time of the destruction or damage. These properties may, alternatively, waive these previously granted rights and seek approval of the planning and zoning board for encroachments into the required gulf or pass waterfront yard, thus availing themselves of the provisions of this Code section. In accordance with the policies and procedures in this Code section, the planning and zoning board may approve encroachments into a waterfront yard up to the amount of the previously existing encroachment. 
(b)  The approval of a modification to the required gulf or pass waterfront yards shall never be less than 50 feet from the mean high-water line or erosion control line, whichever is most landward, unless the previous legal encroachment was less than 50 feet, in which case the modification may never be less than the previous encroachment. The burden to provide sufficient evidence as to why the modification is necessary and essential to the redevelopment of the site shall be upon the applicant. 
(c)  Street, rear, side, or waterfront yards, other than the gulf waterfront yard, may be modified to: 
(i)  Permit the reconstruction of existing structures that are nonconforming, with minor modifications to the required yards, in order to accommodate an increase in building cubic content, as permitted in subsection (B)(3) of this section; 
(ii)  Permit the reconstruction of existing structures that are nonconforming with regard to a specific setback so long as the reconstruction will not further reduce the setback; 
(iii)  Permit the construction of a handicapped access appurtenance to any reconstruction; or 
(iv)  Allow for the placement of stairs or stair landing that provides access into a reconstructed dwelling unit. 
(d)  Buildings or structures that are not in compliance with the current street, rear, side or waterfront yards regulations, other than the gulf or pass waterfront yards, and can be proven to have been permitted prior to the adoption of such regulations shall be considered legally nonconforming. The street, rear, side or waterfront yards, other than the gulf or pass waterfront yards, may be modified to be reconstructed as it existed prior to the disaster event. 
(2)  Open space: 
(a)  Modifications which reduce the open space requirement of the Zoning Code may be allowed when it: 
(i)  Accommodates modifications to the off-street parking requirements, and utilizes the subsection locating off-street parking at the ground floor level of a structure pursuant to subsections (5)(c) and (d) of this section; or 
(ii)  Accommodates other approved changes to the site as a result of the reconstruction. 
(b)  Reductions from the open space that existed prior to the disaster event shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible to allow for compliance with the town's flood control ordinance, but open space shall not be less than 20 percent of the lot area. 
(3)  Building height: 
(a)  The overall height of a building, at the time of reconstruction, shall be measured from the minimum habitable floor elevation in accordance with the local flood control ordinance, or state mandated height, whichever is applicable. This shall not preclude the utilization of the ceiling of the ground floor parking garage from being utilized as the base measuring point for building height for a multifamily structure, as defined in section 158.006 (definition of "Building, Height of"). 
(b)  The overall height of a building may be increased by a maximum of the additional elevation required to comply with subsection (3)(a) above. 
(4)  Maximum building length, distance between buildings, and distance between buildings and driveways. These development criteria may be modified, but shall not be reduced in a manner that jeopardizes public safety. 
(5)  Off-street parking spaces. 
(a)  In no instance shall the parking requirements be modified where the reconstruction involves the increase of density or intensity of use. 
(b)  Shelters for parking spaces that were previously unsheltered shall not be permitted unless the shelters meet the setback and land coverage requirements for the site. 
(c)  Where to the greatest extent possible, the ground floor area of the reconstructed building shall be utilized for off-street parking. 
(d)  Off-street parking modifications may include the number of spaces provided, minimum dimensions of the stalls, minimum aisle widths, and location of spaces within required yards, and be made to: 
(i)  Improve ingress and egress to the site; 
(ii)  Eliminate or reduce the instances where conditions require that parked vehicles back out onto public/private streets; or 
(iii)  Allow for the provision of handicapped-accessible parking spaces. 
(E)  Site plan approval. 
(1)  All applications for the rebuilding of involuntarily damaged or destroyed nonconforming structures, buildings or uses shall be submitted for site plan review in accordance with article III of this chapter. 
(2)  Permitted uses without site plan review, as listed in section 158.125, are not required to be processed under the site plan review provisions of article III, but can instead be processed in accordance with section 150.31. 
(3)  Permitted uses with site plan review, which meet the provisions of section 158.100, may be exempted from site plan submission requirements, in accordance with said section, and the administrative staff is hereby authorized to modify the controls as set forth herein. 
(F)  The town commission, by emergency ordinance, may develop additional or alternative procedures for the swift processing of applications in cases where a state of emergency is declared; and, in addition, may expand the authority of the administrative staff to relax certain controls by the emergency ordinance. A status report, delineating activities undertaken by the administrative staff under the provisions of this section, shall be provided to the planning and zoning board on a monthly basis. 
(G)  Decisions of the administrative staff, made relative to the provisions of this section, may be appealed by any person to the zoning board of adjustment, in accordance with the appeal procedures set forth in section 158.027. No provision herein, shall be construed to deny the reconstruction, continuance or improvement of legally nonconforming structures, buildings and uses, so long as the reconstruction, continuance or improvement is in accordance with this section. 
(H)  Developments approved by an outline development plan may request departures from the land development regulations through the standard ODP procedures.

158.140 - Reconstruction of nonconformities in the event of voluntary reconstruction. 
(A)  Intent. It is the intent of this section, subject to an applicant meeting all of the criteria set forth below, to allow existing, legally nonconforming multifamily residential or tourism properties that exceed the current allowable density, to be voluntarily demolished and rebuilt for the existing use and density. Existing developments that are legally nonconforming due to the current number of dwelling or tourism units, may be reconstructed to the same building cubic content, the same number of units, and the same type of principal use(s) in existence prior to the reconstruction. 
(1)  For multifamily or tourism use structures whose first habitable floor does not comply with the current flood control ordinance(s) or state requirements, an increase in height of the new structure will be granted equal to the increase in height required by the local flood control ordinance(s) or the state. 
(2)  Voluntary reconstruction under this section allows for the town commission under certain circumstances to allow for modifications of zoning code requirements to comply with federal, state, or local code requirements and limited adjustments from the requirements of this Code as set forth below. 
(3)  Density. 
(a)  The maximum allowable density for voluntary reconstruction under this section shall be the density allowed by the underlying zoning district or the legally nonconforming existing density on the subject site at the time of application, whichever is greater. 
(b)  The number of units approved by the ODP shall become the maximum allowable density. 
(c)  Any additional density between what is allowed by the ODP and what was legally nonconforming shall be lost, forfeited and not available for future development. 
(B)  Nonconformities and code compliance . In conjunction with an application to voluntarily reconstruct a legally nonconforming structure, the town commission may, as part of the review and approval process, permit modifications for one or several of the controls listed in sections 158.069, 158.102, 158.127, 158.128, 158.145, 158.150 and 158.153, in conformance with this section. In considering such request, the town commission shall consider the nature and character of existing and approved future development in the surrounding area, the comprehensive plan, and the impact thereon, in determining whether or the degree to which these controls may be modified. Modifications of zoning code requirements shall be subject to compliance with the following conditions: 
(1)  Compliance with town ordinances. To the greatest extent possible, such reconstruction shall comply with all codes and regulations of the town, to eliminate prior existing nonconformities. For purposes of this section, "to the greatest extent possible" shall mean bringing the previous nonconformities into conformance with the Town's Code to the extent that it does not create an unnecessary and undue hardship as determined by the town. 
(2)  Prohibition on increase in extent of nonconformities. All such reconstruction shall not increase the extent of the prior existing nonconformities, except for height as provided herein, and all prior existing nonconformities shall be eliminated to the greatest extent possible. 
(3)  Modifications of zoning code requirements may be granted for the following: 
(a)  Building height. 
i.  The overall allowable height of a building, at the time of reconstruction, shall be measured from the minimum habitable floor elevation, as required by the local flood control regulations, or state mandated height, whichever is applicable. 
ii.  The overall height of a building may be increased by a maximum of the additional elevation required to comply with subsection (A). 
iii.  Modifications of zoning code requirements for the existing building height, exceeding the application of subsections (B)(3)(a)i. and (B)(3)(a)ii. above, may be requested not to exceed the minimum height necessary to comply with federal, state and town flood regulations and to allow for the maximum use of understructure area for parking to encourage the reduction of nonopen space. The burden to provide sufficient evidence as to why the modification is the minimum necessary and essential to the redevelopment of the site shall be upon the licensed design professional. 
(b)  Building cubic content. Legally nonconforming structures shall be permitted to rebuild the structure to the same building cubic content that existed at the time of application for voluntary reconstruction, subject to compliance with the following conditions: 
i.  Additional building volume created as a result of compliance with flood control laws shall not be included in determining building cubic content. 
ii.  Additional areas and volume created for elevators, stairs, landings, mechanical areas and walkways required to meet all applicable code requirements and minimum legal standards, which were not included in the former structure, shall not be included in building cubic content, provided that the addition of any of these elements does not create a greater nonconformity as to open space or required setback. 
iii.  Unit area. So long as there is no increase in overall building cubic content, as determined by the applicable subsection of (B)(3)(b), subject to compliance with all other conditions of this section, units within the structure may be increased in cubic volume as a result of decreasing the number of units to be reconstructed or by diminishing the previously existing common areas within the building. 
(c)  Open space. The required open space may be modified, but shall not be less than what existed prior to the voluntary redevelopment or a minimum of 50 percent of the lot area. 
(d)  Yard areas. Buildings or structures that are not in compliance with the current street, rear, side or waterfront yards regulations, other than the gulf or pass waterfront yards, and can be proven to have been permitted prior to the adoption of such regulations shall be considered legally nonconforming. The street, rear, side or waterfront yards, other than the gulf or pass waterfront yards, may be modified to be reconstructed as it existed prior to the application for voluntary reconstruction. The burden to provide evidence, sufficient to establish that the modification is the minimum necessary and essential to the redevelopment of the site, shall be upon the licensed design professional. 
i.  Modifications may be permitted to yard areas for the construction of a handicapped access appurtenance to the minimum legal standards necessary for any reconstruction. 
ii.  Modifications may be permitted to yard areas for the placement of stairs or stair landings that provide access into a reconstructed dwelling unit to the minimum code standard. 
(C)  Limited adjustments. Limited adjustments may be granted to the following controls in order to benefit the public interest. The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant. The benefit to the public interest shall be demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence and that the adjustments are necessary and essential to the application. 
(1)  Building height. 
(a)  Adjustments to the existing building height, exceeding the application of subsection (B)(3)(a), may be requested. 
(b)  Additional height permitted by the zoning code does not require an adjustment. 
(2)  Unit area. 
(a)  Units within the structure may be increased in cubic volume, as a result of increasing unit square footage, only if there is sufficient open space on the property to accommodate the increased square footage, and the structure complies with the building coverage requirements of the site. 
(b)  The floor area ratio (FAR) for the proposed structure shall not exceed the FAR of the existing structure or that allowed by the underlying zoning district, whichever is greater. 
(3)  Required yards. Properties that were previously permitted to build within a gulf or pass waterfront yard, closer to the water than currently permitted, must comply with the minimum required gulf or pass waterfront yard to the greatest extent possible. These properties may request an adjustment to decrease the required yard, but in no case shall the adjustment permit encroachments into a waterfront yard further than the amount of the previously existing encroachment. 
(a)  The adjustment to the required gulf or pass waterfront yards shall never be less than 50 feet from the mean high-water line or erosion control line, whichever is most landward. 
(b)  If the structure cannot be otherwise constructed, adjustments to the required street, rear, side or waterfront yards, other than the gulf and pass waterfront yards, may be requested subject to compliance with the following: 
i.  Adjustments may be permitted to yard areas for the reconstruction of existing structures that are nonconforming, with adjustments to the required yards, in order to accommodate an increase in building cubic content as permitted in subsection (B)(3)(b) building cubic content, and shall be subject to the following limits:

(4)  Open space. Adjustments may be granted so long as the provided open space is no less than 20 percent of the land area. 
(5)  Off-street parking spaces. 
(a)  In no instance shall the parking requirements be modified where the reconstruction involves the intensity of use. 
(b)  Shelters for parking spaces that were previously unsheltered shall not be permitted unless the shelters meet the setback and land coverage requirements for the site. 
(c)  To the greatest extent possible, the ground floor area of the reconstructed building shall be utilized for off-street parking. 
(d)  Requested adjustments to the off-street parking requirements of the zoning code may include the number of spaces provided, minimum dimensions of the stalls, minimum aisle widths, and location of spaces within required yards only when clear and convincing evidence is submitted that the adjustment will: 
i.  Improve ingress and egress to the site; 
ii.  Eliminate or reduce the instances where conditions require that parked vehicles back out onto public/private streets; or 
iii.  Allow for the provision of handicapped accessible parking spaces. 
(6)  If ten or more units cannot be otherwise constructed, the following adjustments to the supplemental controls for setbacks, maximum building length, distance between buildings, and distance between buildings and driveways for buildings may be requested: 
(a)  Maximum building length. Adjustments to the allowable building length may be granted so long as the proposed side yards comply with the underlying zoning district of the property.

158.150 - Yard regulations. 
(A)  Generally. Every part of a required yard must be open to the sky unobstructed except for the ordinary projections of steps, sills, belt courses, cornices, and other ornamental features projecting not more than four inches from the building wall except as otherwise provided for in this chapter. This restriction shall include boats, motors, vehicles, bicycles, carts, recreational items, sundries, vending machines, and items of a similar nature offered for sale, display, rental or hire. 
(1)  Village study overlay area, overhangs and porches. Appendix 9(A) of this chapter defines the area of the town known as "the village study overlay area". Appendix 9(B) illustrates that portion of the village study overlay area to which subsections (a) and (b) below, overhangs and porches, may be applied. This area is zoned R-6SF and is characterized by small and narrow lots. 
(a)  Overhangs. Roof overhangs no greater than two feet wide measured from the exterior building wall shall be permitted to project into the required yard setbacks. 
(b)  Porches. A single story porch accessed from the first livable floor and measured from the exterior building wall shall be permitted for each principal building to encroach up to ten feet into the street yard setback. 
(B)  Required side street yards. Any corner lot shall have a required side street yard equal in width to the minimum required street yard setback of any adjoining lot fronting on the side street. 
(C)  Reserved. 
(D)  Required waterfront yard requirements. 
(1)  Required gulf waterfront yard. Every lot which abuts the Gulf of Mexico or an established erosion control line shall have, on the gulfside, a required gulf waterfront yard. The required gulf waterfront yard shall be a minimum of 150 feet in depth. The seaward edge of the yard from which the depth shall be measured shall be the mean high-water line; except that, where an erosion control line has been established, the depth shall be measured from that line. 
(a)  Where the state coastal construction control line for Manatee County and the original proposed state coastal construction setback line for Sarasota County, on file in the town hall, lies more than 150 feet upland from the mean high-water line or erosion control line, the state coastal construction setback line shall be the landward edge of the required gulf waterfront yard. In no event, however, shall the required gulf waterfront yard be less than a minimum of 150 feet in depth, except as provided for in subsection (b) below. 
(b)  No structures, buildings, swimming pools (except as provided in section 158.127), drives, vehicular parking, walls and fences may be built within the required gulfside waterfront yard except for beach shelters, beach access parking on land owned or controlled by the public, pool fences and windwalls, as defined in section 158.006, and dune walkover structures, sand fences, accessory decks or marine structures as authorized in chapter 151. 
(c)  Pool fences located in required gulf waterfront yards shall only encircle the minimum area necessary to ensure child safety, and such area shall not exceed a distance of 20 feet around the perimeter of the pool, pool curb, diving boards, diving towers and slides. 
(d)  Windwalls located in required gulf waterfront yards shall only be permitted as a special exception use in accordance with the provisions of section 158.126 and, in addition, must meet the following criteria: 
1.  No site plan exemption (section 158.100) may be granted for a windwall. 
2.  The protection of private property outweighs any significant public benefits which may be realized. 
3.  Natural approaches have been utilized, to the extent practicable, to protect property prior to the granting of the special exception. 
4.  The windwall is to be erected specifically for the purpose of protecting structures from wind and/or water driven sand with a preference being given to inhabited structures, as opposed to uninhabited structures. 
5.  The windwall shall be built as a minor structure, not a marine structure, not to exceed three feet in height, with minimum penetration into the ground necessary to support the wall. 
6.  The windwall shall be located as far landward as possible and as near as possible to the structure(s) it is to protect, preferably within ten feet of the structure(s). 
7.  The windwall does not jeopardize the stability of the natural beach and dune system, contribute to beach erosion, and/or adversely impact upon upland property. 
8.  In granting the special exception for a windwall, the town: 
a.  May require mitigation work (e.g., planting vegetation and/or depositing sand) toward accomplishing the criteria set forth in subsections 2.-7. above, consistent with best coast management practices; 
b.  Shall assure that efforts are made to use natural approaches, to the extent practicable, in conjunction with the windwall to further enhance the protection of the structures and the natural environment in a manner which is consistent with best coastal management practices. 
(e)  No variance shall be granted from the requirements of this subsection (D), except that the board of adjustment may grant a variance for a single-family dwelling so long as the legal requirements for a variance are met, but the setback shall never be less than 50 feet from the mean high-water line or erosion control line, whichever is most landward. This provision shall not be construed to preclude decreases from the required gulf waterfront yard through the planned unit development (PUD) process, if applicable, but the setback shall never be less than 50 feet from the mean high-water line or erosion control line, whichever is most landward. 
(2)  Required pass waterfront yard. Every lot which abuts New Pass or Longboat Pass shall have, on the pass side, a required pass waterfront yard. The required pass waterfront yard shall be a minimum of 150 feet in depth. The seaward edge of the required yard from which the depth shall be measured shall be the mean high-water line, except that, where an erosion control line has been established, the depth shall be measured from that line. The landward edge of the required yard shall be determined in the same manner as the required gulf waterfront yard, in accordance with subsection (D) of this section [subsection (1)(d) of this subsection (D)]. No structures, buildings, swimming pools (except as provided in section 158.127), drives, vehicular parking, walls and fences may be built within the required pass waterfront yard except for beach shelters as defined in section 158.006, beach access parking on land owned or controlled by the public, dune walkover structures, accessory decks, outdoor dining areas as defined in section 158.006 and in compliance with section 158.136, a dock access ramp or stairs, a ladder or other device pursuant to subsection 158.151(F)(2), or marine structures as authorized in chapter 151. Subject to site plan review, the required pass waterfront yard may be used for other purposes if it lies within an M-1 district. No variance shall be granted from these requirements; however, a variance for a single-family dwelling may be permitted by the board of adjustment where the setback requirement cannot be applied, but can never be less than 50 feet from the mean high-water line or erosion control line, whichever is most landward. 
(3)  Required bay waterfront yard. Every lot which abuts Sarasota Bay shall have, on the bay side, a bayside waterfront yard. The waterfront yard is a required yard and shall not be utilized for any purpose other than docks, open area, landscaping, a dock access ramp or stairs, a ladder or other device pursuit to subsection 158.151(F)(2), or outdoor dining area as defined in section 158.006 and in compliance with section 158.136, except within an M-1 District which shall be subject to site plan review. The required bay waterfront yard shall not be less than 50 feet measured from the bulkhead, bulkhead line, or mean high-water line, whichever is most landward except that a single-family residence not located in an Island Preserve Residential District may not be located closer than 20 feet to the bulkhead or bulkhead line or mean high-water line. 
(4)  Required canal yard. Every lot which abuts a canal or waterway other than the Gulf of Mexico or Sarasota Bay or the passes thereto shall have, on the waterside, a required canal waterfront yard. The waterfront yard is a required yard and shall not be utilized for any purpose other than docks, open area, landscaping, a dock access ramp or stairs, a ladder or other device pursuant to subsection 158.151(F)(2), or outdoor dining area as defined in section 158.006 and in compliance with section 158.136, except within an M-1 District which shall be subject to site plan review. 
    The required canal waterfront yard shall not be less than 30 feet measured from the mean high-water line, bulkhead, or bulkhead line, whichever is most landward except that: 
(a)  A single-family residence not located in an Island Preserve Residential District shall have a required canal waterfront yard not less than 20 feet; or 
(b)  A single-family residence located entirely within the "special canal waterfront yard area" illustrated in the appendix: "land use charts and illustrations", section 6, shall comply with the following provisions: 
1.  Existing structures not elevated in compliance with the town flood control code shall comply with the following minimum required canal waterfront yard standards:

(E)  Standards for all other eligible applications. All other eligible applications for additional tourism units must be part of an ODP application that follows the procedures and meets the standards in this Code. In determining whether additional tourism units will be allocated, the town commission will evaluate the quality of each application using the following criteria. An ideal application would meet all eight "best" criteria: 
(1)  Building height: 
(a)  Better: Taller buildings are located away from the edges of parcels to minimize adverse impacts on adjoining land. 
(b)  Best: Buildings are similar in height to existing buildings that will remain on the site and to buildings on adjoining parcels. 
(2)  Off-street parking: 
(a)  Better: The impacts of off-street parking are minimized through the use of understructure parking or the construction of freestanding parking garages that are shielded from public view by liner buildings that contain habitable uses. 
(b)  Best: The impacts of off-street parking are minimized through valet parking, shared parking lots for peak parking loads, convenient public transit, and/or high-quality bicycle and pedestrian facilities. 
(3)  Open spaces: 
(a)  Better: Open spaces meet current requirements with minimal departures. 
(b)  Best: Open spaces are sited and designed to provide maximum visual appeal to surrounding properties; landscaping blocks undesirable views of parking and service facilities. 
(4)  Recreation: 
(a)  Better: The development will provide generous on-site recreational opportunities, or proximity and connection to ample off-site recreational opportunities such as boat dockage, tennis courts, golf courses, or nature trails. 
(b)  Best: The development will provide guests with direct legal access to the beach or bay. 
(5)  Stormwater: 
(a)  Better: Stormwater runoff is appropriately detained and treated in above ground basins that serve additional active functions. 
(b)  Best: Stormwater runoff is appropriately detained and treated in subsurface facilities. 
(6)  Sufficiency of land area: 
(a)  Better: The site accommodates the scale of the proposed project and minimizes adverse impacts to adjacent parcels and surrounding area through sensitive siting, building design, and landscaping. 
(b)  Best: The site is of sufficient size to accommodate the scale of the proposed project while avoiding adverse impacts to adjacent parcels and surrounding area. 
(7)  Water setbacks: 
(a)  Better: The required gulf and pass waterfront yards are met without departures. 
(b)  Best: The required gulf and pass waterfront yards are exceeded. 
(8)  Zoning compliance: 
(a)  Better: Meets current zoning constraints with minimal departures. 
(b)  Best: Meets current zoning constraints without departures. 
(F)  Approval process. The additional tourism units requested in the final site plan or binding concept plan shall be committed by the town upon the plan's approval, subject to the conditions below: 
(1)  When additional tourism units have been approved through approval of an ODP and binding concept plan, the applicant shall have no more than six months for the town to receive a complete application for final site plan approval. Failure to submit a complete application within six months, or submitting a complete site plan application within six months that is denied after all appeals are exhausted, shall result in the loss of the tourism units committed to the project, and the units shall become available for other proposed developments within the town. 
(2)  Final site plan approval for the construction of additional tourism units shall expire 24 months after the date of approval if a complete application for building permit has not been submitted to the town and a building permit issued for the construction of all buildings that include tourism units. Allocated tourism units associated with an expired final site plan or an expired building permit shall become available for other proposed developments within the town. 
(3)  Concurrent review and approval of an ODP and final site plan is allowed; the final site plan replaces the requirement for a binding concept plan. 
(4)  Concurrent review and approval of applications for involuntary or voluntary rebuild, in accordance with sections 158.139 and 158.140, and applications for up to 250 tourism units, under this section, is allowed and shall be by ODP application in conjunction with a final site plan. The final site plan replaces the requirement for a binding concept plan.

(D)  Priority determination. If the proposed personal wireless service facility is not one of the three highest priorities listed, a detailed explanation and technical justification shall be provided as to why each of the higher priority facilities was not selected. This must include documentation that any existing personal wireless service facility (whether owned by the applicant or not) located within a two-mile radius of the proposed location is physically and/or technically unable to support collocation of additional personal wireless service equipment, that the existing facility is insufficient, or that the existing facility does not meet the engineering requirements of the applicant. 
(E)  Generally applicable review procedures and timeframes. 
(1)  The planning and zoning official shall notify the applicant for a personal wireless service facility within 20 days after the date the application is submitted as to whether the application is, for administrative purposes only, properly completed and has been properly submitted in accordance with the requirements of this Zoning Code. An application for personal wireless service facility is deemed properly completed and properly submitted when it is verified that the information contained within the application is true, accurate, and contains all applicable information needed to make a determination as to the merits of the request. Such notification shall indicate with specificity any deficiencies which, if cured, could make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of information to cure the stated deficiencies, the town shall again have 20 days to notify the applicant, in writing, of any remaining deficiencies that must be cured. If the applicant does not cure the deficiencies within 30 days, the application shall be considered withdrawn and closed. 
(2)  An application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is received by the town. If the town does not notify the applicant in writing that the application is not completed in compliance with this Zoning Code within 20 days after the date the application is initially submitted or resubmitted, the application is deemed, for administrative purposes only, to be properly completed and properly submitted. 
(3)  Applications for a co-location shall be processed within 45 days after an application has been properly completed and properly submitted. Applications for new personal wireless service facilities, including freestanding facilities, shall be processed within 90 days after an application has been properly completed and properly submitted. 
(4)  The timeframes stated in this subsection may be extended or tolled by mutual agreement of the town and applicant.

(6)  Applications must demonstrate that no portion of any abutting, adjoining, or nearby residentially zoned property will be exposed to radio frequency (RF) emissions exceeding the federal safety limits for RF emissions. Once installation has been completed for any personal wireless service facility, a post-construction RF energy testing study must be conducted and submitted to the town demonstrating that the personal wireless service facility complies with this provision and all federal safety standards for RF energy exposure. 
(F)  Variances, waivers and departures. Variances, waivers, departures or other methods of relief from the provisions of the Code shall not be granted for personal wireless service facilities. 
(G)  During a declared emergency within the town, the town manager is authorized to allow the placement and operation of temporary personal wireless service facilities within any zoning district for a period not to exceed 90 days. Placement and operation of temporary personal wireless service facilities beyond the 90-day limit may be granted by the town commission if deemed necessary for the health, safety, and welfare of the public due to extended disruption in services after a declared emergency.

10.02 Transportation proportionate fair-share program 
(A) Purpose and Intent. The purpose of the Town of Longboat Key Transportation Proportionate Fair-Share Program is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16), as may be amended. The town finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and that the Town of Longboat Key Proportionate Fair-Share Program: 
(1) Provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors; 
(2) Allows developers to proceed with site plan or development plan approval under certain conditions, notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency, by contributing their proportionate fair-share of the cost of a transportation facility; 
(3) Contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, thereby, reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion; 
(4) Maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth, and may, in certain circumstances, allow the Town of Longboat Key to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the town's comprehensive plan capital improvement element (CIE); and 
(5) Is consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16), as may be amended, and supports the policies in the Town of Longboat Key Comprehensive Plan. 
(B) Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all proposed developments in the Town of Longboat Key that are determined to lack the capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the Town of Longboat Key transportation network, including transportation facilities maintained by another jurisdiction or Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) that are relied upon for concurrency determinations, pursuant to the requirements of subsection (C) The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in F.S. § 163.3180, as may be amended, and section 158.102 of the Town of Longboat Key Zoning Code. 
(C) Transportation Concurrency Determination. All developments requiring site plan or outline development plan approval and that are not exempted from transportation concurrency, as determined under subsection (B) of this section, shall submit a traffic impact analysis to ensure that the adopted LOS standards are not exceeded. The traffic impact analysis shall determine if a transportation impact study is required under subsection 158.102(E)(1)(a) of the Town Zoning Code. The town shall determine the transportation capacity requirements before an application for site plan or development plan will be accepted by the town. 
(D) Transportation Impact Study. Upon a determination by the town that a transportation impact study is required in accordance with subsections 158.102(E)(1) through (4), the study shall state what improvements are necessary to satisfy the transportation impacts under subsection 158.102(E)(5) and to bring the transportation network into compliance with the designated LOS. The town shall have the opportunity to review the transportation impact study findings to determine whether the necessary improvements are sufficient and are funded in full before an applicant will be allowed to schedule the initial pre-application meeting required under section 158.098. The town may require verification that the findings of the traffic impact study continue to be valid throughout the site plan or development plan approval process, which may require an adjustment to the improvements necessary to maintain the designated LOS. 
(E) Application Process for a Proportionate Fair-Share Agreement. 
(1) Upon determination under subsection (D) of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency and of a lack of funding for the necessary improvements to maintain, at a minimum, the required LOS, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program. 
(2) Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement), a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the strategic intermodal system (SIS), or if impacted facilities are anticipated to be located within the jurisdiction of another local government, then the FDOT or appropriate local government will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. 
(3) Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the Town of Longboat Key that includes an application fee as established by resolution and the following: 
(a) Name, address and phone number of owner(s), developer and agent; 
(b) Property location (physical address), including parcel identification numbers; 
(c) Legal description and survey of property; 
(d) Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development; 
(e) Phasing schedule, if applicable; and 
(f) Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s). 
(4) The town manager or his designee shall review the application for completeness and notify the applicant in writing of the completeness determination. If an application is determined to be incomplete with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program as indicated in subsection (E)(3), the applicant will be notified of the reasons for such deficiencies. 
(5) Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), as may be amended, proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrence of the FDOT. The applicant shall submit evidence of a written agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(6) When an application is deemed complete and eligible, a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the Town of Longboat Key, or by the applicant with direction from the Town of Longboat Key, and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a SIS facility. 
(7) The Town of Longboat Key shall notify the applicant regarding the dates of the Longboat Key Town Commission meetings when the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the Longboat Key Town Commission. 
(F) General Requirements. 
(1) An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the Town of Longboat Key by making a proportionate fair share contribution, pursuant to the following: 
(a) Transportation facilities identified as mitigation for the traffic impact of the proposed development are specifically identified in the five-year schedule of capital improvements contained in the CIE; and, the completion of such facilities will enable the adopted level of service to be achieved; or 
(b) The transportation facilities identified as mitigation for the traffic impacts of the proposed development are not specifically identified in the five-year schedule of capital improvements contained in the CIE of the Town of Longboat Key Comprehensive Plan. 
(2) The Town of Longboat Key may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the concurrency requirements of the Town of Longboat Key transportation network, but is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE, where the following apply: 
(a) The Town of Longboat Key, at its sole discretion, adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE no later than the next regularly scheduled update. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the Town of Longboat Key, and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(b)(1), as may be amended, consistent with the comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this section. Financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions, payments, or other funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities. 
(b) If the funds allocated for the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the Town of Longboat Key CIE are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required to achieve concurrency, the Town of Longboat Key may still enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair share component must be adopted into the five-year capital improvements schedule of the comprehensive plan or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term concurrency management system at the next annual capital improvements element update. 
(3) In addition to meeting the requirements of either subsections (F)(2)(a) or (F)(2)(b), above, applicants must also meet the following requirement: 
(a) The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations; 
(b) The proportionate fair-share development must be accepted and executed by the town and all other necessary parties before the proposed development plan or site plan will be approved; 
(c) Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the Town of Longboat Key for locally maintained roadways and those of the FDOT for the state highway system. 
(G) Intergovernmental Coordination. Sometimes development occurring within the town limits will impact transportation facilities maintained by another government entity, such as FDOT, Sarasota County, City of Sarasota, City of Bradenton, Manatee County, and the jurisdictional governments of Anna Maria Island. Such facilities may be located inside or outside of the town limits. Therefore, the town will continue to coordinate with other affected jurisdictions regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. Pursuant to this, a mutually acceptable interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions to address the cross-jurisdictional impacts of developments on transportation and roadway facilities. 
(H) Determination of Proportionate Fair-Share Obligation. 
(1) Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(2) A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(3) The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS.  
This formula may be stated alternatively as: 
Proportionate Fair Share = ?[[(Development Trips;sub \sub;)/(SV Increase;sub \sub;)] x Cost;sub \sub;] 
Where: 
Development Trips;sub \sub;= Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per concurrency requirements; 
SV Increase;sub \sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per subsection (D); 
Cost;sub \sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i." Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
(4) For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the Town of Longboat Key shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIE, the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)/Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) or the FDOT Work Program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
(a) An analysis by the Town of Longboat Key of costs by cross-section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the Longboat Key Town Commission. In order to accommodate increases in construction material costs, project costs shall be adjusted by the Engineering News Record (ENR) Construction Index; or 
(b) The most recent issue of FDOT transportation costs, as adjusted based upon the type of cross-section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and, significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT work program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the FDOT district. 
(5) If the Town of Longboat Key has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(6) If the Town of Longboat Key has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at the most recent assessed value by the Manatee or Sarasota County Property Appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the Town of Longboat Key and at no expense to the Town of Longboat Key. The applicant shall supply a sketch and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the Town of Longboat Key at no expense to the Town of Longboat Key. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the Town of Longboat Key estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. Prior to purchase or acquisition of any real estate or acceptance of donations of real estate intended to be used for proportionate fair-share, public or private partners shall contact the FDOT for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
(I) Impact Fee Credit for Proportionate Fair Share Mitigation. Proportionate fair-share payments, dedication of rights-of-way accepted as proportionate fair-share payment, and developer-constructed improvements accepted as proportionate fair-share payment shall be eligible for road impact fee credits to the extent consistent with the provisions of the applicable interlocal agreement between the Town of Longboat Key and the impacted adjacent governmental entities. The terms of the impact fee credit may be established in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(J) Proportionate Fair-Share Agreements. 
(1) Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share development agreement, the applicant shall receive a Town of Longboat Key certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within 12 months of the execution of the agreement, then the agreement shall be considered null and void and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
(2) Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full before application for building permits will be allowed and shall be nonrefundable. If the payment is submitted more than 12 months after the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to subsection (H) and adjusted accordingly. 
(3) All developer improvements authorized under this section must be completed prior to the approval of a site plan order or outline development plan, or as otherwise secured in a binding agreement that is accompanied by the appropriate bond instrument(s) that is sufficient to insure the completion of all required improvements. 
(4) Dedication of necessary rights-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat. 
(5) Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(6) Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the Town of Longboat Key will be nonrefundable. 
(7) The Town of Longboat Key may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(K) Appropriation of fair-Share Revenues. 
(1) Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the Town of Longboat Key CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the discretion of the local government, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project for which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program (TRIP). 
(2) In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of subsection (H). 
(3) Where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation calculated under section (H), the Town of Longboat Key shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using one or more of the following methods: 
(a) An impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution, a portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the Town of Longboat Key. 
(b) An account may be established for the applicant for the purpose of reimbursing the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fair-share payments from future applicants on the facility. 
(c) The Town of Longboat Key may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution through payment or some combination of means acceptable to the Town of Longboat Key and the applicant. 
(L) Cross Jurisdictional Impacts. 
(1) A development application submitted to the Town of Longboat Key that has been determined to use 75 p.m. peak hour trips or more on Gulf of Mexico Drive shall be subject to this section. 
(2) Where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in F.S. § 339.155, as may be amended, the Town of Longboat Key may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the FDOT TRIP. Such coordination shall be ratified by the Town of Longboat Key through an interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking of the developer contributions for this purpose. 
(3) In the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency, the Town of Longboat Key may enter an agreement with one or more adjacent local governments to address cross jurisdictional impacts of development on regional transportation facilities. The agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this section to address the cross jurisdictional transportation impacts of development. 
(4) Upon identification of an impacted regional facility pursuant to subsection (L)(2), the Town of Longboat Key shall notify the applicant and the affected adjacent local government in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fair-share contribution, based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility. 
(a) The adjacent local government shall have up to 90 days from the date of the notice in which to notify the Town of Longboat Key of a proposed specific proportionate fair-share obligation, and the intended use of the funds when received. The adjacent local government must provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of F.S. § 163.3180(16), as may be amended. Should the adjacent local government decline proportionate fair-share mitigation under this section, then the provisions of this section would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair-share requirements of the Town of Longboat Key. 
(b) If the subject application is subsequently approved by the Town of Longboat Key, the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides, prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application, evidence that the proportionate fair-share obligation to the adjacent local government has been satisfied. The Town of Longboat Key may require the adjacent local government to declare, in a resolution, ordinance, or equivalent document, its intent for the use of the concurrency funds to be paid by the applicant.

11.02 School concurrency proportionate-share mitigation program 
(A)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of the Town of Longboat Key School Concurrency Proportionate-Share Mitigation Program is to establish a method whereby the impacts of residential development on public school facilities of Manatee or Sarasota County can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate-share program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(13), as amended. The town shall find and determine that adequate school capacity has a value to both the public and private sectors. The town's proportionate-share program: 
(1)  Allows developers to proceed with final plat or site plan approval under certain conditions, notwithstanding the lack of public school capacity, by contributing their proportionate-share to resolve deficiencies in school capacity; 
(2)  Contributes to the provision of adequate public school facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, thereby, reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of student capacity; 
(3)  Maximizes the use of public funds for adequate public school facilities to serve future growth; and 
(4)  Is consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(13), as amended, and supports the policies in the Town of Longboat Key Comprehensive Plan. 
(B)  Applicability. The proportionate-share mitigation program shall apply to all proposed residential developments in the town that are determined to lack the necessary public school capacity in the applicable service area or the adjacent service area. The proportionate-share mitigation program does not apply to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in F.S. § 163.3180, as amended, or exempted under the interlocal agreement for public school facility planning (ILA) for the applicable county. 
(C)  Public school facility concurrency determination. All residential developments requiring final subdivision or site plan approval and that are not exempted from school facility planning concurrency, as determined under subsection (B) of this section, shall submit a school facility planning concurrency analysis from the applicable county school district to ensure that adequate public school capacity is available for the proposed residential development. The applicable county school district shall provide the applicant with a written determination of available capacity. The town shall receive the school district's written determination as part of the application for final subdivision or site plan approval. 
(D)  Application process for a proportionate-share mitigation program. 
(1)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(13), as amended, proposed proportionate-share mitigation for residential development impacts to public school facilities on the school district's capital improvement plan requires the concurrence of the school district. 
(2)  General requirements. Upon a written determination under subsection (C) of a lack of capacity to satisfy school concurrency and of a lack of funding for the necessary improvements to maintain, at a minimum, the required level of service (LOS), the school district shall notify the applicant in writing of the opportunity to satisfy school concurrency through the proportionate-share mitigation program. 
(3)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the school concurrency requirements of the town through proportionate-share mitigation to the affected school district by entering into a development agreement with the school district, the town, and all other affected parties, pursuant to the provisions of the ILA for school facility planning of the county in which the proposed development is located. 
(4)  The town manager or his designee shall review the development agreement for completeness in accordance with section 158.018, (development agreements). If an agreement is determined to be incomplete the town will notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies. 
(5)  When an application for approval of a development agreement is deemed complete the town shall notify the applicant and school district regarding the dates of the public hearings when the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate-share developer agreement will be effective until approved by the town commission. 
(E)  Proportionate-share obligation. 
(1)  Proportionate-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities as stipulated in the ILA for the applicable county. 
(2)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate-share. The fair market value of the proportionate-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(F)  Impact fee credit for proportionate-share mitigation. Proportionate-share payments, dedication of rights-of-way accepted as proportionate-share payment, developer-constructed improvements, and other forms of mitigation accepted as a proportionate-share mitigation payment authorized under F.S. ch. 163, as amended, shall be eligible for school impact fee credits to the extent consistent with the provisions of the applicable ILA between the town, the school district, and impacted adjacent governmental entities. The terms of the impact fee credit may be established in the proportionate-share mitigation agreement. 
(G)  Proportionate-share mitigation agreements. 
(1)  Upon execution of a proportionate-share development agreement, should the applicant fail to apply for a final subdivision or final site plan approval as specified in the applicable interlocal agreement, then the development agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
(2)  Payment of a proportionate-share contribution is due as provided for in the applicable ILA. 
(3)  All developer improvements authorized under this section must be completed prior to the approval of a site plan order or outline development plan, or as otherwise secured in a binding agreement that is accompanied by the appropriate bond instrument(s) that is sufficient to insure the completion of all required improvements. 
(4)  Any requested change to a residential development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate-share contributions to the extent the change would generate the need for additional student stations or school facility improvements that would require mitigation. 
(5)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the town will be nonrefundable. 
(6)  The town and applicable school district may enter into proportionate-share mitigation agreements for selected public school facilities to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared school facility. 
(H)  Intergovernmental coordination. Residential development occurring within the town limits may impact public school facilities or ancillary improvements related to public school facilities maintained by another government entity. Such facilities may be located inside or outside of the town limits. Therefore, the town will continue to coordinate with other affected jurisdictions regarding mitigation to impacted public school facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate-share mitigation.

(Ord. 06-30, passed 1-8-07) 
159.07 - Post-disaster debris clearance and disposal strategies. 
(A)  Intent and purpose. After a disaster, the primary mission of the town will be to clear public streets, restore governmental services, and protect lives and property. Owing to the magnitude of the disaster and after accomplishment of the primary mission, resources may be available to the town that may not be available to the private property owner. The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a process by which the town may evaluate and, if necessary, remove or relocate debris from along the curb of privately owned streets, roads, roadways and other private property in the event of an immediate threat to life, public health, safety and welfare after a significant disaster. While the town recognizes that, as a general proposition, the removal of debris from private property is the responsibility of the private property owner, there are occasions when, because of the magnitude of the disaster and the threat posed to life, health, safety and welfare, there may be a compelling need to remove debris from private streets, roads, and roadways as well as other private property as described in this chapter. 
(B)  Access to property. Access to the properties indicated with a red star on the maps entitled "Town of Longboat Key Debris Management" and on file in the town clerk's office, referred to herein as "exhibit A", shall be provided if: 
(1)  The town is undertaking to clear and push debris in accordance with subsection 159.07(F); and 
(2)  It is reasonably possible with respect to the equipment being used to provide access under the circumstances. 
(C)  Private roadways. The town shall remove debris from private roadways when such debris is determined to be a public nuisance that poses an immediate threat and imperils the health, safety and welfare of the community. The town manager shall determine whether there is a sufficient immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare in accordance with any one of the following standards: 
(1)  Whether there is a significant likelihood that police, fire, emergency, or rescue vehicles will be significantly hindered from rendering emergency services to residential and commercial property should the debris be allowed to remain in place absent town removal. 
(2)  The type of debris is such that it may reasonably cause illness, sickness or disease, which could injure or adversely affect the health, safety, or general welfare of those residing and working in the area if it is allowed to remain. 
(3)  The clearing is necessary to effectuate orderly and expeditious restoration of island-wide power, water, sewer, telephone and other utilities. 
(4)  The debris is determined by the town fire marshal to be dangerous or hazardous. 
(5)  The debris prevents garbage collection thereby creating a public health hazard. 
(6)  The debris contains contaminants that have a reasonable likelihood of leeching into the soil and/or aquifer of the town. 
(7)  The debris has a substantially negative impact in preventing or adversely affecting emergency repairs to buildings and/or property. 
(8)  The debris presents a reasonable danger of being transported by wind and/or water into the surrounding waters of the town and thereby increasing the cost of recovery and removal. 
(9)  The debris poses a significant likelihood that, if left over time, would produce mold that would be injurious to public health. 
(10)  The presence of the debris significantly adversely impacts the town's recovery efforts. 
(11)  The debris significantly interferes with drainage or water runoff, so as to be a significant hazard in the event of significant rainfall. 
(12)  The sheer volume of the debris is such that it is impractical and unreasonable to remove in an orderly and efficient manner absent action by the town. 
(13)  The type, extent and nature of the debris is such that it would cause much greater damage if the debris was not removed prior to another significant storm event. 
(14)  Commercial or other specific areas will be cleared if, in the opinion of the town manager, the clearance will significantly and substantially aid the town's recovery operations or significantly and substantially aid the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the town. 
(D)  Waiver. The above criteria for town action may be waived owing to the severity of the situation by the Florida Long-Term Recovery Office Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(E)  Indemnify and hold harmless. When the town performs the removal of debris as contemplated herein on private roads and private property, or clears private property as provided herein, the private property owner shall indemnify and hold harmless to the maximum extent provided by law, the federal, state and local government and all contractors, employees, officers and agents of the town, connected with the rendering of such service. 
(F)  Emergency roadway clearance. Nothing herein shall preclude a first response by the town to clear and push debris from all roadways (both public and private) including access properties necessary for the movement of emergency vehicles including police, fire and ambulance within the first 70 hours after gaining access to the town after a disaster declaration, or such other extended period authorized by appropriate state, federal or local authorities. 
(G)  Private property. Nothing herein shall require the town to remove debris from private property other than the private roadways identified above, except where the severity of the situation is of such magnitude or the debris is so widespread that it is determined by the town commission, after consulting with FEMA, to be a significant immediate serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare of the town and in the overriding public interest of the town to remove debris from such areas. 
(Ord. 06-30, passed 1-8-07) 
159.08 - Determination of damage. 
(A)  The primary task of the local damage assessment team is to identify structures that have been damaged as a result of the disaster. The town damage assessment team will catalogue and report to the building official those structures that have: 
(1)  Been destroyed; 
(2)  Received major damage; and 
(3)  Received minor damage. 
(B)  The building official will then, as may be necessary, inspect the damaged structures and place each structure in one of the damage categories provided for by this article. The assessment will also serve as a basis for determining if federal and state disaster declarations are warranted. 
(Ord. 06-30, passed 1-8-07) 
159.09 - Moratoria. 
(A)  Conditions for declaration. The town commission may, pursuant to F.S. ch. 252, declare a moratorium under the following conditions in order to prioritize the repair and reconstruction of damaged critical public facilities immediately needed for public health, safety and welfare purposes:
