The City will adhere to all applicable Federal and State laws, regulations and guidelines with respect to providing reasonable modifications, as necessary, to afford disabled persons equal access to City programs and services, and to modify City employment, building, and zoning rules, regulations, practices, and standards when necessary. Questions regarding reasonable modification and/or discrimination on the basis of disability should be directed to the City's ADA Coordinator.  A notification of this policy shall be on display at City Hall/Planning Department to alert people that this policy exists and that a copy of this policy will be made available by the City upon request. 

 

            The City shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the City can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, activity, regulation or policy being modified, or result in an undue financial or administrative burden.

 

            The City shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communication with applicants, participants, and members of the public with disabilities are as effective as communications with others. To this end, the City shall furnish upon request appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity conducted by the City. In determining what type of auxiliary aid or service is necessary, the City shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with a disability.

 

            The City recognizes that providing services in an integrated setting through architectural barrier removal is the most desirable method to provide equally effective opportunities and benefits for many individuals with disabilities.

 

            The City is not required to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, activity or regulations, or any action that would result in undue financial or administrative burdens. Any determination that a modification in its policies or procedures to provide an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity for individuals with disabilities would fundamentally alter the service, program, or activity or unduly burden the City shall be made by the City ADA Coordinator after consulting with the City Attorney and after considering all resources available for use in funding and operating the program, service, or activity. The decision shall be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that determination.

 

            When barrier removal is "technically infeasible" or when reasonable modification would result in "undue financial or administrative burden" or "fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity," the procedures in this policy will help ensure that the City adheres to the requirements of the ADA regulations and guidelines with respect to burden and infeasibility.

            Sec. 1-8.03            Definitions.
 

            "Auxiliary aids and services" shall mean and include:

 

(a)        Qualified interpreters, note takers, transcription services, written materials, assistive listening systems, and other effective methods for making aurally delivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments,

 

(b)        Qualified readers, taped texts, audio recordings, Braille materials, large print materials, or other effective methods for making visually delivered materials available to individuals with visual impairments,

 

(c)        Acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, and

 

(d)       Other similar services and actions.

 

            "Disability" As defined by the ADA at 42 U.S.C. § 12102 and with respect to an individual shall mean (a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual, (b) a record of such impairment, or (c) being regarded as having such an impairment.

 

            "Qualified individual with a disability" shall mean an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services, the participation in programs or activities provided by the City, or is subject to the laws, rules and regulations of the City.

 

            "Reasonable modification" shall mean modifications or adjustments to a program, service, legal requirements and statutes or activity that will enable equal access, to the maximum extent possible, for qualified individuals with a disability.

 

            "Technically infeasible" With respect to an alteration of a building or a facility, technically infeasible is something that has little likelihood of being accomplished because existing structural conditions would require removing or altering a load-bearing member that is an essential part of the structural frame; or because other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features that are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements.

 

            "Undue burden" shall mean significant difficulty or expense. In determining whether an action would result in an undue burden, the City shall consider all City resources available to the program or component for which the product is being developed, procured, maintained, or used or entitlements, approvals or permits sought.

(a)        The City will make all reasonable modifications to policies and programs to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to enjoy all of its programs, services, and activities, and will permit exceptions to stated local zoning, vehicle, parking, building, and employment standards, requirements, and practices when necessary and reasonable to ensure equal opportunity.

 

(b)        Any disabled person, his or her representative, or any developer or provider of housing for one or more people with a disability may request an accommodation from any of the City's rules, policies, practices, and/or procedures when such accommodation is reasonable and necessary to afford such persons equal opportunity and access as citizens who are not disabled.

 

(c)        Anyone who requires an auxiliary aid or service for effective communication, or a modification of policies or procedures to participate in a program, service, or activity of the City, should contact the ADA Coordinator, as soon as possible but no later than forty-eight (48) hours before the scheduled event. Please include the name, location and date of the service or program, and your contact information. While requests for auxiliary aids or services can usually be accommodated with limited notice, please be advised that other requests for accommodation, including but not limited to requests for exceptions to local zoning and buildings standards, regulations, and practices will require the completion of a request for accommodation application.

 

(d)       The City will generally, upon request, provide appropriate aids and services leading to effective communication for qualified persons with disabilities so they can participate equally in the City's programs, services, and activities, including qualified sign language interpreters, documents in Braille, and other ways of making information and communications accessible to people who have speech, hearing, or vision impairments. Requests for aids or services for effective communication should be directed to the ADA Coordinator, with as much advance notice as practicable.

 

(e)        In the provision of auxiliary aids or services, including modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, the City will not place surcharges on individuals with disabilities to cover the costs involved in making programs, services or activities accessible.

 

(f)        City facilities are either fully structurally accessible to individuals with disabilities or will be made fully accessible. Should any facility not be fully accessible, all services normally provided to the public at that location will be provided at a fully accessible location upon request.

 

(g)        In cases of emergency services, which are unplanned and may require complex and important communication, interpretation services consistent with the requirements of the ADA will be arranged to the extent practicable.

 

(h)        If the reasonable accommodation involves deviation from the City's vehicle standards, the request shall be heard by the Vehicle Hearing Officer or his or her designee, subject to all applicable regulations for notice, determination and appeal.

 

(i)         If the reasonable accommodation involves deviation from the City's building standards or zoning regulations, the request shall be heard by the Planning Commissioner or his or her designee, subject to all applicable regulations for notice, determination and appeal.

 

(j)         The City's ADA Coordinator shall coordinate the City's efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title II of the ADA and applicable State law, including investigation of any complaint communicated to the City alleging its noncompliance or alleging any actions that are prohibited under the ADA. The City shall make available to all interested individuals the name, office address, telephone number, and email of the ADA Coordinator and shall provide for procedures for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action that is prohibited under the ADA. Complaints that a program, service, or activity of the City is not accessible to persons with disabilities should be directed to the ADA Coordinator.

(4)        The rule, regulation, policy, practice, or procedure of the City for which the request for accommodation is being made;

 

(5)        If applicable the specific event of the City for which the request for accommodation is being made;

            Sec. 1-8.06            Criteria for Granting Accommodation.
 

(a)        Auxiliary Aids and Services. Requests for auxiliary aids and services may be approved without findings or written conclusions by the ADA Coordinator, or his or her representatives.

 

(b)        Findings. For all other types of requests for accommodation, including but not limited to those requesting exceptions to stated zoning, building, vehicle and employment rules, regulations, practices, and procedures, the following findings shall be analyzed, made, and adopted before any action is taken to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a request for accommodation, and must be incorporated into the record of the proceeding relating to such decisions:

 

(1)        Whether the request for accommodation is reasonable and necessary to afford the applicant with equal opportunities as citizens who are not disabled;

 

(2)        Whether there are preferable and feasible alternatives to the requested accommodation that may provide an equivalent level of benefit;

 

(3)        The physical attributes of any proposed changes to properties and structures;

 

(4)        Whether the requested accommodation will require a fundamental alteration of the City's rules, regulations, policies, practices, or procedures;

 

(5)        Whether the requested accommodation will result in an undue financial or administrative burden to the City;

 

(6)        If zoning related, whether the requested accommodation would result in a detriment to the character of the neighborhood;

 

(7)        Whether the requested accommodation, under the specific circumstances, will result in a direct and significant threat to the health or safety of other individuals or property; and

 

(8)        Any other factors that may have bearing on the request.

 

(c)        Conditions of Approval. Any modification granted for an individual with a disability may be considered a personal accommodation for the individual applicant, and may not run with the land. The conditions of approval may, where deemed appropriate, provide for any or all of the following:

 

(1)        Periodic inspection of the affected premises, as specified in the conditions, to verify compliance with this section and with any other applicable conditions of approval.

 

(2)        Prior to any transfer of interest in the premises, notice to the transferee of the existence of the modification, the personal status of the modification and the requirement that the transferee apply for a new modification, if necessary.

 

(3)        Removal of the improvements, where removal would not constitute an unreasonable and unfair financial burden, if the need for which the accommodation was granted no longer exists.

 

(4)        Time limits and/or expiration of the approval if the need for which the accommodation was granted no longer exists.

 

(5)        Other conditions deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

 

(d)       Notice of Determination. When practical, the Planning Commissioner, Vehicle Code Officer, or the ADA Coordinator or his or her representative, as applicable, shall issue a written notice of decision within thirty (30) days of the submittal of the completed application or hearing, as the case may be. The decision shall grant the request, grant the request with conditions, deny the request, or offer approval of an alternative accommodation. The request shall be denied if the result of granting the request would lead to a violation of Federal or State law. The notice shall contain the factual findings, conclusions, and reasons for the decision and give notice of the right to appeal as set forth in Section 1-8.07 of this chapter. The notice shall be mailed to the applicant by certified mail to the address listed on the application for the request.

The City Council may not offer an accommodation more restrictive than what was originally offered. In reaching its decision, the City Council should consider the factors outlined in Section 1-8.06(b) of this chapter.  Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the applicant from any other State or Federal remedy available to applicant.

            (c)        The applicant has knowingly made a false statement on a material matter in the application or in testimony at any hearing on the application, and it is therefore in the public interest that the license not be granted.

 

            In granting any license, the Director of Finance may, in the application of the standards stated herein and in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, impose reasonable conditions pertaining to the conduct of the business licensed, in addition to, but not limited by, the regulations contained in this chapter.

            All matters pertaining to revocation or suspension shall be referred by the Director of Finance to the City Council, with a written statement of the reasons for the proposed revoca­tion or suspension.

The notice shall state the grounds for the complaint or rea­sons for the proposed revocation or suspension in clear and concise language. The notice shall be served upon the licensee personally or by mail not less than ten (10) and not more than twenty (20) days prior to the hearing date. At the hearing, the licensee shall be given the op­portunity to appear personally or through counsel, to be heard, to defend the charges and to call witnesses. Upon good cause shown, the licensee shall be entitled to a continuance until the next meeting of the City Council.

            (a)        Intent. In enacting the provisions of Article 2, the City Council has established taxes based upon reasonable classifications. The tax schedule and procedure has been pre­pared on the basis of an occurrence of a taxable event within the City, and it is only taxable events within the City that are subject to taxation.

Such events include, but are not limited to, manufacturing, construction, services, selling, deliver­ies, and similar activities.

 

            (b)        Inter-City Transportation Business. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to levy a business license tax in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Consti­tution, including, but not limited to, levies upon a person or corporation not having a fixed place of business within the City, and engaged in the business of transporting goods, wares or merchandise through the City where both the point of origin and destination are outside the City's boundaries.

            (a)        Verified Statements Required. Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to the provisions of this section shall file a verified statement with the City Clerk stating the facts upon which such exemption is claimed.

 

            (b)        Issuance of Licenses. The City Clerk, upon a proper showing contained in the verified statement, shall issue a license to such person claiming an exemption without payment to the City of the license tax required by the provisions of this chapter.

 

            (c)        Revocation of Licenses. The City Clerk, after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity for a hearing to a licensee, may revoke any license granted pursuant to the provi­sions of this section upon information that the licensee is not entitled to the exemption provided for in this section.

 

            (d)       Federal and State Exempted Businesses. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to apply to any person transacting and carrying on any business exempt by virtue of the constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of the State from the payment of such taxes as are prescribed in this chapter.

 

            (e)        Interstate Commerce. None of the license taxes provided for by this chapter shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce. In any case where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an undue burden upon such commerce, he may apply to the City Clerk for an adjustment of the tax so that it shall not be discriminatory or unreasonable as to such commerce. Such application may be made before, at, or within six (6) months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by affidavit and supporting testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the City Clerk may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden on such commerce. The City Clerk shall then conduct an investigation and, after having first ob­tained the written approval of the City Attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory or, if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the City Clerk shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this chapter. Should the City Clerk determine the gross receipts measure of license tax to be the proper basis, he may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of the applicant's business in the City or at the end of each three (3) month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of li­cense tax therefor; provided, however, no additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in this chapter.

 

            (f)        Charitable and Nonprofit Activities. The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed or construed to require the payment of a license tax to conduct, manage, or carry on any business, occupation, or activity from any institution or organization which is conducted, managed, or carried on wholly for the benefit of charitable purposes or from which profit is not derived, either directly or indirectly, by any individual; nor shall any license tax be required for the conduct of any entertainment, concert, exhibition, or lecture on scientific, historical, lit­eracy, religious, or moral subjects within the City whenever the receipts of any such enter­tainment, concert, exhibition, or lecture are to be appropriated to any church or school or to any religious or benevolent purpose; nor shall any license tax be required for the conduct of any entertainment, dance, concert, exhibition, or lecture by any religious, charitable, fraternal, educational, military, State, County, or municipal organization or association whenever the re­ceipts of any such entertainment, dance, concert, exhibition, or lecture are to be appropriated for the purposes and objects for which such organization or association was formed and from which profit is not derived, either directly or indirectly, by an individual; provided, however, nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to exempt any such organization or associa­tion from complying with any of the provisions of this chapter requiring a permit from the Council or any officer to conduct, manage, or carry on any profession, trade, calling, or occu­pation.

Article 4. Transient Occupancy Tax
 

Sec. 3-3.401   Title of Provisions.
 

            This article shall be known as the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law of the City.

(§1, Ord. 474)

 

Sec. 3-3.402   Definitions.
 

            For the purposes of this article, certain words and phrases used herein are defined as follows:

 

            (a)        "Hotel" shall mean any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied, or intended or designed for occupancy, by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes and shall include any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure, or portion thereof.

 

            (b)        "Occupancy" shall mean the use or possession, or the right to the use or pos-session of any room, or portion thereof, for dwelling, sleeping or lodging purposes. The Director of Finance may from time to time adopt administrative regulations specifying those services, goods, or other benefits related to the use or possession of the room, which are included within the meaning of "occupancy."

 

            (c)        "Operator" shall mean the person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this article and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this article by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

 

            (d)       "Person" shall mean any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

 

            (e)        "Rent" shall mean the consideration charged for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits, property, and services of any kind or nature without deduction therefrom whatsoever. "Rent" includes the consideration charged for occupancy, as defined, regardless of whether named a fee, assessment, service charge, management fee, cleaning fee, or other expense.

 

            (f)        "Tax" shall mean transient occupancy tax.

 

            (g)        "Transient" shall mean any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the provisions of this article may be considered.

(§2, Ord. 474; §§13, Ord. 891-93, eff. February 18, 1993)

 

Sec. 3-3.403   Imposition of Tax.
 

            For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient shall be subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve (12%) percent of the rent charged for such occupancy. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the transient to the City, which debt shall be extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid; however, where the operator blocks a room or rooms at a discounted or wholesale rate to a third party who collects the rent from the transient, then the third party shall pay to the operator the tax on the actual rent paid by the transient to the third party. The third party shall pay the tax based on the rate which the operator would charge a transient if the operator rented the same room or rooms directly to a transient.

            No tax shall be imposed upon:

 

            (a)        Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the City to impose the tax provided for in this article;

 

            (b)        Any Federal or State officer or employee when on official business; or

 

            (c)        Any officer or employee of a foreign government, which officer or employee is exempt by reason of express provisions of Federal laws or international treaties.

Sec. 3-3.405   Operator's Duties.
 

            Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by the provisions of this article to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax, or any part thereof, will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this article.

(§5, Ord. 474)

 

Sec. 3-3.406   Registration and Permit.
 

            Every person desiring to engage in or conduct business as operator of a hotel renting to transients within the City shall file with the Director of Finance an application for a transient occupancy registration permit. Every application for such permit shall be made upon a form prescribed by the Director of Finance and shall set forth the name under which the applicant transacts or intends to transact business, the location of his place of business, the name and address of the property owner if the hotel and/ or land is subject to a lease, and such other information as the Director of Finance may require.

In addition, any corporation registered under the provisions of this chapter shall provide to the Director of Finance a current certified document each year from the Secretary of State listing the officers and agent for service of process of the corporation. Within ten (10) days after change of ownership of the business, the new operator shall file said application.

(§6, Ord. 474; §5, Ord. 891-93, eff. February 18, 1993)

 

Sec. 3-3.407   Reporting and Remitting.
 

            The operator collecting the tran­sient occupancy tax shall make a report upon such forms and setting forth such information as the Finance Director may prescribe and require, including, but not limited to, the total amount of rents charged and collected, the amount of transient occupancy tax collected for the prior month and occupancy data. He shall sign the report under penalty of perjury and deliver the report and tax remittance monthly to the Finance Director on or before the last business day of the month following the reported month. Remittance by check or money order shall be made payable to the City. The Director of Finance may establish shorter reporting periods for any permit holder if he deems it necessary in order to assure collection and remittance of the tax.

(§7, Ord. 474; §6, as amended by Ord. 891-93, eff. February 18, 1993; §2, Ord. 928-96, eff. August 1, 1996)

 

Sec. 3-3.408   Penalties and Interest.
 

            (a)        Original Delinquency. Any operator who shall fail to remit any tax imposed by the provisions of this article within the time required shall pay a penalty in the amount of ten (10%) percent of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. No penalty shall accrue where the regulations in effect at the time the transient's payment was received by the operator did not provide for the application of the tax to such payment or where the operator has obtained a written ruling from the Director of Finance regarding the application of the tax to a particular charge. The Director of Finance shall provide a written ruling within five (5) days of his receipt of a written request for a ruling. The Director of Finance's rulings shall be kept on file by the City's Finance Department in a separate book and shall be made available upon request. The Director of Finance may waive any or all of a penalty imposed where, in his sole discretion, he deems it to be appropriate.

 

            (b)        Continued Delinquency. Any operator who shall fail to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty in the amount of ten (10%) percent of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten (10%) percent penalty first imposed.

 

            (c)        Fraud. If the Director of Finance shall determine that the nonpayment of any remittance due pursuant to the provisions of this article is due to fraud, a penalty in the amount of twenty-five (25%) percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.

 

            (d)       Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who shall fail to remit any tax imposed by the provisions of this article shall pay interest at the rate of one-half (1/2) of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

 

            (e)        Penalties for Failure to Timely File Complete Report. If any person shall fail or refuse to timely file a complete monthly report as required by Section 3-3.407, there shall be a penalty assessed until a complete report is filed, in the amount of Thirty and no/100ths ($30.00) Dollars per month or a prorated portion of the month, in addition to other penalties.

 

            (f)        Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed, and such interest as accrues, pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid by the provisions of this article.

(§8, Ord. 474; as amended by §7, Ord. 891-93, eff. February 18, 1993; §3, Ord. 928-96, eff. August 1, 1996)

 

Sec. 3-3.409   Failure to Collect and Report Tax.
 

            If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this article, any report and remittance of such tax, or any portion thereof, required by the provisions of this article, the Director of Finance shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain the facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Director of Finance shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any such tax imposed and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the Director of Finance shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by the provisions of this article. In the event such determination is made, the Director of Finance shall give notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may, within ten (10) days after the service or mailing of such notice, make an application in writing to the Director of Finance for a hearing on the amount assessed. If an application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any, determined by the Director of Finance shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such an application is made, the Director of Finance shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest, and penalties shall not be so fixed. After such hearing the Director of Finance shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is filed as provided in Section 3-3.410 of this article.

The Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in this article for the service of a notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Director of Finance.

 

            (b)        Any operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Director of Finance that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

 

            (c)        A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Director of Finance, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Director of Finance that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

 

            (d)       No refund shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto.

Any person required to make, render, sign, or verify any report or claim and who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by the provisions of this article to be made shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

Sec. 3-3.415   Revocation of Permit.* 
 

            Whenever an operator fails to comply with any provision of this article relating to transient occupancy taxes or any rule or regulation prescribed by the Director of Finance relating to such tax or registration permit, the Director of Finance shall hold a hearing, after giving the lessor, if applicable and the operator ten (10) days' written notice sent by certified mail specifying the time and place of hearing and requiring the operator to show cause why his permit or permits should not be revoked. After such hearing, the Director of Finance may suspend or revoke any one or more of the permits held by the operator. Within five (5) days after the hearing, the Director of Finance shall give the operator written notice by certified mail of the suspension or revocation of the permit or permits.

 

            The aggrieved operator may appeal the suspension or revocation of the permit or permits to the City Council by filing a notice of appeal in writing with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days after the service or mailing of the notice of suspension or revocation.

            The Director of Finance shall not issue a new permit after revocation or lift a suspension of a permit until the operator has satisfied any outstanding debt to the City under this article, including penalties and interest. Where an operator has failed to timely remit the return or taxes more than two (2) times in any calendar year, whether or not such failure has resulted in a suspended or revoked permit, the Director of Finance may send written notice to the operator requiring that such operator post a bond within fifteen (15) days of such notice, in a form approved by the City Attorney and in an amount equal to the preceding six (6) months taxes collected. The bond shall remain in force until the operator has timely remitted returns and taxes for a continuous period of six (6) months. Thereafter, the bond shall be released. The failure to post the bond within fifteen (15) days after such notice shall constitute a violation of this article.

Sec. 3-3.417   Recording Certificate of Lien.
 

            If any amount required to be remitted or paid to the City under this article is not remitted or paid when due, the Director of Finance may, within three (3) years after the amount is due file for recording with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office a certificate specifying the amount of the tax, penalties and interest due, the name and address as it appears on the registration permit of the operator liable for the amount and the fact that the Director of Finance has complied with all provisions of this article in determining such amount.

            (c)        Liability of Purchaser  Release. If the purchaser of a hotel operator's business fails to withhold part of the purchase price as required, he shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within sixty (60) days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, or within sixty (60) days from the date the former hotel operator's records are made available for audit, whichever period expires later, but in any event not later than ninety (90) days after receiving the request, the Director of Finance shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the Director of Finance of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the Director of Finance to mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold the purchase price as above provided. The time within which the obligation of the successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells his business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs the later.

Sec. 3-3.423   Withhold Notice.
 

            If any person or operator is delinquent in the remittance or payment of the amount required to be remitted or paid by him or in the event a determination has been made against him for the remittance of tax and payment of the penalty, the City may, within three (3) years after the tax obligation became due, give notice thereof personally or by registered mail to all persons including the state or any political subdivision thereof, having in their possession or under their control any credits or other personal property belonging to the taxpayer. After receiving the withholding notice, the person so notified shall make no disposition of the taxpayer's credits, other personal property or debts until the City consents to a transfer or disposition or until sixty (60) days elapse after the receipt of the notice, whichever expires earlier. All persons, upon receipt of said notice, shall advise the City immediately of all such credits, other personal property or debts in their possession, under their control or owing by them. If such notice seeks to prevent the transfer or other disposition of a deposit in a bank or other credits or personal property in the possession or under the control of the bank, to be effective the notice shall be delivered or mailed to the branch or office of such bank at which such deposit is carried or at which such credits or personal property is held. If any person so notified makes transfer or disposition of the property or debts required to be held hereunder during the effective period of the notice to withhold, he shall be liable to the City to the extent of the value of the release up to the amount of the indebtedness owned by the taxpayer to the City.

Sec. 3-3.424   Stacking Prohibited.
 

            It is a violation of this chapter for any person to knowingly aid or engage in the practice commonly known in the lodging industry as "stacking." As used herein, "stacking" occurs when a transient occupant who is the registered occupant of a transient occupancy unit allows other persons to share occupancy of that unit for overnight sleeping on any night for which such other person or persons are not registered. Any transient who allows stacking to take place in the unit for which that person is registered, and any transient who occupies a unit knowing that his or her occupancy has not been reported to the owner or operator or has not been paid for, shall be in violation of this section. Any such violation shall be prosecuted as a misdemeanor, or, in the discretion of the prosecuting attorney, may be prosecuted as an infraction.

 

            (a)        Notice. In order to apprise transient occupants of potential violations of this section, all hotel and other transient occupancy facility operators are encouraged to incorporate language similar to the following in their registration documents:

 

            Your room/unit is to be occupied by not more than            persons. The Avalon Municipal Code prohibits housing additional unregistered guests in a unit.

Any remaining balance shall be applied to taxes due.

 

            (b)        The duty to collect tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first full regular billing period applicable to the service user where charges are subject to the provisions of this article.

            (b)        The Tax Administrator shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with provisions of this article for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of such rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office.

 

            (c)        The Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements to vary the strict requirements of this article so that collection of any tax imposed here may be made in conformance with the billing procedures of a particular service supplier so long as said agreements result in collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this article. A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office.

 

            (d)       The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from the tax imposed by this article. The Tax Administrator shall provide the service supplier with the name of any person who the Tax Administrator determines is exempt from the tax imposed hereby, together with the address and account number to which service is supplied to any such exempt person.

            (b)        Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by such users from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or that a service user has refused to pay the amount of tax to such person, or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it in the best interest of the City, he may relieve such person of the obligation to collect taxes due under this article from certain named service users for specified billing periods.

 

            (c)        The service supplier shall provide the City with amounts refused, along with the names, addresses and reasons of the service users refusing to pay the tax imposed under provisions of this article. Whenever the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, the Tax Administrator may relieve the service supplier of the obligation to collect taxes due.

 

            (d)       The Tax Administrator shall notify the service user that he has assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes. The notice shall be served on the service user by handing it to him personally or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have changed his address, to his last known address. If a service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator within fifteen (15) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him, which shall be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person, a penalty of twenty-five (25%) percent of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed, but not less than Five and no/100ths ($5.00) Dollars.

Sec. 3-3.612   Refunds.
 

            (a)        Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this article it may be refunded as provided in this section.

 

            (b)        Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, a service supplier may, with prior written approval from the Tax Administrator, claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established that the service user from whom the tax has been collected did not owe the tax; provided however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the service user or credited to charges subsequently payable by the service user to the person required to collect and remit. A service supplier that has collected any amount of tax in excess of the amount of tax imposed by this article and actually due from a service user, may refund such amount to the service user and may, with prior written approval of the Tax Administrator, claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly returns, provided such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than three (3) years from the date of overpayment.

 

            (c)        Notwithstanding subsection (b), no person shall be entitled to a refund unless the claimant thereof submits a written claim to the Tax Administrator setting forth the amount of the claim, the dates on which the amount in dispute was collected, and the legal basis for the refund claim no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the service provider's bill which contains the disputed tax.

 

            (d)       Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, whenever a service supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, makes a refund to service users of charges for past utility services, the taxes paid pursuant to this article on the amount of such refunded charges shall also be refunded to service users, and the service supplier may, with prior written approval of the Tax Administrator, take a credit for such refunded taxes against the amount of tax which is due upon the next monthly returns. In the event this article is repealed, the amounts of any refundable taxes will be borne by the City.

(Prior Ordinance History: Ord. 650, Ord. 808, Ord. 834, Ord. 1088-09, Ord. 1126-13)

 

 

Article 1. General
 

            Sec. 3-4.101       Adoption of Purchasing System.
 

            In order to establish efficient procedures for the purchases of services, supplies and equipment, to secure for the City services, supplies and equipment at the lowest possible cost commensurate with quality, to exercise positive financial control over purchases, to clearly define the authority for the purchasing function, and to assure the quality of purchases, a purchasing system is hereby adopted. (Ord. 1165, eff. April 5, 2018)

 

            Sec. 3-4.102    Purchasing Procedures.
 

        Contracts for public projects shall follow the formal contract bid procedure pursuant to Section 3-4.105 of this article.  All other purchases of services, supplies and equipment shall be by competitive process pursuant to Section 3-4.106 of this article. These procedures shall be dispensed with only when the purchasing amount involved is less than five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars for public projects or twenty-five thousand ($25,000.00) dollars for all other purchases, unless an exception applies. As used in this section, public project means (1) a project for the erection, improvement, painting, or repair of public buildings and works; (2) work in or about streams, bays, waterfronts, embankments, or other work for protection against overflow; (3) Street or sewer work except maintenance or repair; or (4) furnishing supplies or materials for any such project, including maintenance or repair of streets or sewers. (Ord. 1165, eff. April 5, 2018)

 

            Sec. 3-4.103        Purchase Orders.
 

       Purchases of services, supplies and equipment greater than one thousand ($1,000) dollars shall be made only by purchase order issued by the City Manager or the City Managers designee. (Ord. 1165, eff. April 5, 2018)

 

            Sec. 3-4.104 Encumbrance of Funds.
 

            Except in the case of emergency, neither the City Manager or the City Managers designee shall issue any purchase order for supplies or equipment unless there exists an unencumbered appropriation in the fund account against which such purchase is to be charged. (Ord. 1165, eff. April 5, 2018)

 

            Sec. 3-4.105           Formal Contract Bid Procedure.
 

            The following formal contract bid procedure shall be used whenever formal bidding is required, including public projects that exceed five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars, and shall be by written contract with the lowest responsible bidder pursuant to the following bid procedures:

 

(a)               Notices Inviting Bids. Notices inviting bids shall include a general description of the articles to be purchased, shall state where bid blanks and specifications may be secured, and the time, date and place for receiving and opening sealed bids and any other information required by state or local law. Such notices shall be published at least ten (10) days before the date of opening the bids in a newspaper of general circulation, printed and published in the City, or if there is none, such notices shall be posted in at least three (3) public places for posting public notices. Notice shall be published at least twice, not less than five (5) days apart. Sealed bids shall also be solicited from all responsible prospective suppliers whose names are on the bidders' list or who request their names to be added thereto.

 

(b)               Bidder's Security. All bids shall be presented under sealed cover accompanied by a form of bidders security as prescribed in the public notices inviting bids in an amount at least equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount bid. Bidders shall be entitled to the return of bid security; provided, however, the successful bidder shall forfeit its bid security upon its refusal or failure to execute the contract within ten (10) days after the notice of the award of contract has been mailed, unless the City is responsible for the delay. The Council, on the refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, may award it to the next lowest responsible bidder. If the Council awards the contract to the next lowest bidder, the amount of the lowest bidder's security shall be applied by the City to the difference between the lowest responsible bid and the second lowest responsible bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest responsible bidder.

 

(c)               Bid Opening Procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the City Manager or the City Managers designee, and shall be identified as bids on the envelope. Bids shall be opened in public at the time, date and place stated in the public notices. A tabulation of all bids received shall be open for public inspection during regular business hours for a period of not less than thirty (30) calendar days after the bid opening.

 

(d)               Rejection of Bids. In its discretion, the Council may reject any and all bids presented and purchase without further bidding, or may re-advertise for bids in the manner prescribed under this section.

 

(e)               Award of Contracts. Contracts shall be awarded by the Council to the lowest responsible bidder, except as otherwise provided in this section.

 

(f)                Tie Bids. If two (2) or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, the Council may accept the bid it chooses or accept the lowest bid made by negotiation with the tie bidders.

 

(g)               Performance Bonds. The Council shall have the authority to require a performance bond before entering into a contract in such amount as the Council shall find reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the City. If the Council requires a performance bond, the form and amount of the bond shall be described in the notice inviting bids.

(Ord. 1165, eff. April 5, 2018)

 

            Sec. 3-4.106   Competitive Process.
 

       Whenever formal bidding is not required and the contract amount is over twenty-five thousand ($25,000.00) dollars, contracts shall be awarded using one of the following competitive procedures:

 

(a)               Vendor Price Quotes. The City Manager or the City Managers designee shall solicit via posted notice, telephone request, mail, email, fax or any other reasonable solicitation method, price quotes in writing from a minimum of three (3) vendors.  If unable to obtain three (3) price quotes, City staff shall document that there were no other companies to solicit price quotes from or that they solicited to other companies and all declined to provide a quote. 

 

(b)               Request for Proposals/Qualifications. The City Manager or the City Managers designee shall solicit via posted notice, telephone request, mail, email, fax or any other reasonable solicitation method, proposals in writing  from a minimum of three (3) firms or from the public at-large.  If unable to obtain three (3) proposals, City staff shall document that there were no other companies to solicit proposals from or that they solicited publicly or to other companies and all declined to provide a proposal.

 

(c)               Best Competitive Value. Best Competitive Value means a value determined by evaluation of criteria that may include, but is not limited to, price, features, functions, life-cycle costs, experience, and past performance.  City shall publish the requirements for vendors that define the terms, conditions, and specifications for services, supplies or equipment required by the city and award the contract to the vendor providing the best competitive value as defined in the solicitation.

 

(d)               Formal Bids.  The City may elect to use the formal bidding procedure contained in Section 3-4.105 for any procurement other than a public project, in which case the contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. 

 

(e)               Small Purchases. Purchases of one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars and less may be made without a formal purchase order by a Department Head of the City or the Department Heads designee.

(Ord. 1165, eff. April 5, 2018)

 

 

            Sec. 3-4.107      Inspection and Testing.
 

            The City Manager or the City Managers designee shall inspect any supplies and equipment delivered to determine their conformance with the specifications set forth in the order or contract.

The City Council may by a four-fifths (4/5) vote approve exceptions to this requirement only after expressly finding that a determination of a "not-to-exceed" price is not feasible. (Ord. 1165, eff. April 5, 2018)

 

            Sec. 3-4.109            Local Vendor Preference; Maintenance and General Services.
 

            As set forth in further detail in Section 3-4.110, the City Council has made findings and adopted a Local Vendor Preference Program (Local Program) applicable to certain purchases of materials, supplies, and equipment, as well as contracts for public works construction, maintenance and general services contracts described in this section. Accordingly, construction, maintenance and general services contracts that follow the Citys formal contract bid procedure or competitive process procedures shall be subject to the Local Program set forth in Section 3-4.110. A properly certified Local Small Businesses (as defined in Section 3-4.110) shall be entitled to the specified reduction of five (5%) percent in the tabulation of its bid for purposes of determining the lowest responsible vendor or proposed price for services or delivery of goods, unless otherwise prohibited by law. This five (5%) percent adjustment shall only apply to local small businesses when such local small businesses are at least equal in responsibility and quality to other businesses bidding on contracts. Such findings shall be made by the City Council when awarding the contract to a local small business. If the Program is applicable to a bid offering, it shall be noted in the applicable bid solicitation. The five (5%) percent preference shall only apply to the determination of the business that is awarded the City contract. The price set forth in the actual bid or quote will be the price set forth in the agreement between the City and the local small business. (Ord. 1165, eff. April 5, 2018)

 

            Sec. 3-4.110            Local Vendor Preference Program; Purchase of Materials, Supplies and Equipment.
 

            Based upon the findings provided for in the recitals of the Ordinance adding this section, the City Council has determined that is in the best interests of the City to give a minimum preference to local small businesses when the City is making certain purchases of materials, supplies, and equipment, as well as when it is entering into contracts for public works construction, maintenance, and general services, as set forth in this Local Vendor Preference Program ("Program").

 

            The Program shall consist of the following general requirements, which shall be implemented by the City Manager:

 

(a)               A local small business for the purposes of this Program shall mean the vendor: (i) has fixed facilities with employees located at a business address within City limits (a post office box or nonbusiness residence alone is insufficient); (ii) has an appropriate City business license/permit (iii) has at least fifty (50%) percent of its fulltime employees residing within City limits; and (iv) has no more than twenty-five (25) employees employed fulltime. A fulltime employee is one who works more than thirty-five (35) hours a week. A vendor seeking to qualify for this Program shall provide supporting information and certify in writing that it meets the above requirements as part of its bid.

 

(b)               In applying the Program to bids on a City purchase subject to the Program, qualifying local small business shall be entitled to a reduction of five (5%) percent in the tabulation of its bid for purposes of determining the lowest responsible bidder or price for comparison to other businesses, unless otherwise prohibited by law (i.e. special State or Federal grant programs). This five (5%) percent adjustment shall only apply to local small businesses when such local small businesses are at least equal in responsibility and quality to other businesses bidding on contracts. Such findings shall be made by the City Council when awarding the contract to a local small business.

 

(c)               The Program shall only be applicable to purchases of materials, supplies and equipment, and contracts for public works construction, maintenance, and general services which are competitively bid. If the Program is applicable to a bid offering, it shall be noted in the applicable bid solicitation.

(Ord. 1165, eff. April 5, 2018)

 

            Sec. 3-4.111     Exceptions from Bidding and Other Competitive Procedures.
 

(a)               Emergencies.  During an emergency that requires the immediate procurement of public works projects, contractual services, professional services or materials, supplies and equipment, the City Manager or the City Managers designee, is authorized to procure these items without immediate Council approval and without giving notice for proposals.  The City Manager or the City Managers designee will report to the Council within 48 hours any and all actions taken to deal with the emergency. A written public record shall be kept showing the nature of the emergency and the City Manager or the City Managers designees authorization to proceed under the provisions of this section.  The emergency action shall be terminated at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant.

 

(1)               Emergency means a sudden, unexpected occurrence that poses a clear, eminent danger requiring immediate action to protect the health and safety of the public, including to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of life, health, property or public services. 

 

(b)               Sole Source Vendors.  When there is only one source that provides the necessary services, goods and equipment to ensure compatibility with existing City services, goods or equipment, or the services, goods or equipment are proprietary in nature, the City may procure the goods or services from the sole source.

 

(c)               Economic Efficiency. If a competitive market does not exist, or the City will not gain a competitive advantage by using the formal contract bid or other competitive procedure, or where the goods or services may be obtained more economically or efficiently without the procedure, the City may dispense with formal bidding or other competitive procedures.

 

(d)               Cooperative Purchases. If a competitive bid procedure has been conducted by another public agency, including, but not limited to, another local agency, the State through the California Multiple Award Schedule (CMAS), the federal government through the General Services Administration (GSA), or a joint powers agency, authority or alliance that procures competitive contracts; and (2) the price to the city is equal to or better than the price to that public agency, then the City may procure the contract without further bidding or other competitive procedures.

 

(e)               UPCCAA. If the City Council elects to be subject to the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (Public Contract Code sections 22000 et seq.), then the City shall follow those procedures in lieu of any conflicting procedures in this article.

 

(f)                Otherwise Authorized.  The City may utilize any alternative procurement method that is authorized by state or federal law.

The City Council may by a four-fifths (4/5) vote approve exceptions to this requirement only after expressly finding that a determination of a "not-to-exceed" price is not feasible.

            907.2.8A.1 General. In existing Group R, Divisions 1 and 3 occupancies, every dwelling unit and every guest room in a hotel, congregate residence or lodging house used for sleeping purposes shall be provided with smoke detectors conforming to State Fire Marshal Standards. All detectors shall be installed in accordance with the approved manufacturer's instructions.

 

            907.2.8A.2 Location within dwelling units. In dwelling units, a detector shall be installed in each sleeping room and at a point centrally located in the corridor or area giving access to each separate sleeping area. When the dwelling unit has more than one (1) story and in dwellings with basements, a detector shall be installed on each story and in the basement. In dwelling units where a story or basement is split into two (2) or more levels, the smoke detector shall be installed on each level. When sleeping rooms are on an upper level, the detector shall be placed at the ceiling of the upper level in close proximity to the stairway. In dwelling units where the ceiling height of a room open to the hallway serving the bedrooms exceeds that of the hallway by twenty-four (24") inches or more, smoke detectors shall be installed in the hallway and in the adjacent room. Detectors shall sound an alarm audible in all sleeping areas of the dwelling unit in which they are located.

 

            907.2.8A.3 Location in efficiency dwelling units, congregate residences and hotels. In efficiency dwelling units, hotel, motel, lodging house and congregate residence sleeping rooms, and in hotel suites, detectors shall be located on the ceiling or wall of the main room or each sleeping room. Where sleeping rooms are on an upper level within the efficiency dwelling unit or hotel suite, the detector shall be placed at the ceiling of the upper level in close proximity to the stairway. When actuated, the detector shall sound an alarm audible within the sleeping area of the dwelling unit, hotel suite or sleeping room in which it is located.

 

            907.2.8A.4 Power source. Smoke detectors required by this section may be battery operated or they may be wired into the building wiring system when such wiring is served from a commercial source. The detector shall emit a signal when the batteries are low. When required smoke detectors receive their primary power from the building wiring, such wiring shall be permanent, without a disconnecting switch other than those required for overcurrent protection and equipped with a battery backup.

 

            907.2.8A.5 Transfer of title. No person may transfer title to a dwelling unit or guest room required by this section to be equipped with a smoke detector without first filing with the City and the purchaser a statement that the dwelling unit or guest room is equipped with smoke detectors meeting the requirements of this section.

 

            (c)        Section 1003.2 of the California Fire Code is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

 

            "All buildings and structures constructed after the effective date of this ordinance, regardless of when permitted or approved, shall be provided with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with the applicable standards of the National Fire Protection Association, the rules and regulations of the State Fire Marshal and of this Code. In addition, an automatic sprinkler system shall be installed throughout an entire building or structure upon (1) the rehabilitation, remodeling or reconstruction of twenty-five (25%) percent or more of the gross square footage of an existing commercial or multiple unit residential building or structure, whether done at one time or through successive projects approved at any time after the effective date of this Ordinance; (2) the rehabilitation, remodeling or reconstruction of fifty (50%) percent or more of the gross square footage of an existing single family dwelling, whether done at one time or through successive projects approved at any time after the effective date of this Ordinance, except where the cost of the rehabilitation, remodeling or reconstruction is $10,000 or less as determined by the Building Official using city-approved construction cost estimates; and (3) upon a change in the use of any building or structure, except in the case of a change in the use of a single family residence to use as a family day care home, in which case the provisions of Health & Safety Code section 1596 et seq. shall apply. Where a property owner constructs changes to an existing building without first obtaining permits for such work and no readily available, reliable source of information exists to verify whether the unpermitted work triggers the provisions of this Section, a rebuttable presumption that the installation of fire sprinklers is required under this Section shall arise. The property owner may request a hearing before the Building Official, whose decision shall be appealable to the City Manager, for the purpose of rebutting the presumption. The City Council shall promulgate rules and regulations by resolution setting forth examples and guidance for the application of this ordinance."

 

            (d)       Sections 1003.2.3 through 1003.2.3.6 of the California Fire Code are hereby deleted.

(a)                The Traffic Engineer is authorized to determine and mark loading zones and passenger loading zones as follows:

 

(1)               At any place in the business district; and

(a)                (1) No stopping, standing or parking at any time except as permitted by the California Vehicle Code shall be designated by red paint upon the entire curb surface. Notwithstanding the foregoing prohibition of stopping, standing or parking in a red curb zone, the City Council hereby finds and determines that freight carriers provide vital services to business enterprises within the City on a daily basis and that the loading zones in the City are inadequate to facilitate the unloading of freight. Accordingly, freight carriers holding a permit issued by the City Council may stop and drop off freight in red zones within a commercial district, except freight carriers shall not:

 

(i)                 Stop within fifteen (15') feet of a fire hydrant;

 

(ii)               Stop within a fire lane;

 

(iii)             Stop within fifteen (15') feet of an intersection; and,

(3)               Loading zones shall be designated by yellow paint upon the entire curb surface. No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle in a loading zone at any time between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Monday through Saturday for any purpose other than the loading or unloading of passengers or materials. The foregoing limitation shall not apply on Sundays. The Traffic Engineer shall designate the maximum time limits applicable to each loading zone within the City. Such time limits shall be stated on the curb surface of each loading zone in prominent black lettering of not less than four (4") inches in height and one (1") inch in width.

 

(4)               Passenger loading zones shall be designated by white paint upon the entire curb surface. No person shall stop, stand, or park a vehicle in a passenger loading zone for any purpose other than the loading or unloading of passengers or for the purpose of depositing mail in an adjacent mail box. The Traffic Engineer shall designate the maximum time limits applicable to each passenger loading zone within the City. Such time limits shall be stated on the curb surface of each passenger loading zone in black lettering of not less than four (4") inches in height and one (1") inch in width. Such restrictions shall apply between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. of any day; provided, however, when such zone is in front of a hotel or in front of a mail box, the restrictions shall apply at all times.

 

(5)               Short term parking zones shall be designated by green paint upon the entire curb surface. The Traffic Engineer shall designate the maximum time limits applicable to each short term parking zone within the City not to exceed one (1) hour. The time limit for each such short-term parking zone shall be displayed in white lettering of not less than four (4") inches in height and one (1") inch in width. Such short-term time limits shall not be effective until signs have been erected by the Traffic Engineer giving notice thereof. No person shall stand or park a vehicle in excess of the designated time limit between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. of any day in front of any curb which has been so designated.

 

(6)               A taxicab stand shall be designated by white paint upon the entire curb surface and marked "Taxi" in black lettering of not less than four (4") inches in height and one (1") inch in width. It shall be unlawful for the operator of any vehicle other than a taxicab or automobile for hire to stop, stand or park such vehicle in such taxicab stand.

 

(7)               Autoette and motorcycle parking zones shall be established by the Traffic Engineer and shall be designated by white lines on the surface of the roadway and by black lettering on the curb surface of not less than four (4") inches in height and one (1") inch in width or by posting of signs giving notice of such autoette and parking zones.

 

(b)               Except as otherwise authorized by this article, when the Traffic Engineer has caused such curb markings to be placed, no person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle adjacent to any such legible curb marking in violation of any of the provisions of this section.

 

(1)         Building service contractors that provide electrical, plumbing, appliance/refrigeration or fire safety related services that have a current business license permit for such business, may apply for and be issued a permit, which permit when displayed shall enable the vehicle to remain in any parking area other than a red zone, fire lane or handicapped zone but only for so long as the service work is being performed in the downtown area. As used herein, the downtown area shall mean the area bounded by Clarissa to the east, Beacon to the south and Metropole to west.

 

a.                   Permits granting similar privileges that were issued prior to the enactment of this section shall remain valid for a period of one year. After such date, the Vehicle Clerk may issue such permits on a form approved by the City Manager, which permit shall be valid for a period of one year provided such service contractor continues to be in the service business. Appeals regarding the issuance of permits shall be made to the City Manager and subject to an appeal fee set  by resolution of the City Council. The City Council shall set a fee for processing of the permit application by resolution. Parking in violation of the terms and conditions of the permit shall be subject to the following penalties:

 

First offense:

Written warning

Second offense:

$100. fine

Third offense:

Maximum of $250. fine and/or suspension or revocation

 

            Penalties shall be administered by the Vehicle Hearing Officer and may be made based upon written submission by the Code Enforcement Officer and the permittee.

(8)               A commercial vehicle permit credit shall be issued to any person, organization, partnership, trust or corporation (i) for each valid commercial permit it surrenders to the City; or (ii) for each instance its name comes to the top of the commercial waiting list and it declines to apply for a commercial vehicle permit.

The temporary permit may be issued only to a nonresident owner who is occupying such property and who would otherwise be required to comply with the provisions of subsection (g)(2) of this section 4-4.1703 regarding overnight parking on public streets and rights-of-way. Temporary permits issued pursuant to this subsection shall be for such period of time as determined by the City Council and shall be conditioned upon use of such autoette only by the permittee.

 

h.            The applicant owns and operates a business located in the Pebbly Beach area and the closure of Pebbly Beach Road to pedestrians, most autoettes and motorcycles has resulted in a financial hardship, including but not limited to employee staffing, the ability to attract customers or transportation of materials and equipment, the applicant proposes to use the vehicle to transport employees, customers, equipment and materials to and from the business. As a condition of the permit, the permit issued pursuant to this subsection shall cease to be effective upon the reopening of Pebbly Beach Road to all autoettes and the vehicle shall be removed from Catalina Island within fifteen (15) days thereof unless the business operator is otherwise qualified for a permit for the vehicle. In addition, the temporarily permitted vehicle shall only be used for commercial purposes.

 

i.              Temporary vehicle permits issued pursuant to this section to local contractors and businesses shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

(ii)               The vehicle may only be used for the specific project or job described in a written application and no personal use is permitted;

 

(iii)             The vehicle cannot be used in the interior unless the specific project or job requires interior travel as described in a written application;

 

(iv)             The vehicle must be parked at the applicant's business or warehouse location overnight when not temporarily permitted. Parking at an off-street residential location does not satisfy this condition.

 

(v)               When in use, the vehicle must display a uniquely colored, laminated permit issued by the City bearing the job location and dates of validity.

 

(vii)           Payment of applicable fees.

 

(2)               Except for permits pursuant to (d)(1)h., the City Manager or his designee is authorized to issue temporary vehicle permits, effective for a time period as determined to be appropriate by the City Manager, but in no event for more than one (1) month. The City Manager may issue no more than three (3) temporary permits to any one (1) applicant or for any one (1) vehicle during any twelve (12) month period. The foregoing limitations shall not apply to temporary permits issued pursuant to subsection 4-4.1703(d)(1)g. to allow overnight parking on public streets and rights-of-way by nonresident property owners.

 

(3)               Except with regard to temporary permits issued pursuant to subsection (d)(1)h. which remain effective until Pebbly Beach Road is reopened, the Hearing Officer is authorized to issue a Temporary Vehicle Permit for a maximum period of six (6) months, or in the case of a Temporary Vehicle Permit pursuant to subsection (d)(1)e, for a maximum period of twelve (12) months. Any such permit may be renewed upon the officer making the findings set forth in subsection (d)(1)a. above.

 

(4)               All vehicles with temporary vehicle permits shall be provided by the permittee with overnight off-street parking and shall not be parked on any public street or right-of-way between the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m., unless otherwise provided in the permit.

 

(5)               The vehicle shall be used only for the purposes for which the permit is issued. Conditions may be attached to the permit to assure that the applicant complies with the purposes and intent of this article and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.

 

(6)               The Hearing Officer shall have the authority to impose a fine for violations of the conditions and terms of a temporary permit, up to a maximum of One Hundred and no/100ths ($100.00) Dollars for the first violation; Two Hundred and no/100ths ($200.00) Dollars for the second violation; and Three Hundred and no/100ths ($300.00) Dollars for the third violation.

(e)                Public Service/Public Health and Safety Vehicle Permits.

 

(1)               Public service vehicle permits may be granted by the Hearing officer for any vehicle owned and operated by the City, the County of Los Angeles, the State or Federal government; by electric, gas, water, or telephone companies certified by the California Public Utilities Commission, or by a religious institution that owns real property in the City of Avalon, provided the applicant demonstrates that the vehicle meets specific needs of the institution which cannot be met through another vehicle or source of transportation.

 

(2)               Public health and safety vehicle permits may be granted to a private business for vehicles owned by such business if the Hearing Officer decides, based upon recommendation of any city or Los Angeles County agency, that such vehicle is reasonably necessary in order to protect the public health and safety, and no other vehicle is reasonably available to fulfill such need. The Vehicle Clerk may grant a public health and safety vehicle permit to a private individual employed by the Long Beach Unified School District as a bus driver for a vehicle that is used by such person primarily for the purpose of traveling to the Isthmus to provide such driving services.

 

(3)               In granting such permits, the Hearing Officer shall determine whether an autoette will be sufficient to fulfill the public service/public health use, in which case the Hearing Officer shall so limit the permit. Even if the Hearing Officer determines that a full-sized vehicle is necessary, if the proposed vehicle to be permitted is oversized, the provisions of Section 4-4.1705 shall apply.

 

(4)               Except as provided herein, Public Service/Public Health and Safety permits shall be valid for a period of one (1) year only and may be renewed at the end of the period only if all of the findings set forth in subsections (1) and (2) are satisfied. The foregoing shall not apply to City or County law enforcement, fire and emergency service vehicles which are owned by and registered to the public agency. Permits issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance must be renewed on or before November 1, 2005.

 

(5)               In granting such permits, the Hearing Officer may impose such terms and conditions as appear appropriate to reduce the impact of the additional permitted vehicle, including but not limited to setting specific class, length, parking and other limitations or restrictions. Except as provided herein, vehicles permitted under this paragraph shall not be parked on any public street or right-of-way between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. unless such vehicle is parked so as to be immediately available to on-call city or county law enforcement, fire, and emergency services personnel, on-call persons employed by electric, gas, water or telephone companies certified by the California Public Utilities Commission, or on-call hospital personnel. The Vehicle Hearing Officer shall direct the Vehicle Clerk when to utilize special permits to identify a vehicle bearing a public service permit which may not be parked on public streets between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.

 

(f)                Commercial Rental Autoette Permits. Business entities or individuals whose activities are governed by Chapter 11 and Chapter 14 of Title 5 of this Code shall register all autoettes used in connection with such activities and comply with subsections in accordance with this paragraph (c)(2), (4) and (5).

An owner of a dwelling unit shall not be entitled to personally use an autoette permit issued for such unit unless the owner actually occupies or resides in the unit. Autoette permits may be requested by owners of hotels for transient occupants pursuant to Avalon Municipal Code Section 5-11.03. In the event more than one (1) autoette permit has been issued in connection with a dwelling unit to an occupant as of April 4, 1989, all but one (1) of such permits shall not be eligible for renewal upon their normal date of expiration in 1993. An autoette permit that has previously been issued to an owner of a dwelling unit who does not actually occupy or reside in the subject dwelling unit is eligible for renewal if proof of dedicated off-street parking for the autoette is provided. Such autoette permits may also be transferred to a person who actually occupies or resides in the dwelling unit. If proof of dedicated off-street parking is not provided during the five-year expiration period, such autoette permit held by a non-occupant or nonresident owner shall expire five (5) years from the date when renewal is sought and proof of off-street parking has not been provided. A hardship exception may be granted if the following criteria is met by a non-occupant or nonresident owner: A) The autoette is needed regularly and the need cannot be met by other means of transporation or by parking the autoette remotely; B) No off-street parking space is available for the vehicle on the dwelling unit's premises or within a reasonable distance of the dwelling unit;  C) The dwelling unit's garage or other parking space has not been converted to or placed in other use without City permission; and D) Another vehicle regularly parked on the dwelling unit premises cannot be displaced without equivalent hardship.

(3)               Autoette permits may be granted to a homeowners' association or similar nonprofit association  pursuant to a condition of approval of a development project as a means of mitigating traffic and parking impacts created by the project. The association shall pool the permits for use by members of the association, who shall not be eligible to obtain individual autoette permits.

 

(4)               Persons owning real property improved with a residential unit(s) who are nonresidents of Avalon at the time of application for an autoette permit and who acquired such real property on or after September 2, 1988, shall not be permitted to park such autoette on any public street or right-of-way between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. except as permitted by a valid temporary permit issued pursuant to subsection (d)(1)g. of this Section 4-4.1703 or except where the permittee holds a valid handicapped parking permit issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

(8)               All permits issued pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) shall expire on April 1 of each year and the permittee shall be required to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this Title in order to renew same.

 

(h)               Vintage Vehicle Permits. One vintage vehicle permit may be granted to any resident of the City and to any person who resides in a residence within three (3) miles of the boundaries of the City in exchange for a resident vehicle permit(s) upon proof of ownership of one or more vehicles which are each more than thirty (30) years old. The permit shall allow the permittee to use one such vehicle at a time and such permit shall be transferable to any vintage vehicle owned by the permittee. As a condition of the permit, the permittee shall provide overnight off-street parking for all vintage vehicles.

 

(i)                 Horse-Drawn Vehicle Permits. A horse-drawn vehicle permit may be issued by the City Council on a showing by the applicant that the operation of the vehicle will not adversely impact traffic, health and safety.

(a)                Interior Resident Vehicle Permits. An interior resident permit may be granted to the owner of any vehicle provided the owner resides in and the vehicle is permanently registered and garaged at an address more than three (3) miles outside of the City's jurisdiction and on Santa Catalina Island. The permit shall expire automatically should the vehicle or owner no longer meet these requirements. Except as provided in paragraph (1) below, no more than two (2) interior resident permits shall be issued per household. The maximum of two (2) interior permits shall include those issued prior to April 18, 1989. While in the City, no vehicle bearing an interior resident vehicle permit shall be parked on any public street or public right-of-way between the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m. Overnight parking of the vehicle within City limits, whether on public or private property, on more than an occasional basis, shall be grounds for revocation of such permit, unless the permit holder demonstrates good cause therefor. As used herein, good cause means unusual circumstances, such as family illness or similar circumstance, requiring a member of the permit holder's household to remain within City limits for not more than three (3) consecutive days.

 

(1)               Notwithstanding the two (2) permit limit, the Vehicle Hearing Officer may issue additional interior resident vehicles to persons within the same household, provided the applicant and the vehicle otherwise meet the requirements of subsection (a) above, and the applicant demonstrates the following:

 

a.             The transportation needs of the household cannot reasonably be met with the existing permitted or unpermitted vehicles;

 

b.            Parking impacts of the additional vehicle(s) while in the City of Avalon are mitigated by appropriate conditions.

 

            Any permits issued pursuant to this subsection (a)(1) shall be subject to annual renewal hearings to determine whether the foregoing requirements continue to be met.

 

(b)               Interior Commercial Vehicle Permits. An interior commercial permit may be granted to any person, organization, partnership, trust or corporation whose primary commercial or institutional activities are conducted at an address on Santa Catalina Island outside of and more than three (3) miles from the City of Avalon limits for use in connection with a commercial enterprise or institutional activity for any vehicle permanently garaged at an address on Santa Catalina Island, as follows:

 

(1)               The following findings must be made in an affirmative manner: The applicant must make a sufficient showing that the interior commercial vehicle permit or permits requested are necessary to the proper functioning of the commercial enterprise and that no other vehicle owned or available to the applicant will satisfy the needs of the applicant's enterprise.

 

(2)               The permit must be displayed and visible when the vehicle is within the City limits.

 

(3)               An interior commercial vehicle permit shall be valid for a period of one (1) year only and at the expiration of said period, may be renewed only if the findings set forth in paragraph (1) hereof are made.

(C)              The applicant shall not be entitled to any other full-sized vehicle permits or a commercial autoette permit, except that the applicant may be considered for a second interior commercial vehicle permit at such time that the applicant's name appears at the top of the Interior Commercial Vehicle waiting list and the Vehicle Hearing Officer makes the affirmative findings set forth in (b)(1) above.

 

(D)             The applicant provides proof of the ability to comply with paragraph (b)(5) below.

 

(4)               The Hearing Officer or City Council may add conditions to any permit to assure that the applicant complies with the purposes and intent of this article and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.

 

(5)               All vehicles bearing an interior commercial vehicle permit shall have overnight off-street parking and shall not be parked on any public street or right-of-way between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. unless the commercial vehicle is otherwise authorized to be so parked pursuant to the provisions of this title.

            As used in subsections (a), (c), (d) and (g), "transfer" means use of the permitted vehicle by anyone other than persons residing in the permit holder's household on more than a temporary or occasional basis. As used in subsections (b), (c) (if the temporary permit is issued to for a commercial purpose), (f) and (i), "transfer" means use of the permitted vehicle by persons employed by the commercial enterprise to which the permit was issued for purposes which are not related to the commercial enterprise on more than a temporary or occasional basis, or the use of the permitted vehicle by persons who are not employed by the commercial enterprise or who are not members of the permittee's household.

 

(a)                Resident Vehicle Permits. No resident vehicle permit issued under Section 44.1703 (a) shall be transferred or assigned from the permittee to any other person or from the vehicle to which it is issued to any other vehicle, except where the transfer complies with all requirements applicable to the issuance of such a permit, except as provided below, including but not limited to Section 4-4.1703(a)(1):

 

(1)               The permit is transferred from a vehicle removed from the City or otherwise permitted under this chapter to another vehicle owned by the same person, except that under no circumstances shall the permit be transferred to a vehicle in excess of the size limitation of Section 4-4.1705 unless the findings of that section are satisfied; or

 

(2)               The permit is transferred by operation of law or judicial decree (a) upon the death of the permittee to the permittee's surviving spouse or a child of the deceased aged sixteen (16) years or older who is a resident of Avalon at the time of the decedent's death or who establishes such residency within one (1) year of the decedent's death; or (b) on dissolution of marriage to one of the spouses, provided the spouse to whom the permit is transferred is a resident at the time of transfer, or, if the permit was issued prior to April 18, 1989, the spouse is the owner of real property in the City. In cases where more than one (1) child is qualified to receive a transfer under this provision but there is no will or other instrument specifying to which child the transfer will be made, and the children cannot decide between themselves, then the issue will be decided by a coin toss or other method of chance.

 

(3)               The permit was issued prior to April 18, 1989 and is transferred to an adult child of the permittee who is not living with the permittee, and who is a resident at the time of transfer of the resident vehicle permit.

 

(4)               The permit is transferred by will or other devise to his or her birth or adoptive parent, by an adult child who predeceases the parent, provided the parent is a resident at the time of death of the child. Where more than one (1) parent is qualified to receive a transfer under this provision but the parents live in separate households and the child does not specify in a will to which parent the transfer will be made, and the parents cannot decide between themselves, then the issue will be decided by a coin toss or other method of chance.

 

(b)               Commercial Vehicle Permits and Credits. Commercial vehicle permits and credits shall not be transferred or assigned, except:

 

(1)               Upon the sale or transfer of a commercial enterprise, or a portion of a multiple commercial enterprise which constitutes a separate and complete business subject to meeting the criteria contained in Section 4-4.1703(b);

 

or

 

(2)               From one vehicle to another in ownership or lawful possession of the same permittee, as long as the vehicle from which the permit is transferred is removed from the City or otherwise permitted under this chapter, the new vehicle is used for the same business as the vehicle from which the permit is transferred, and the new vehicle is not in excess of the size limitation of Section 4-4.1705, unless the findings of that section are satisfied.

 

            Transfers or assignments pursuant to paragraph (b)(l) hereunder require a hearing pursuant to Section 4-4.1703(b) prior to the transfer of the permit; transfers or assignments pursuant to paragraphs (a)(l), (2) and (3) and (b)(2) do not require a hearing except as otherwise required under Section 4-4.1705, except that the Vehicle Clerk may request documentation or other proof of qualification prior to a transfer under those sections.

Notwithstanding Section 5-11.03, the owner of a rental unit in a residential dwelling who is otherwise entitled to the permit may grant use of the autoette without separate charge to any occupant of the rental unit during the rental period, in which event the owner shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with all state insurance requirements applicable to such use. No person shall arrange or participate in the use of an autoette by the renter of one household where the permit for the autoette was issued to a different household, except that this shall not prohibit a permittee or assignee from allowing temporary use of the permitted vehicle by friends or family members.

 

            Transfers or assignments hereunder do not require a hearing except as otherwise required under Section 4-4.1705.

A sound level which exceeds the following measurements shall be conclusive proof of an unreasonable sound level under this section: (1) Any motor vehicle with a manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating of six thousand (6,000) pounds or more and any combination of vehicles towed by such motor vehicle - 82 dB; (2) Any motorcycle other than a motor driven cycle - 77 dB; (3) Any other motor vehicle and any combination of vehicles towed by such motor vehicle - 74 dB.

 

            Measurement of decibels levels shall be made pursuant to the testing procedures set forth in subsection (b) herein.

 

(b)               Testing Procedure.

 

(1)               Instrumentation. Noise levels shall be measured by a sound level meter which meets ANSI S1.4 Type 1-IEC 651 or ANSI S1.4 Type 2-IEC651 requirements of the American National Standard Specifications for Sound Level Meters and which has been calibrated with an accuracy of + or - 0.5 dB within the time period recommended by the manufacturer.

 

(2)               Test Site; Local Conditions. Measurement shall be made after the vehicle travels for a distance of at least twenty (20') feet and is at a constant speed of between fifteen (15) and twenty (20) m.p.h. in an open space which consists of a reasonably flat area made of concrete, asphalt, or other hard material having a high acoustical reflectivity. Ambient noise levels at the measuring site during such testing shall be at least 15 dB less than the maximum measurement permitted hereunder for the vehicle to be tested.

 

(3)               Measurement. At least one measurement shall be made. Additional measurements may be taken if the vehicle to be tested is not driven at constant speeds or for the distance specified above. The measurement shall be made by holding the instrument at waist level, directed at the vehicle as it passes and from a distance of twenty-five (25') feet from the vehicle.

 

(4)               Statement of Results. A test report shall be made which includes all relevant details regarding the testing, including identification of the vehicle tested, the type of vehicle, a description of abnormal conditions, the location of the test site, ground conditions and weather conditions, measurement instrumentation, location and orientation of the instrument, sound level determined by the test(s), and the background sound level at each measuring point.

 

(c)                Violations. Violations of this section shall be punishable as an infraction. All violations shall be subject to a correction notice in accordance with the provisions of Vehicle Code section 40610. A first violation shall be subject to a Fifty and no/100ths ($50.00) Dollar fine; a second violation within one (1) year shall be subject to a Seventy-Five and no/100ths ($75.00) Dollar fine; each additional violation within one (1) year shall be subject to a One Hundred Fifty and no/100ths ($150.00) Dollar fine.

Sec. 4-4.1714        Definitions.
 

            The following words and phrases shall have the following meanings when used in this article:

 

(a)                "Autoette" shall mean any of the following: (1) a motor vehicle having three (3) or more wheels in contact with the ground, an unladen weight of no more than one thousand eight hundred (1,800) pounds and an overall length of no greater than one hundred twenty (120") inches including the front and back bumpers, without regard to classification or designation of such vehicle by the Department of Motor Vehicles, but shall not include any motor vehicle that is an "all-terrain vehicle" as defined in California Vehicle Code § 111 or (2) a vehicle that qualifies for an autoette permit pursuant to the exceptions set forth in Section 4-4.1705. Holders as of February 1, 2007 of a residential autoette permit issued for use of a motor vehicle which falls within the definition of "all-terrain vehicle" as set forth in California Vehicle Code § 111 shall be entitled to renew the permit provided such vehicle is and continues to be registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles for use on public streets; however, these permits shall not be transferable, and purchasers or assignees of the vehicle shall have no right or entitlement to a residential autoette permit for the all-terrain vehicle. The method of measurement of autoettes shall be performed by the Vehicle Clerk in accordance with polices adopted by the City Council. The provisions of Section 4-4.1705 regulating the width of autoettes shall also apply. Autoettes which exceed the length limitation specified herein that were permitted by the City prior to November 7, 1995 shall be exempt from the length limitations set forth herein. The exemptions shall apply to the autoette, regardless of ownership transfers. Vehicles classified as motorcycles by the Department of Motor Vehicles which would be classified as "autoettes" hereunder but were issued a permit by the City prior to February 1, 2000, including a temporary permit pursuant to Section 4-4.1703(d), shall be subject to the definitions and rules for "autoettes" upon the transfer of ownership of the vehicles.

 

(b)               "Resident" shall mean any person who maintains a principal place of residence within the boundaries specified in any provision under this article and who lives in such residence on more than a temporary, occasional or transient basis. Any person who spends in the aggregate more than nine (9) months of any twelve (12) month period within the boundaries specified in any provision under this article shall be presumed to be a resident thereof. However, this presumption may be overcome by proof that the person is within the boundaries specified in this article only for a temporary, transient, or occasional purpose even though the length of time during which the person is within the specified boundaries is greater than nine (9) months.

 

(c)                "Principal place of residence" shall mean the place where a person resides when not called elsewhere for labor or some other temporary or special purpose and to which one returns and remains. When a person is called elsewhere for labor or some other temporary or special purpose, no one other than persons residing at the permit holder's principal place of residence shall use the permitted vehicle. Violations of this provision shall result in revocation of the permit pursuant to the procedures specified herein.

 

(1)               The following are evidence of principal residency:      

 

a.                   Voter registration at the residence address;

(d)               "Household" shall mean all persons residing in a dwelling unit.

 

(e)                "Ownership of property" shall mean a recorded interest in real property that consists of title, whether legal or equitable, held solely or jointly with others.

            (2)        The extent to which the proposed weapon discharge presents a threat to safety, including, but not limited to: (a) the proximity of the shooting location to places where persons or flammable materials may be; (b) the range and accuracy of the weapon and type of ammunition to be used; (c) the experience of the permittee with the weapon and the conditions under which the weapon will be used; (d) prior weapons permit compliance; and (e) visibility factors. A member of City staff or the Sheriff's Department shall make a site visit with the permittee to assess the location for safety hazards.

 

            (3)        Means by which the permit may be conditioned so as to lessen identifi­able safety hazards.

 

            (c)        Conditions of Approval. The City Council may promulgate by resolution a list of conditions it deems necessary or appropriate for this purpose. The City Manager, or the City Council on appeal, may impose additional reasonable conditions on the permit that are designed to lessen safety hazards.

 

            (d)        Term of Permit. Weapons permits shall be valid for a maximum period of six (6) months or such shorter term as the City Manager or City Council on appeal may deem ap­propriate. Permits may be renewed in accordance with the procedures applicable to issuance of same.

 

            (e)        Revocation of Permits. The City Manager may set a hearing on five (5) days notice to the applicant and shall have the authority to revoke or suspend any permit upon de­termining that the permittee has violated the terms and conditions thereof. Such revocation or suspension may be appealed to the City Council in accordance with the procedure set forth in subsection (f) below.

 

            (f)         Notification of Determination and Appeals. Not later than five (5) working days after submission of a complete application, the City Manager shall send the applicant by mail written notice of action on the permit, including a list of all conditions, if granted, or a brief statement of the reasons for denial. If the application is granted, the City Manager shall send notice of the grant of any permit and the time within which an appeal may be filed to all prop­erty owners within three hundred fifty (350) yards of the location where the weapon is to be discharged. The grant of a permit shall not be final and cannot be acted on until such appeal period has passed. The City Manager's decision may be appealed in writing by the permittee, the affected property owner or any other interested person no later than fifteen (15) days after the date upon which the notification to the applicant or property owner is mailed. If an appeal is filed from the denial of a permit by the applicant, then the City shall notify all property own­ers within three hundred fifty (350) yards of the location where the weapon is to be discharged of the filing of the appeal and the date set for hearing thereon.

CHAPTER 6 - SPECIAL EVENTS
 

Prior ordinance history includes portions of Ordinance No. 674, 706, 953 and 1041.

 

 

            Sec. 4-6.01            Intent.
 

            The intent of this chapter is to provide a regulatory framework for permitting special events. The use of City streets or other City-owned or controlled property by large groups causes wear and tear on turf, park equipment and facilities, and requires City staff time to provide support services such as traffic control. Such uses also subject neighboring residents and businesses to noise and traffic. As such, the purpose of this chapter is to ensure that special events are conducted so as not to violate any other ordinance or regulation of the City or cause detrimental effects to surrounding properties and the community. It is also the intent of the City to protect the rights of the people to engage in expressive activities on City property and to regulate the time, place and manner of these activities in a reasonably and minimally restrictive fashion.

(§1, Ord. 1105-11, eff. March 31, 2011)

 

            Sec. 4-6.02            Definitions.
 

            (a)        "Expressive activity" shall mean conduct, the sole and principal object of which is the expression, dissemination or communication by verbal, visual, literary or auditory means of opinion, views or ideas. Expressive activity includes, but is not limited to, public oratory and the distribution of literature.

 

            (b)        "Parade" shall mean a parade, procession, march, pageant, review, ceremony or exhibition which is conducted in, on, upon or along any portion of any public street, sidewalk or other property owned or controlled by the City, so as to impede, obstruct, impair or interfere with the free use of such public street, sidewalk or other public property of the City. Parades shall be considered special events for purposes of this chapter, and shall be classified according to the categories of special events listed in subsection (c).

 

            (c)        "Special event" shall mean any temporary event, as further described herein, not exceeding thirty (30) days, whether indoors or outdoors, or on improved or unimproved public or private property, which is inconsistent with the permanent use to which the property may legally be put, or the occupancy levels permitted thereon. "Special event" shall also refer to (i) any activity that may result in the closure of any public streets; (ii) any activities which may temporarily require the installation of materials or devices using building, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, flammable or similar materials; and (iii) short-term events such as any show, circus, concert, festival, carnival, dance open to the public, exhibition, lecture, auction, rave, boxing match, wrestling match, walk-a-thon, marathon run, cycling event, sporting event, permitted film production event, farmers' market, pumpkin patch, outdoor sales (including, but not limited to, vehicle sales) or any combination thereof, which members of the public are invited for free or admitted for a fee. All special events shall be classified under one of the following categories:

 

            (1)        "Major special events" shall mean those events for which participation by two hundred (200) or more persons is expected and/or which will result in the closure of a City roadway, street, right-of-way, or highway, or the occupancy of more than fifty (50%) percent of a City park, for more than eight (8) hours. Examples of major special events include carnivals, parades, festivals, car races, marathon events, and street fairs.

 

            (2)        "Minor special events" shall mean those events for which participation by less than two hundred (200) persons is expected, and/or which will result in the closure of a City roadway, street, right-of-way, or highway for less than eight (8) hours, or the occupancy of (i) more than fifty (50%) percent of a City park for less than eight (8) hours, or (ii) less than fifty (50%) percent of a City park for more than eight (8) hours. Examples of minor special events include 5K/10K races, organized bicycle rides, boxing matches, block parties, and grand openings.

 

            (3)        "Miscellaneous special events" means those events which fit within the special event definition but are neither major special events nor minor special events as defined herein.

 

            (d)       "Special event permit" shall mean a permit issued pursuant to this chapter.

(§1, Ord. 1105-11, eff. March 31, 2011)

 

            Sec. 4-6.03            Permit Required.
 

            (a)        Except as provided by this Code or pursuant to the terms of a permit, lease or contract which has been specifically authorized by the City Council, no person shall conduct or cause to be conducted, participate or engage in, hold, manage, permit or allow another to conduct a special event, in, on or upon any City street, sidewalk, alley, park, way, public place, public property or public right-of-way which is owned or controlled by the City without first having obtained a written permit from the City Manager, or, as provided by this chapter, from the City Council.

 

            (b)        The City Manager is authorized to issue permits for special events pursuant to the procedures established in this chapter.

 

            (c)        No permits issued under the provisions of this chapter shall be transferable or movable to another location or another applicant.

 

            (d)       Issuance of a special event permit pursuant to this chapter does not obligate or require the City to provide City services, equipment or personnel in support of an event, although the City may provide such services, equipment or personnel if they are reasonably available and the event organizer makes provisions to reimburse the City for the cost thereof, or the City may provide such services, equipment or personnel at no charge if there is a public purpose to be furthered in doing so.

(§1, Ord. 1105-11, eff. March 31, 2011)

 

            Sec. 4-6.04            Exempt Events and Activities.
 

            (a)        The following activities are exempt from the special event permit requirement:

            (4)        Events which take place on streets, sidewalks or other public rights-of-way owned or controlled by the City but which do not meet the definitions of a parade or special event, including, but not limited to, lawful picketing, provided that all applicable traffic regulations, laws or controls are complied with;

 

            (5)        Spontaneous parades, assemblies or demonstrations involving expressive activity and which are occasioned by news or affairs coming into public knowledge within five (5) days of such parade, assembly or demonstration, provided that the organizers thereof give written notice to the City Manager at least twenty four (24) hours prior to such parade or assembly. Such written notice shall contain all of the following information:

 

            a.         The name, address and telephone number of the person or persons seeking to conduct the parade or assembly. This person or these persons shall be considered a permittee for the purposes of this section;

 

            b.         The name, address and telephone number of the headquarters of the organization, if any, and of the organizer or responsible head of such organization by whom or on whose behalf the parade or assembly is proposed to be conducted;

 

            c.         The name, address and telephone number of the person who will chair the parade or assembly and who will be responsible for its conduct;

 

            d.         The location and date of the proposed parade or assembly, including the assembly area, disbanding area, and the route to be traveled;

 

            e.         An estimate of the approximate number of persons who will be participating in the parade or assembly and an estimate of the approximate number of persons who will be observing the parade or assembly;

 

            f.          The time at which the parade or assembly will start and conclude;

 

            g.         The type of security or other arrangements that will be provided to assure that participants are properly directed.

 

            (b)        The City Manager may impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on spontaneous parades, assemblies or demonstrations governed by this section whether or not such activities are governed by the permit requirements set forth in this chapter.

 

            (c)        The City Manager may deny permission to conduct a spontaneous parade, assembly or demonstration if the City Manager makes a finding requiring denial pursuant to Section 4-6.07. Such finding by the City Manager shall be made no later than six (6) hours before the scheduled start time for the event. If the City Manager makes a finding pursuant to Section 4-6.07, the City Manager shall immediately provide notice of the denial, including the reason or reasons for the denial, by telephone to the permittee and shall also provide written notice of the denial including the reason for the denial. In lieu of denial, the City Manager may propose to the applicant an alternative time, route, venue or manner of conducting the activity which alternative would be acceptable to the City and which would obviate any finding made pursuant to Section 4-6.07.

(§1, Ord. 1105-11, eff. March 31, 2011)

 

            Sec. 4-6.05            Permit Application; Filing and Fees.
 

            (a)        Applications for permits to conduct parades and special events shall be completed in writing on a form provided by the City and shall be filed with the City Manager and, unless an exception is made by the City Council upon a written request, the following periods still govern the time for filing an application for a special event permit.

 

            (1)        Major special events. Applications shall be filed no more than thirteen (13) months and not less than sixty (60) working days prior to the opening date of the event.

 

            (2)        Minor special events. Applications shall be filed no more than nine (9) months and not less than thirty (30) working days prior to the opening date of the event.

 

            (3)        Miscellaneous special events. Applications shall be filed no more than six (6) months and not less than seven (7) working days prior to the event.

 

            (4)        Notwithstanding the application deadlines described above, an application for a special event permit by a person engaging in expressive activity, as defined in this chapter, for which a permit is required pursuant to this Chapter, shall be filed not less than four (4) working days prior to the event. If an applicant for a special event permit involving expressive activity desires to ensure the opportunity for an appeal to the City Council pursuant to Section 4-6.11, the application shall be filed with the City Manager not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the proposed event. Failure to file the application at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed activity shall be deemed a waiver of the right of appeal to the City Council in connection with the permit application.

 

            (b)        In the event an application is not filed within the required time, as specified herein, the applicant shall have the opportunity to demonstrate that the circumstances giving rise to the proposed special event did not reasonably allow the applicant to file for a permit within the time prescribed and that imposition of the time limitation would unreasonably restrict the right of free speech or assembly. If such demonstration is made, and the City Manager makes none of the findings set forth in Section 4-6.07 of this chapter, he or she shall issue a permit despite the lack of advance prior notice. In lieu of or in addition to this opportunity, the applicant may request a waiver of the timely filing requirement by the City Council at its next regular meeting, or at a special meeting which may be called prior thereto by the City Council to consider such matter. The City Council may waive the requirement if it finds that unusual or unforeseen circumstances justify the waiver.

 

(c)        (1)        Only one (1) major special event and one (1) minor special event permit may be obtained every week for any particular event site, unless the City Manager determines that granting additional permits will not cause an excessive burden on the City or nearby residents, businesses, and facilities. This subsection, shall not apply however, to an event involving an exercise of free speech rights.

 

            (2)        In the case where two (2) identical or similar events, whether major, minor, or miscellaneous, have applied for special event permits for events to be held within twelve (12) weeks of one another, the City Manager will have the discretion to grant or deny one of the permit applications using the criteria in Section 4-6.08(a).

 

            (3)        In the case where one (1) major, minor, or miscellaneous event has already been permitted, or has traditionally been held on a certain day or time of year, and additional similar or identical events apply for special event permits for events to be held within twelve (12) weeks of such event, the City Manager will have discretion, using the criteria set forth in Section 4-6.08(a) to grant or deny such permit.

 

            (d)       Except as otherwise provided by this Code or other applicable law, rule or regulation, or by the terms of a permit, license, lease or contract which has been specifically authorized by the City Council, each permit applicant shall submit a nonrefundable permit application fee, in an amount as established by resolution of the City Council, for the use of City streets or other City-owned or controlled property pursuant to this chapter. The applicant shall obtain all required permits and pay all fees required under this chapter and any other permits and fees required under this Code.

 

            (e)        Any indigent, natural person who cannot apply for a permit because of an inability arising from such indigence to pay the application fee shall not be required to pay the fee. Application for indigent status shall be made at the time the permit application is filed and shall be accompanied by such relevant information and documentation as may be reasonably necessary to verify such status.

If the special event is proposed to be conducted for, on behalf of, or by an organization, the name, address and telephone number of the headquarters of the organization, and of the authorized head of such organization;

 

            (2)        The name, address and telephone number of the person who will be responsible for management of the special event;

            (7)        Such other information relating to the special event as the City Manager may require.

 

            (b)        If the special event is a parade, the following information is also required:

 

            (1)        The approximate number of persons who will participate in the parade, and the number and kind of vehicles and animals which will constitute the parade and the route of the parade;

 

            (2)        The location of the assembly area of the parade;

 

            (3)        The location of the dispersal area of the parade;

 

            (4)        The plans for the assembly and dispersal of the parade including the times thereof;

 

            (5)        A statement as to whether the parade will occupy all or only a portion of the streets proposed to be traversed;

 

            (6)        A description of any fees to be charged to participants or spectators in connection with the special event.

(§1, Ord. 1105-11, eff. March 31, 2011)

 

            Sec. 4-6.07            Permit Issuance or Denial.
 

            (a)        Completed applications for a permit authorizing a major special event or a minor special event shall be denied, approved, or conditionally approved by the City Manager within twenty (20) days after the City Manager determines that the application is complete.

Completed applications for a permit involving expressive activity as defined in this chapter shall be denied, approved, or conditionally approved in writing by the City Manager within two (2) business days after the City Manager determines that the application is complete. If the application is denied, the written notice of such denial shall set forth the reasons for the denial.

 

            (b)        In the case of expressive activity, the City Manager shall promptly attempt to notify the applicant orally of the approval or denial of a permit, and provide written notification to the applicant as soon as it is reasonably practical to do so. Such notice shall provide detailed facts and reasons for any denial or conditional approval. The City Manager shall consult with the City Attorney before denying or conditionally approving a permit involving expressive activity (including all activities wherein the applicant claims or contends that the proposed event involves expressive activity) as that term is defined in this chapter.

 

            (c)        The City Manager shall issue a permit, conditioned upon the applicant's written agreement to comply with any and all terms of this chapter and any conditions imposed on the issuance of the permit, unless he or she finds that:

 

            (1)        The information contained in the application is false or intentionally misleading, the applicant failed to remit fees and deposits, or failed to provide an indemnification agreement if required, or failed to provide supplemental application information after having been notified;

 

            (2)        The temporary use of the City's rights-of-way or property will endanger public health welfare or safety for the reasons set forth herein, and reasonable adjustment to street and property maintenance, or police, fire or ambulance protection would not alleviate such danger;

 

            (3)        An application received prior in time has been approved for the same time and place or so close as to exceed the ability of the City to provide police and other services for both uses, events or activities;

 

            (4)        The time, route or size of the proposed use, event or activity will disrupt the surrounding neighborhood or community beyond practical solution;

 

            (5)        The proposed use, event or activity will be located in or upon a premises, building or structure, which is hazardous to the health or safety of the employees or patrons of the premises, business, activity or event, or the general public, under the standards established by the City's Building or Fire Codes, or other applicable codes, as set forth in Title 8 of this Code;

 

            (6)        The proposed use, event or activity will require the diversion of public safety or other City employees from their normal duties, so as to unreasonably reduce adequate levels of service or municipal functions to any other portion of the City;

 

            (7)        The preparation for or the conduct of the proposed use, event or activity will unduly impede, obstruct or interfere with the City's ability to perform municipal functions or furnish City services in the vicinity of the event area;

 

            (8)        The proposed use, event or activity is in conflict with other applicable provisions of Federal, State and/or local laws;

 

            (9)        The ability of persons to enter and exit residential or business properties impacted by the event will be unreasonably impaired considering factors such as the duration, size and scope of the event; or

 

            (10)      The applicant has violated significant condition(s) of a previous license issued for the same or similar event within the prior thirty-six (36) months. The City shall notify the applicant in writing of any such violations within sixty (60) days of the violation.

            Sec. 4-6.08            Considerations.
 

            When determining whether or not a special events permit shall be issued pursuant to this chapter, particularly in the event that two (2) applications have been filed for the same date or week, the City Manager shall take the following into consideration:

 

            (a)        When two (2) or more special event permits are requested for similar or identical events to be held within twelve (12) weeks of one another, whether the requests are made simultaneously or not, the City Manager will make a determination as to whether both events will receive permits, or whether only one (1) permit shall be issued, using the following criteria:

 

            (1)        The tax status of the organizations submitting the applications with not-for-profit organizations receiving preference over for-profit organizations;

 

            (2)        The charitable purpose or nature of the proposed event or activity with preference for events benefiting charities directly serving City residents;

 

            (3)        The recurrent nature of the proposed events or activities, and, particularly, the history of the proposed events or activities and past in involvement of the applicants;

 

            (4)        The benefits to local business and the City, including consideration of the taxes and fees to be generated by the events;

 

            (5)        Which special event permit application was received first and whether other special events have already been permitted for the same day or week;

 

            (6)        Whether the special events requested are compatible with one another;

 

            (7)        The likelihood of both events being successful;

 

            (8)        Whether the benefits of holding both events outweigh any drawbacks or inconveniences to the community of holding both events;

 

            (9)        The amount of time between the proposed event dates;

 

            (10)      The history of the events in the community, if any;

 

            (11)      The predicted positive impact on businesses, charities, and nonprofits within the community from both events, and any detrimental impacts from the events.

 

            (b)        The charitable purpose or nature of the proposed event or activity with special consideration for events benefiting charities directly serving City residents; and

 

            (c)        The recurrent nature of the proposed event or activity, and, particularly, the history of the proposed event or activity and past involvement of the applicant.

 

            (d)       The benefits to local business, the community and City, including considerations of taxes and fees to be generated by the event.

            The City Council may cause a nuisance to be summarily abated if the City Manager determines that the nuisance creates an emergency condition involving an immediate threat to the physical safety of a person or persons or creates an immediate threat of substantial property damage.

On request of the owner or posses­sor, the City Manager shall hold a hearing on the need for summary abatement but such hear­ing shall be held without unreasonable delay, taking into account the circumstances of the emergency condition.  If, in the sole discretion of the City Manager, the owner or possessor of the property containing the nuisance which creates an emergency condition fails to take imme­diate and meaningful steps to abate the nuisance, the City may abate the nuisance and charge the costs of abatement to the owner or possessor.  The City shall notify in writing the owner or possessor of the property of the cost of abatement in accordance with Section 4-11.107.

CHAPTER 15 - STREET PERFORMERS
 

 

Sec. 4-15.101   Purpose.
 

            The City Council finds that the existence in the City of street performers provides a public amenity that enhances the character of the City and seeks to encourage such performances in a manner consistent with the overall public interest. The City Council also recognizes that street performers seek to and do draw crowds to their performance. This can create serious safety problems by impacting the ability of pedestrians to move safely on sidewalks and through cross walks and impeding the response time of safety personnel. It can also impact access to and egress from businesses. Cognizant that street performers are engaged in First Amendment activities, this chapter imposes reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on street performers to the extent necessary to ensure the safety of performers, their audience, and the general public and to prevent unreasonable interference with residents' enjoyment of peace and quiet in their homes or the ability of businesses to operate and conduct their business.

(§1, Ord. 1083-09, eff. April 16, 2009)

Exhibit A for Section 4-15.102(d)
 

Sec. 4-15.103                    Rules and Regulations.
 

            (a)        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, but subject also to Sections 4-15.104 and 4-15.105, no performer may perform:

 

            (1)        Within ten (10') feet of any trolley stop or any designated taxi drop off/pick-up area;

            (b)        A person must obtain a performance permit pursuant to Section 4-15.104 if any of the following conditions apply:

 

            (1)        The performer intends to perform with any prop, equipment, instrument, or other item.

 

            (2)        The performer has performed in the past and has drawn a crowd of sufficient size such that the crowd could potentially pose a safety hazard or be considered a public nuisance. A safety hazard or public nuisance includes, but is not limited to, crowds potentially blocking ingress and egress from businesses and residences, crowds preventing other pedestrians or safety personnel from traveling easily on sidewalks, or crowds creating noise that could disturb the quiet enjoyment of nearby residents and business owners.

 

            (3)        An unpermitted performer has been told by law enforcement, fire officials, or code enforcement officials that any and all future performances will require a permit due to the size and/or nature of the crowds such a performer has drawn, because such crowds could potentially pose a safety hazard or be considered a public nuisance as described in Section 4-15.103(b)(2).

 

            (c)        A performer and the performer's equipment may not block or obstruct the free and safe movement of pedestrians. If a sufficient crowd gathers to observe a performer such that the passage of the public through a public area is blocked or obstructed, a code enforcement officer, police officer or fire official may disperse the portion of the crowd that is blocking or obstructing the passage of the public. If a performer cannot conduct a performance in a location without blocking or obstructing the passage of the public, a code enforcement officer, police officer or fire official may cause the performer to leave the location or require that the performer relocate his/her equipment, but shall not prevent the performer from occupying another location in compliance with this chapter.

 

            (d)       A performer who performs for a charge shall obtain a business license and be subject to all applicable provisions of Title 3. A performer who performs without charge shall not be required to obtain a business license pursuant to Title 3.

 

            (e)        No performer shall construct, erect, or maintain any stage, platform, or similar structure for use during any performance unless the stage or platform:

            (4)        Has beveled edges.

 

            (f)        No performer shall use any knife, sword, torch, flame, axe, saw, or other object that can cause serious bodily injury to any person, or engage in any activity, including but not limited to, acrobatics, tumbling, or cycling, that can cause serious bodily injury to any person.

 

            (g)        No performer shall use any generator, wet cell battery with removable fill caps, or connect or maintain an electrical cord to an adjacent building or to a City power source.

 

            (h)        No performer shall utilize any speaker, microphone or mechanical amplification device.

 

            (i)         No performer shall litter his or her performance site.

 

            (j)         No performer shall utilize or prevent the public from utilizing any public benches, waste receptacles, or other street furniture during the performance.

            (1)        No performer shall place any object on a public sidewalk which causes less than a four-foot contiguous sidewalk width being kept clear for pedestrian passage.

 

            (m)       No performer shall perform with more instruments, props, equipment, or other items than the performer can reasonably transport or remove at one time.

 

            (n)        No performer shall place his/her instruments, props, equipment, or other items on a public sidewalk, public street, or public right-of-way for more than one (1) hour without performing in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

(a)               Medical Cannabis Delivery Service Business Permit Required to Engage in Medical Cannabis Business.

 

(1)               No person may engage in any medical cannabis delivery service business unless the person (1) has a valid medical cannabis delivery service business permit from the City of Avalon and (2) is currently in compliance with all applicable state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the medical cannabis delivery service business and the medical cannabis delivery service business activities, including the duty to obtain any required state licenses.

 

(2)               If and until Health and Safety Code Section 11362.775, subdivision (a), is repealed, the City intends that persons eligible to operate collectives or cooperatives under that subdivision shall be eligible to apply for a City permit to conduct medical cannabis activities, but only to the degree those activities are authorized under state law for collectives and cooperatives.  If and when the Health and Safety Code Section 11362.775, subdivision (a), is repealed, or as soon as collectives and cooperatives are no longer permitted under state law, any City medical cannabis delivery service business permit holder operating as a collective or cooperative who has not already obtained a state license for the medical cannabis delivery service business activities they are engaged in shall automatically forfeit his or her City medical cannabis delivery service business permit.  At that point they shall no longer be authorized to engage in any medical cannabis delivery service activities in the City until they obtain both a City issued medical cannabis delivery service business permit and a state license for that medical cannabis activity.

            Sec. 5-20.040          Medical Cannabis Businesses.
 

(a)               Medical Cannabis Delivery Service Businesses.

 

(1)               Initial Maximum Amount of Medical Cannabis Delivery Service Business Permits.  Upon the effective date of this provision, the City Council may issue a maximum of one (1) medical cannabis delivery service business permit to one (1) qualified medical cannabis delivery service business at any one given time.  The permit shall be issued in accordance with the application and permit approval process contained in this chapter and resolutions and policies adopted pursuant to this chapter.  The medical cannabis delivery service business must obtain a medical cannabis delivery service business permit from the City before commencing operations, must be in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws pertaining to its operation, including obtaining all necessary licenses from the state, and shall comply with all applicable operational and zoning requirements set forth in the Avalon Municipal Code.  Nothing in this chapter creates a mandate that the City Council must issue any medical cannabis business permits to medical cannabis delivery service businesses if the City Council determines that there are no qualified applicants, the proposed locations for medical cannabis delivery service business is incompatible with neighboring land uses, or if the City Council determines that the issuance of a medical cannabis delivery service business permit would have a negative effect on the health, safety, or welfare of the citizens or businesses of Avalon, or for any other reason allowed by law.

 

(2)               City Council Review and Increased Maximum Number of Medical Cannabis Delivery Service Business Permits to be Issued.  Twelve (12) months after the initial medical cannabis delivery service business permit has been issued, the City Manager shall deliver a report to the City Council during a regular meeting which examines the positive and negative impacts that the medical cannabis delivery service business has had on the community during the preceding twelve (12) months.  The report shall include, among other things, an analysis of how the medical cannabis delivery service business has complied with state and local regulations, any positive or negative community and law enforcement impacts, and any revenue generated.  If after hearing the report the City Council makes a determination that there are no significant consequences of allowing a medical marijuana delivery service business to operate in the City, the City Council at its sole discretion may vote to expand the number of authorized medical cannabis delivery services permits to be issued up to a maximum of two (2).  If the City Council takes no action, or finds that the impacts are unacceptable, then the maximum number of medical cannabis delivery service businesses  authorized shall continue to be limited to one (1) as provided in subsection(a) above.

 

(b)               All Other Medical Cannabis Businesses.

 

            Until further action by the City Council to amend this chapter has been taken, medical cannabis businesses other than medical cannabis delivery services are not permitted to operate within the City.

If the City or state has determined, based on substantial evidence, that the permittee or applicant is in violation of the requirements of this chapter, of the Citys Municipal Code, or of the state rules and regulations, and the City or state has determined that the violation is grounds for termination or revocation of the medical cannabis delivery service business permit.

 

(5)               The City Manager or his designee is authorized to make all decisions concerning the issuance of a renewal permit.  In making the decision, the City Manager or his designee is authorized to impose additional conditions to a renewal permit, if it is determined to be necessary to ensure compliance with state or local laws and regulations or to preserve the public health, safety or welfare.

            Sec. 5-20.070       Permittee Selection Process.
 

(a)               Selection and Review of Finalists.

 

(1)               The City Council shall adopt by resolution a procedure by which the applicants applying for a medical cannabis delivery service business permit will be presented to the City Council for a final determination at a public hearing.

 

(2)               The applicants shall be invited to attend the City Council meeting, where they will be expected to make a public presentation introducing their team and providing an overview of their proposal.

(3)               At least ten (10) days prior to the hearing, notice of the hearing shall be sent to all property owners located within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed business locations of each of the finalists to be considered by the City Council.

 

(4)               The City Council shall rank the applicants in order of preference based on criteria listed in the relevant resolution and shall select one candidate to be issued a medical cannabis delivery services business permit.  The City Councils decision as to the selection of the candidate to receive the permit shall be final.

 

(5)               Official issuance of a medical cannabis delivery service business permit, however, is conditioned upon the prevailing candidate obtaining all required land use approvals.  Following the City Councils selection, the prevailing candidate shall apply to the Citys planning department to obtain any required land use approvals or entitlements for the permittees location, if any.  Land use approvals shall include compliance with all applicable provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act.  The City Manager shall formally issue a medical cannabis delivery service business permit once the City Manager and Sheriff have both affirmed that all of the required land use approvals have been obtained.

 

(6)               If the selected permittee is unable to fulfill all the requirements of obtaining the medical cannabis delivery service business permit, the City Council, in its sole discretion, may award the permit to the next highest ranked finalist, or may begin the application process again to allow for selection of a new set of finalists.

 

(7)               Issuance of a medical cannabis delivery service business permit does not create a land use entitlement.  A medical cannabis delivery service business permit shall only be for a term of twelve (12) months, and shall expire at the end of the twelve (12) month period unless it is renewed as provided herein.  Furthermore, no permittee may begin operations, notwithstanding the issuance of a permit, unless all of the state and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of this chapter and of the permit, have been complied with.

 

(8)               Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the City Council reserves the right to reject any or all applications if it determines it would be in the best interest of the City, taking into account any health, safety and welfare impacts on the community.  Applicants shall have no right to a medical cannabis delivery service business permit until a permit is actually issued, and then only for the duration of the permits term.  Each applicant assumes the risk that, at any time prior to the issuance of a permit, the City Council may terminate or delay the program created under this chapter.

 

(9)               If an application is denied, a new application may not be filed for one (1) year from the date of the denial.

 

(10)           A person or entity granted a medical cannabis delivery service business permit shall be required to pay the permit fee established by resolution of the City Council, to cover the costs of administering the medical cannabis delivery service business permit program created in this chapter.

 

(b)               Prohibition on Transfer of Medical Cannabis Delivery Service Business Permits.

 

(1)               No person may transfer ownership or control of a medical cannabis delivery service business or transfer any medical cannabis delivery service business permit issued under this Chapter.  Medical cannabis delivery service business permits are not a property right, and permittees have no economic interest in any permit issued to them.  Permittees have no right to sell or transfer a medical cannabis delivery service business permit to another party, or to have the City Council consider whether they should authorize the transfer of a medical cannabis delivery service business permit to another party.  Any attempt to transfer ownership of a medical cannabis delivery service business or of a medical cannabis delivery service business permit shall render the medical cannabis delivery service business permit void.

 

(2)               Any attempt to transfer a medical cannabis delivery service business permit or a medical cannabis delivery service business shall result in the medical cannabis delivery service business permit being declared immediately revoked and/or it is void and no longer of any effect.

 

(3)               In any situation where a permit has been lost as a result of an attempted transfer of the medical cannabis delivery service business permit or of the medical cannabis delivery service business, or as a result of the abandonment or revocation of the permit, any new permit shall be issued using the standard process for the issuance of permits in the first instance.  No preference shall be given to any person proposed as new owner or assignee by the former permit holder.  In such case, prior to accepting any new applications, the City shall post the availability of the medical cannabis delivery service business permit at issue on the Citys website.  The City Manager or his/her designee may take other actions to help ensure the broadest pool of applicants for the new permit.

            The purpose of this Division is to protect the public health, safety and welfare by establishing a fund for the maintenance of adequate public sanitary sewer facilities within the City.

 

(§1, Ord. 1119-13, eff. July 4, 2013)

 

 

            Sec. 6-7.252          Charges.
 

            Editor's Note: Rates for saltwater service fees and sewer service rates may be found in the City Offices. Rates established by City ordinances include Ord. No. 1121-13, effective July 19, 2012; Ord. No. 1138-15, effective July 1, 2015; Ord. No. 1149-16, effective July 21, 2016.

 

(a)                An applicant for a permit pursuant to Section 6-7.227 shall declare all the information necessary to comply with the provisions of this article. At the time of issuing a permit, the applicant shall pay to the City a charge, based on the additional peak flow created by the new construction, equal to the sum of Fifty ($.50) Cents per gallon per day of additional peak flow. Charges for new subdivisions or construction which does not have an existing connection to the public sewer shall be based on peak flows without credit for any existing flow. This Section 6-7.252 does not limit the City's ability to refuse to issue a permit to connect to the public sanitary sewer system.

 

(b)               All premises in the City shall be subject to an annual sewer service charge representing such premises' share of the burden placed on the sewer system, which amount shall be adopted by resolution or ordinance of the City Council in accordance with Article XIII D of the California Constitution.  In those instances where premises are not connected to the sewer system, the annual sewer charge shall reflect the burden placed on the sewer system by users of the premises who are required to use public sanitary facilities.

 

(§ 3, Ord. 1158-17, eff. June 15, 2017)

 

(c)                In the event the City has excess proceeds of taxes as defined in Article XIIIB of the California Constitution, the City Council may return a portion of the annual sewer charge as provided by Section 2 of that article. The portion of sewer charge revenue representing the amount of excess proceeds of taxes may be set aside in a special fund to be applied in the form of a credit against the sewer charges due and owing each fiscal year. The Council may, by resolution each fiscal year, establish the precise amount to be applied against the sewer charge so as to implement the return of excess proceeds to the people. In the alternative, the Council may place a measure on the City-wide ballot to adjust the City's appropriations limit as provided in Section 4 of Article XIIIB so as to use the excess proceeds for some other specified purposes.

Article 3. Private Sanitary Sewer Laterals
 

            Sec. 6-7.301          Purpose and Findings.
 

(a)                Purpose. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety and welfare by establishing regulations for the inspection, maintenance, repair, rehabilitation and replacement of private sewer laterals by property owners within the City.

 

(b)               Findings. When not properly inspected, maintained, repaired or replaced by property owners, private sewer laterals may become blocked and result in overflows of sewage from the private sewer laterals. Such sewage overflows negatively impact the public health, safety and welfare of both the property owner and the public by exposing them to untreated sewage. Such sewage overflows could also result in illicit discharges of sewage from private property to the public storm drains or waters of the United States or the State. Further, private sewer laterals that are not properly inspected, maintained, repaired or replaced by property owners can interfere with the operation of the public sewer system. Interference with the operation of the public sewer system may, in turn, cause sewage overflows from the public sewer system. Moreover, private sewer laterals that are not properly inspected, maintained, repaired or replaced by property owners may contain defects that result in the leakage of sewage from the private lateral to the ground water and ultimately to Avalon Beach. Therefore, the establishment of regulations for private sewer laterals is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare by both preventing overflows from the private laterals, interference with the operation of the public sewer system and leakage of sewage from private sewer laterals to groundwater and ultimately to Avalon Beach.

            As used in this article, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

 

            "Commercial property" shall mean all types of nongovernmental commercial uses, including hospitals, hotels, motels and rooming houses, operated within the City, including such uses located on property which is zoned "C" (commercial), "SC" (special commercial), "R/R" (resort/recreation) on the City's official Zoning Map, as it may be amended from time to time.

 

            "Common interest development" shall mean a development characterized by individual ownership of a unit or parcel coupled with the shared ownership or right to use common areas and facilities, including, but not limited to, condominium projects, community apartment projects, stock cooperatives and planned developments.

 

            "Licensed plumber" shall mean a plumbing contractor with a valid C36 contractor's license.

(a)                Property Owner's Obligation. Each property owner shall, at the property owner's expense, inspect, maintain in good working order, repair, rehabilitate and replace, as necessary, the private sewer lateral so that it does not cause or contribute to any sewage leakage or overflow from either the private sewer lateral or the public sewer. The private sewer lateral shall be free of displaced joints, open joints, root intrusion, substantial deterioration of the line, cracks, leaks, inflow, infiltration of extraneous water, fats, oils and grease, sediment deposits or any other similar conditions, defects or obstructions likely to cause or contribute to blockage of the private sewer lateral or the public sewer.

 

(b)               Private Sewer Laterals Not Part of Public Sewer System. The private sewer laterals are the property of the property owner and are not part of the public sewer.

            Sec. 6-7.413          Grease Interceptor  Variance or Waiver.
 

(a)                Variance from Grease Interceptor Requirements. A variance from the grease interceptor requirements to allow alternative pretreatment technology that is, at least, equally effective in controlling the FOG discharge in lieu of a grease interceptor may be granted to food service establishments demonstrating that it is impossible or impracticable to install, operate or maintain a grease interceptor. The City Manager's determination to grant or revoke a variance will be based on, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions:

 

(1)               There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of a grease interceptor.

 

(2)               There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor and/or between the grease interceptor and the private collection lines or the public sewer.

 

(3)               The food service establishment can justify that the alternative pretreatment technology is equivalent or better than a grease interceptor in controlling its FOG discharge. In addition, the food service establishment must be able to demonstrate, after installation of the proposed alternative pretreatment, its effectiveness to control FOG discharge through downstream visual monitoring of the sewer system, for at least three (3) months, at its own expense. A variance may be granted if the results show no visible accumulation of FOG in its lateral and/or tributary downstream sewer lines.

 

(b)               Conditional Waiver from Installation of Grease Interceptor. A conditional waiver from installation of a grease interceptor may be granted for food service establishments that have been determined to have negligible FOG discharge and insignificant impact to the sewer system. The City Manager's determination to grant or revoke a conditional waiver shall be based on, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions:

 

(1)               Quantity of FOG discharge as measured or as indicated by the size of food service establishment based on seating capacity, number of meals served, menu, water usage, amount of on-site consumption of prepared food and other conditions that may reasonably be shown to contribute to FOG discharges.

 

(2)               Adequacy of implementation of Best Management Practices and compliance history.

 

(3)               Sewer size, grade, condition based on visual information, FOG deposition in the sewer by the food service establishment, and history of maintenance and sewage spills in the receiving sewer system.

 

(4)               Changes in operations that significantly affect FOG discharge.

 

(5)               Any other condition deemed reasonably related to the generation of FOG discharges by the City Manager.

 

(c)                Application for Waiver or Variance of Requirement for Grease Interceptor.A food service establishment may submit an application and fee in an amount established by resolution of the City Council, for waiver or variance from the grease interceptor requirement to the City Manager. The food service establishment bears the burden of demonstrating, to the City Manager's reasonable satisfaction, that the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible or applicable. Upon determination by the Program Manager that reasons are sufficient to justify a variance or waiver, the permit will be issued or revised to include the variance or waiver and relieve the food service establishment from the requirement.

 

(d)               Revocation of Waiver or Variance. A waiver or variance may be revoked at any time when any term or condition for its issuance is not satisfied or if the conditions on which the waiver was based change so that the justification for the waiver or variance no longer exist.

An invoice for costs shall be delivered in accordance with Section 6-7.507 of this chapter. An invoice for costs shall be immediately due and payable to the City for the actual costs incurred by the City in issuing and enforcing any notice or order. If any owner or occupant, permittee or any other person subject to an invoice for costs fails to either pay the invoice for costs or successfully appeal the invoice for costs in accordance with Section 6-7.508, then the City Attorney may institute collection proceedings.

 

(f)                Unless timely appealed, an administrative compliance order shall be effective and final as of the date it is issued by the City Manager.

Any costs incurred by the City in obtaining and carrying out an abatement warrant or other judicial authorization may be recovered pursuant to Section 6-7.502(e).

 

a.                   Court order to enjoin or abate. At the request of the City Manager, the City Attorney may seek a court order to enjoin and/or abate the nuisance.

 

b.                  Notice to owner and occupant. Prior to seeking any court order to enjoin or abate a nuisance or threatened nuisance, the City Manager shall provide notice of the proposed injunction or abatement to the owner and occupant, if any, of the property where the nuisance or threatened nuisance is occurring.

 

(2)               Emergency Abatement. In the event the nuisance constitutes an imminent danger to public safety or the environment, the Authorized Inspector may enter the property from which the nuisance emanates, abate the nuisance and restore any property affected by the nuisance. To the extent reasonably practicable, informal notice shall be provided to the owner or occupant prior to abatement.

CHAPTER 9 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
 

 

 

Article 1. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods
 

Prior ordinance history: Ordinance No. 947-97.

 

            Sec. 6-9.101          Statutory Authorization.
 

            The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Avalon does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.

(Ord. 1120-13, eff. July 4, 2013)

 

            Sec. 6-9.102          Findings of Fact and Statement of Purpose.
 

            (a)        The flood hazard areas of the City of Avalon are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

 

            (b)        These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses.

 

            (c)        It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide (i.e. mudflow) or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:

 

            (1)        Protect human life and health;

 

            (2)        Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

 

            (3)        Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

 

            (4)        Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

 

            (5)        Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

 

            (6)        Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;

 

            (7)        Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

 

            (8)        Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

(Ord. 1120-13, eff. July 4, 2013)

 

            Sec. 6-9.103          Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.
 

            In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:

 

            (a)        Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

 

            (b)        Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

 

            (c)        Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

 

            (d)       Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage;

 

            (e)        Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

(Ord. 1120-13, eff. July 4, 2013)

            "Base flood elevation" (BFE) shall mean the elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one (1%) percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

 

            "Basement" shall mean any area of the building having its floor subgrade - i.e., below ground level - on all sides.

 

            "Breakaway walls" shall mean any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

 

            (a)        Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

 

            (b)        The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

 

            "Building" - see "Structure."

 

            "Coastal high hazard area" shall mean an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. It is an area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundation or tsunamis. The area is designated on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as Zone V1-V30, VE, or V.

 

            "Development" shall mean any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

 

            "Encroachment" shall mean the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

            "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" shall mean the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

 

"Flood, flooding, or floodwater" shall mean:

 

            (a)        A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and

 

            (b)        The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.

 

            "Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)" shall mean the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.

 

            "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" shall mean the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

 

            "Flood Insurance Study" shall mean the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

 

            "Floodplain or flood-prone area" shall mean any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source - see "Flooding."

 

            "Floodplain Administrator" shall mean the Planning Director or other community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

 

            "Floodplain management" shall mean the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.

 

            "Floodplain management regulations" shall mean this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes Federal, State or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

 

            "Floodproofing" shall mean any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.

 

            "Flood-related erosion" shall mean the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.

 

            "Flood-related erosion area" or "flood-related erosion prone area" shall mean a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.

 

            "Flood-related erosion area management" shall mean the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations.

 

            "Floodway" shall mean the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1') foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway."

 

            "Floodway fringe" shall mean that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted.

 

            "Fraud and victimization" as related to Article 6 of this chapter, shall mean that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one-hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

 

            "Functionally dependent use" shall mean a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

 

            "Governing body" shall mean the local governing unit, i.e. County or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.

 

            "Hardship" as related to Article 6 of this chapter shall mean the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

 

            "Highest adjacent grade" shall mean the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

            Sec. 6-9.401          Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.
 

            The Director of Planning is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions.

(Ord. 1120-13, eff. July 4, 2013)

 

 

            Sec. 6-9.402          Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.
 

            The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following:

 

            (a)        Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine:

 

            (1)        Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;

 

            (2)        All other required State and Federal permits have been obtained;

 

            (3)        The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

 

            (4)        The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1') foot at any point within the City of Avalon; and

 

            (5)        All Letters of Map Revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition.

 

            (6)        The cumulative value of the proposed development within the last five (5) years.

 

            (b)        Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

            (1)        Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value."

 

            (2)        Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

 

            (c)        Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 6-9.302, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal or State agency, or other source, in order to administer Article 5.

 

            NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas  A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995.

 

            (d)       Notification of Other Agencies.

 

            (1)        Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:

 

            a.         Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;

 

            b.         Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

 

            c.         Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

 

            (2)        Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations:

 

            a.         Within six (6) months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).

 

            b.         All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition.

 

            Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.

 

            (3)        Changes in corporate boundaries:

 

            Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.

 

            (e)        Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:

            (5)        Certification required by Section 6-9.506(b) (floodway encroachments);

 

            (6)        Information required by Section 6-9.507(f) (coastal construction standards); and

 

            (7)        Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

 

            (f)        Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 6-9.404.

 

            (g)        Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 6-9.303.

 

            (h)        Biennial Report. Complete and submit Biennial Report to FEMA.

 

            (i)         Planning. Assure community's General Plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein.

Article 5. Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
 

Prior ordinance history: Ordinance Nos. 947-97 and 1011-03.

 

            Sec. 6-9.501          Standards of Construction.
 

            In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:

 

            (a)        Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.

 

            (b)        Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be constructed:

 

            (1)        With flood resistant materials, and utility equipment resistant to flood damage for areas below the base flood elevation;

 

            (2)        Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;

 

            (3)        With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and

 

            (4)        Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

 

            (c)        Elevation and Floodproofing.

 

            (1)        Residential Construction. All new construction or substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement:

 

            a.         In AE, AH, Al-30 Zones, elevated to or above the base flood elevation.

 

            b.         In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two (2') feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.

 

            c.         In an A Zone, without BFE's specified on the FIRM [unnumbered A Zone], elevated to or above the base flood elevation; as determined under Section 6-9.402(c).

 

            Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

 

            (2)        Nonresidential Construction. All new construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall either be elevated to conform with Section 6-9.501(c)(1) or:

 

            a.         Be floodproofed, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below the elevation recommended under Section 6-9.501(c)(1), so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

 

            b.         Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and

 

            c.         Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect that the standards of Sections 6-9.501(c)(2) a. and b. are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

 

            (3)        Flood Openings. All new construction and substantial improvements of structures with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must meet the following minimum criteria:

            Sec. 6-9.506          Floodways.
 

            Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

 

            (a)        Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City of Avalon.

 

            (b)        Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of Avalon shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

 

            (c)        If Sections 6-9.506(a) and (b) are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 5.

            Sec. 6-9.507          Coastal High Hazard Areas.
 

            Within coastal high hazard areas, Zones V, V1-30, and VE, as established under Section 6-9.302, the following standards shall apply:

 

            (a)        All new residential and nonresidential construction, including substantial improvement/damage, shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable State or local building standards.

 

            (b)        All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide.

 

            (c)        All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls as defined in Article 2 of this chapter. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage.

 

            (d)       Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings.

 

            (e)        Manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.

 

            (f)        The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records:

 

            (1)        Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with Section 6-9.507(a); and

 

            (2)        The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement.

            Sec. 6-9.508          Mudslide (i.e., Mudflow) Prone Areas.
 

            (a)        The Floodplain Administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area.

 

            (b)        Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to:

 

            (1)        The type and quality of soils;

 

            (2)        Evidence of ground water or surface water problems;

 

            (3)        Depth and quality of any fill;

 

            (4)        Overall slope of the site; and

 

            (5)        Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope.

 

            (c)        Within areas which may have mudslide hazards, the Floodplain Administrator shall require:

 

            (1)        A site investigation and further review by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering;

 

            (2)        The proposed grading, excavation, new construction, and substantial improvement be adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages;

 

            (3)        The proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site or off-site disturbances; and

 

            (4)        Drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability.

            (a)        The Floodplain Administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas known to the community.

 

            (b)        Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion, and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard.

 

            (c)        If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard.

 

            (d)       Within Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, a setback is required for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, landscape-related stormwater management practices, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only.

Article 6. Variance Procedure
 

Prior ordinance history: Ordinance No. 947-97.

 

            Sec. 6-9.601          Nature of Variances.
 

            The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.

 

            The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

 

            It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.

(Ord. 1120-13, eff. July 4, 2013)

 

            Sec. 6-9.602          Conditions for Variances.
 

            (a)        Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Articles 4 and 5 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

 

            (b)        Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Article 2 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

 

            (c)        Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

 

            (d)       Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

 

            (e)        Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

 

            (1)        The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as Twenty-Five ($25.00) Dollars for One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars of insurance coverage, and

 

            (2)        Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the County of Los Angeles Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

 

            (f)        The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

            Sec. 6-9.603          Appeal Board.
 

            (a)        In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:

 

            (1)        Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

 

            (2)        Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

 

            (3)        Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

The City Manager or the Director may impose the following monetary penalties, in addition to other appropriate corrective action requirements:

 

            a.         An amount that shall not exceed One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars for each day a person fails or refuses to provide the City with any report or information required by this chapter;

 

            b.         An amount that shall not exceed Two Hundred ($200.00) Dollars for each day a person fails or refuses to timely comply with a Notice of Violation or Cease and Desist Order or fails or refuses to remedy any source of a continuing violation as required by the City Manager or this chapter.

            (2)        The amount of any penalties imposed under this section which have remained delinquent for a period of sixty (60) days may become a special assessment against the real property of the person violating this chapter.

 

            (3)        The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment.

 

            (4)        If the identity of the owner of the real property can be determined, the City shall make its best effort to provide notice of the special assessment to the owner by certified mail at the time of imposing the assessment. Such notice will specify that the property may be sold after three (3) years by the Tax Collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. The Tax Collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. Assessment of administrative fines as provided hereunder does not preclude assessment of other costs of abatement of any nuisance against the same property at a later date.

 

            (5)        If any real property against which the special assessment relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

 

            (6)        A sale of vacant residential developed property for which the payment of a special assessment imposed pursuant to this chapter is delinquent may be conducted, subject to the requirements applicable to the sale of property pursuant to Section 3691 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

To the extent reasonably practicable, informal notice shall be provided to the owner or occupant prior to abatement. If necessary to protect the public safety or the environment, abatement may proceed without prior notice to or consent from the owner or occupant thereof and without judicial warrant.

 

            (f)        Recovery of Costs. The Director may deliver to the owner or occupant of any property, any permittee or any other person who becomes subject to a Notice of Violation or other administrative order or to abatement or clean up activities by the City, an invoice for costs documenting any and all costs incurred by the City in cleaning up a site and issuing the Notice of Violation or other administrative order and directing payment to the City. An invoice for costs shall be delivered in accordance with Section 6-13.118 of this chapter. An invoice for costs shall be immediately due and payable to the City for the actual costs incurred by the City in issuing and enforcing any notice or order. If any owner or occupant, permittee or any other person subject to an invoice for costs fails to either pay the invoice for costs or successfully appeal the invoice for costs in accordance with Section 6-13.119 then the City Attorney may institute collection proceedings.

 

            (g)        Unless timely appealed, an administrative compliance order shall be effective and final as of the date it is issued by the City Manager.

            In the event that the excavation is performed by a public utility, the applicant may pay a fee to allow the City to complete the restoration process.

If the work is not completed to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, the Director of Public Works may do such work as may be necessary to repair such excavation and restore the street or other public place or part thereof excavated to as good condition as the same was in before such excavation was made.

            Whenever within such one (1) year warranty period any part of the work or place needs repairs, the Director of Public Works shall serve on the person by whom the excavation was made a written notice stating the repairs necessary and requiring such repairs to be made within five (5) days after the service of such notice.

 

            The City may proceed to do such work after five (5) days' notice in the event the repairs are not done to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works.  The Director of Public Works shall deduct the cost of any work done or repairs made by the City from any and all deposits then on hand. The balance of any deposit shall be returned to the depositor after the expiration of the aforementioned six (6) months from the completion of the repairs of all excavation by such depositor or after the completion of the same by the Director of Public Works assuming no further repairs are needed, whichever is longer.

In addition, an automatic sprinkler system shall be installed throughout an entire building or structure upon (1) the rehabilitation, remodeling or reconstruction of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the gross square footage of an existing commercial or multiple unit residential building or structure, whether done at one time or through successive projects approved at any time after the effective date of this Ordinance; (2) the rehabilitation, remodeling or reconstruction of fifty percent (50%) or more of the gross square footage of an existing single family dwelling, whether done at one time or through successive projects approved at any time after the effective date of this Ordinance, except where the cost of the rehabilitation, remodeling or reconstruction is $10,000 or less as determined by the Building Official using City-approved construction cost estimates; and (3) upon a change in the use of any building or structure, except in the case of a change in the use of a single family residence to use as a family day care home, in which case the provisions of Health & Safety Code section 1596 et seq. shall apply. Where a property owner constructs changes to an existing building without first obtaining permits for such work and no readily available, reliable source of information exists to verify whether the unpermitted work triggers the provisions of this Section, a rebuttable presumption that the installation of fire sprinklers is required under this Section shall arise.

ARTICLE XIV. VESTING TENTATIVE MAPS

 

            Sec. 350.       Purpose and Intent.  The purpose of this article is to establish procedures for the implementation of Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 66498.1) of Division 2 of Title 7 of the Government Code of the State of California which provides for the approval of vesting tentative maps. Except as otherwise specifically provided by this article, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to the filing, processing and review of vesting tentative maps as said term is defined by Section 66424.5 of the Government Code and Section 352 of this article.

 

            Sec. 351.       Consistency Requirement.  The approval of a vesting tentative map shall be consistent with the General Plan, any applicable specific plan, the Zoning Ordinance, and any other applicable provision of this Code in effect at the time provided by Section 358(a) of this article.

 

            Sec. 352.       Definition of Vesting Tentative Map.  A "vesting tentative map" shall mean a tentative map for a residential subdivision, as defined in this chapter, that shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map" at the time it is filed in accordance with Section 353 of this article, and is thereafter processed in accordance with the provisions of this article and the Subdivision Map Act.

 

            Sec. 353.       Application.

 

            (a)        This article shall apply only to residential subdivisions. Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act or this chapter requires the filing of a tentative map or tentative parcel map for a residential subdivision, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions of this article.

 

            (b)        If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by Chapter 4.5 of Division 2 of Title 7 of the Government Code and this article, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction.

 

            Sec. 354.       Filing and Processing.  A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form, have the same contents, and provide the same information and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in this chapter for a tentative map except as hereinafter provided:

 

            (a)        At the time a vesting tentative map is filed it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map. "

 

            (b)        The application for a vesting tentative map shall describe the manner in which the subdivision is proposed to be developed, including but not limited to the height, size and location of all buildings and other improvements.

 

            (c)        A vesting tentative map shall not be accepted for filing unless all other discretionary land use approvals required for the proposed development have been obtained or applications therefor are filed concurrently with such map.

 

            (d)       Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the Zoning Ordinance in existence at the time of filing, such inconsistency shall be noted on the map.

 

            Sec. 355.       Fees.  Upon filing a vesting tentative map, the subdivider shall pay the fees required for the filing and processing of a tentative map.

 

            Sec. 356.       Condition Precedent to Approval.  A vesting tentative map shall not be approved unless all other discretionary land use approvals required for the proposed development have been obtained.

 

            Sec. 357.       Expiration.  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same time period, and shall be subject to the same extensions, established by this chapter for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map.

 

            Sec. 358.       Vested Rights Created by Approval of Vesting Tentative Map.

 

            (a)        Subject to the time limits established by paragraph (c) of this section, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2. If Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, however, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved subject to the time limits established by paragraph (c) of this section.

 

            (b)        Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a permit, approval, extension, or entitlement may be made conditional or denied even though such action may be contrary to the ordinances, policies, and standards described in paragraph (a) if any of the following are determined:

 

            (1)        A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both.

 

            (2)        The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law.

 

            (c)        The rights referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 357 of this article. If the final map is timely approved, such rights shall exist for the following periods of time:

 

            (1)        An initial time period of one year after the recording of the final map. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded.

 

            (2)        The initial time period set forth in subparagraph (1) above shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit if such processing exceeds thirty days from the date a complete application is filed.

 

            (3)        The subdivider may apply to the Planning Commission for a one year extension at any time before the expiration of the initial time period set forth in subparagraph (c)(1) of this section. If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial to the City Council within fifteen days thereafter.

 

            (4)        If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subparagraphs (1)(3) above, the rights referred to herein shall continue to exist until the expiration of such permit, or any extension thereof.

 

            Sec. 359.       Amendment to Vesting Tentative Map.  Any time prior to the expiration of a vesting tentative map, the subdivide, or his or her assignee, may apply for an amendment to such map. A public hearing shall be held by the Planning Commission on any amendment involving a substantial modification to the subject subdivision or development related thereto. The decision by the Planning Commission on the requested amendment shall be appealable to the City Council in the manner provided by Section 6.1 of this article.

 

            Sec. 360.       Applications Inconsistent with Established Policies.  Notwithstanding any provision of this article, a property owner or his or her designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Section 358(a), and the City may grant such approvals or issue such permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law.

 

            Sec. 361.       Subsequent Permits, Licenses. and Other Entitlements for Use. The provisions of this article shall not be construed to prevent the City from conditionally approving or denying any permit, license or other entitlement for use which is applied for by the subdivider after the approval of a vesting tentative map provided such conditional approval or denial is made in accordance with the ordinances, policies and standards described in Section 358(a) of this article.

Article 2.  (LD) Low Density Residential and Low Intensity Recreation
 

Sec. 9-5.201    Intent and Purpose.
 

            The intent of the LD zone is to provide a framework to guide and control the development of the sloping, undeveloped areas surrounding the urbanized areas of Avalon. Currently, the land is very sparsely developed with residential structures. There is a high degree of public interest in this area because of the visual quality that these perimeter slopes contribute to the overall ambience of the City. Thus, regulation is intended to minimize grading and landform alteration.

 

            In reviewing and approving site plans and tract maps for the development of the area, the City Planning Commission shall be guided by the goals and policies of the General Plan, and the General Development and Use Standards specified herein.  The Commission shall not permit variance from those standards unless it finds that such variance meets the intent of the original standards. 

 

           Finally, it is intended that the LD zone will lead to the creation of an area exhibiting the following characteristics:

 

            (a)     Residential uses of various densities.

 

            (b)            Low intensity recreational uses which will increase available recreational opportunities to the public.

(Ord. 672)

 

Sec. 9-5.202    Principal Uses Permitted.
 

            (a)        Detached residential structures on slopes under thirty (30°) degrees.

 

            (b)         Outdoor recreation including, but not limited to, parks and other areas of passive recreational usage, trails, and other suitable corridors open to the public and areas for the preservation of outstanding scenic, geologic, historical and cultural value.

 

            (c)            The preservation of natural resources, including, but not limited to, areas required for preservation of plant and animal life.

(Ord. 672)

 

Sec. 9-5.203    Accessory Uses Permitted.
 

         Premises in the LD zone may be used for accessory uses provided such uses are established on the same lot or parcel of land and are incidental to and do not substantially alter the character of any permitted principal use, including, but not limited to:

 

            (a)       Accessory buildings or structures, including private garages.

 

            (b)        Domestic animals, not to exceed three (3) over three (3) months old.

(Ord. 672)

 

Sec. 9-5.204    Uses by Conditional Use Permit.
 

         Premises in the LD zone may be used for the following purposes provided a conditional use permit has first been obtained, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

 

            (a)        Detached dwelling units on slopes thirty (30°) degrees and over.

            Sec. 9-7.701   Signs  Findings and Intent.
 

            In keeping with the goals of the General Plan and the sense of place that characterizes Avalon, it is the intent of this chapter to control the design, quality of materials, construction, illumination, size, location and maintenance of signs and sign structures.  Due to its unique and special aesthetic and safety problems occasioned by its geographical size and location, the width and design of its streets, the number of pedestrians, and the limited availability of space for signs, the City has determined that the health, welfare, and safety of its inhabitants requires special rules and regulations to govern the size, number and classes of signs used upon property under its jurisdiction. These regulations are intended to encourage signs that are compatible with the architectural style, characteristics and scale that are historically appropriate as well as being compatible with the building to which they are attached, adjacent buildings, and the surrounding neighborhood. In furtherance thereof, and in order to provide and maintain accurate and complete records and information upon which further appropriate rules and regulations may be determined, the provisions of this chapter are enacted.

Article 10. Antennas*
 

 

*Editor's Note: Ordinance No. 940-96 renumbered former Section 9-6.602, regulating satellite dish antenna to Chapter 7 of Title 9 and creating Article 10, Antennas. Prior ordinance history include portions of Ordinance Nos. 802U, 803 and 925-96.

 

 

            Sec. 9-7.1001     Definitions Applicable to Antenna Regulations.
 

            The following words and phrases, as used in this chapter, are defined as follows:

 

(a)               "Antenna" shall mean an accessory structure, regardless of how mounted, designed and/or used, which is capable of transmitting or receiving electro-magnetic, cellular, microwave and other signals.

 

(b)               "Directional transmitting antenna" shall mean an antenna with vertical and horizontal support poles and extensions, including a mounting equipment.

 

(c)               "Video programming antenna/nonrestricted" shall mean either (1) a dish antenna measuring less than thirty-nine (39") inches in diameter designed or used to receive video programming signals from direct broadcast satellites (DBS); or (2) an antenna measuring thirty-nine (39") inches or less in diameter and having a mast measuring less than twelve (12') feet, that is designed or used to receive video programming signals from multi-channel multipoint distribution systems (MMDS/wireless cable) or television broadcast stations (TVBS).

 

(d)               "Reasonable functional use" shall mean that positioning of an antenna to permit a substantially unobstructed line-of-sight with satellites in geosynchronous orbit, or other transmitting devices, from which the antenna receives signals.

 

(e)               "Whip antenna" shall mean a single shaft antenna, including all mounting equipment.

 

(§6, Ord. 940-96, eff. January 17, 1997)

 

 

            Sec. 9-7.1002     Permitting Requirements and Development Standards for Specific Antennas.
 

            The following permitting requirements and development standards shall apply to the installation of specific antennas:

 

(a)               Video Programming Antennas.

 

(1)               No Permit Required. Any person may install, use and maintain video programming antennas/nonrestricted, as defined herein, on property which such person directly owns, without the necessity of applying for a permit. Within fifteen (15) days of installation, the property owner shall notify the Planning Department, by telephone or in writing, of the installation. The property owner may, but is not required to, notify the Planning Department of a planned installation. On receipt of the notification, the Planning Director may inspect the location solely for the purpose of determining whether the proposed or actual antenna installation is or will be placed in a location that will reduce or eliminate its visibility from the street, unless the antenna is not or cannot be so placed without impacting signal quality. The Planning Department shall inform the City Building Official of the installation. The Building Official shall promulgate and make available to the public specific safety regulations for antenna installation, including but not limited to placement for fire safety, avoidance of utility lines, and grounding and installation stability requirements. Once such regulations are promulgated, the Building Official may inspect an installation solely for the purpose of determining that it complies with same. The property owner shall comply with orders issued by the Building Official concerning correction of unsafe installations.

 

(2)               Permit Required. Any proposed installation of a video programming antenna which does not fall within the definition set forth in Section 9-7.1001(c) because of size shall require site plan approval and a height variance, if applicable.

 

(k)               Application requirements. Where site plan approval is required, the application shall include a site plan showing the proposed installation location, property and setback lines, and other site specific information and details necessary for the City to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The Planning Director and/or Commission may require supplemental information to be filed with the site plan as it deems appropriate. Where a height variance is required, the application shall include elevation drawings.

 

(3)               Development Standards. A video programming antenna that falls outside of the definition of "video programming antenna/nonrestricted" may be placed on private property within all land use zones of the City, subject to the following development standards:

 

(i)                 Quantity. Only one (1) receive-only dish antenna may be installed per lot, parcel, multiple-family residential complex or building, whichever interpretation results in the fewest dish antennas.

 

(ii)              Installation requirements. Installation shall be in a location which limits visibility of the antenna from the street or neighboring properties unless the Planning Commission determines that any other location will unreasonably interfere with signal reception. The Planning Commission may require that visible antenna by painted to blend into the background against which it is mounted.

 

(b)               Whip Transmitting, Directional Transmitting Antennas. The Planning Director may administratively approve the installation of (i) omni-directional "whip" transmitting antennas measuring no more than ten (10') feet in length and two (2") inches in diameter; (ii) directional transmitting antennas having support poles measuring no more than ten (10') feet in length and two (2") inches in diameter and extensions that do not exceed two (2') feet in length and two (2") inches in diameter, provided that an installation specified in subsections (i) or (ii) which exceeds applicable development standard(s) for the zone shall require a variance.

 

(c)               Other Transmitting Antennas. Except as provided above, one transmitting antenna or antennas, whether dish or otherwise, may be installed per lot, parcel or on a building only within the public or low density residential zone subject to a conditional use permit, site plan approval, and variances, if any are required under the development standards applicable within the zone. In addition to providing the information and plans required by subsection (a)(2) above, the applicant for a conditional use permit shall submit microwave interference and radiation data and specifications, and all other information required to be filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in support of the required application for an FCC license and any other plans and information the City deems relevant. In addition to notice of hearing required by law, notice of a public hearing on a conditional use permit for installation of a transmitting antenna in a low density residential zone or a public zone or within three hundred (300') feet of the boundary of such zones shall be given to each property owner within a one thousand (1,000') foot radius of the antenna.

 

(1)               In addition to the principles and standards set forth in Sections 9-8.303 and 9-8.404, the Commission shall consider the application and may, with such conditions as are deemed necessary, approve a conditional use permit for a transmitting antenna only after consideration of the following additional factors:

 

(i)                 If the applicant proposes to install the transmitting antenna in the zones specified above, the aesthetic, visual and safety impacts on developed and undeveloped parcels within a one thousand (1,000') foot radius of the site;

 

(ii)              The availability of other, more appropriate sites, taking into account the zoning of the proposed site, including existing and reasonably foreseeable future development, the comparative advantages of the alternative site and the proposed site in terms of sound quality and signal reach, and the diligence of the applicant in identifying and qualifying for such alternative sites that would have less negative impacts than the proposed site;

 

(iii)            The visual and aesthetic impacts of the proposed antenna installation when viewed from scenic areas of the City of Avalon, taking into account the existence of other antennas, towers and similar structures within the same view frame.

Article 10A. Temporary Use Permits
 

 

            Sec. 9-7.10A01    Temporary Use Permits. 
 

(a)               Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to regulate land use activities of a temporary nature so as to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.  The intent of these regulations is to encourage development within the City Center Area, to ensure that temporary uses will be compatible with surrounding land uses, to protect the rights of adjacent residents and land owners, to minimize any adverse effects on surrounding properties and the environment, and to ensure that the temporary use is removed in a timely manner and the site restored to its original condition.

 

(b)               Uses Allowed by Temporary Use Permit. A temporary use permit may be issued for any use that is not permitted in a particular zone, but that is otherwise consistent with the general purposes of the General Plan, consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of the surrounding community, and that is of a specific and limited duration. A temporary use as which does not have a valid and current temporary use permit, and which is not otherwise a permitted use in the zone, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, subject to the enforcement provisions of the Municipal Code and other applicable laws.

 

(c)               Temporary Use Permits for Construction.  In addition to the uses authorized above, the uses for which a temporary use permit may issue include, but are not limited to, the following:

 

(1)         Construction Staging Areas, which shall mean the temporary use of property by a licensed contractor engaged in a permitted construction project for storage of construction equipment and materials, only for the duration of the construction project.

 

(2)         Stockpiling, which shall mean the temporary storage of clean dirt, sand, gravel, or similar non-polluting materials for a limited period of time, on a property where such material is not proposed to be used for construction activities.

 

(3)         Temporary Structures for Specific Uses and Time Periods.  Such structures may include manufactured or modular buildings, trailer coaches, self-contained recreational vehicles, or similar temporary facilities for uses including the following:

 

a.             Temporary construction offices serving active construction sites;

 

b.            Tanks, pumps and similar structures for groundwater quality remediation; and

 

c.             Temporary storage containers serving active construction sites only.

 

(d)               General Provisions.

 

(1)               The City Manager may approve, conditionally approve or deny a permit for a temporary use, and may establish conditions and limitations, including but not limited to hours of operation, provision of parking areas, signs, lighting, traffic circulation and access, temporary or permanent site improvements, noise control, sanitary facilities, refuse collection and disposal, fire protection, provision of utilities, and other measures necessary to minimize potential effects on properties adjacent to or in the vicinity of the proposed temporary use.

 

(2)               The City may require a cash deposit or other security as approved by the City Attorney to defray costs related to the permit or the use, including but not limited to potential costs for the cleanup of the site by the City, in the event the applicant fails to leave the property in a presentable and satisfactory condition, or potential costs to guarantee removal and/or conversion of any temporary use.

 

(3)               The temporary use permit shall identify its expiration date, which shall be the date that the use is reasonably expected to terminate.  Upon issuance of a temporary use permit, the City Manager shall immediately notify the City Council and put notice of the issuance of the temporary use permit on the Citys website. The expiration date shall not be beyond one (1) year from the date of issuance, unless good cause is shown. The City Manager may approve or conditionally approve an extension of a temporary use permit, provided that there is good cause for the extension. The City Council shall consider any issuance or extension of a temporary use permit that goes beyond two (2) years. Notwithstanding the expiration date, temporary use permits shall automatically terminate upon the abandonment or termination of the temporary use.

 

(4)               If the temporary use permit is related to construction, then the permit shall identify the site upon which the construction is proceeding. The temporary use permit shall automatically expire within thirty (30) days of completion of construction. For purposes of this section, completion shall have the same meaning as in Section 8180 of the California Civil Code, as amended from time to time.

 

Unless otherwise specified by an approved temporary use permit, all sites for temporary uses shall be cleaned of trash, debris and any temporary structures prior to expiration of the permit.

 

(5)               Temporary use permits shall not run with the land. A change in ownership or operator of a use or structure subject to a temporary use permit, as specified in this section, or an approved change or modification to the structure or use allowed on a parcel subject to such a permit, shall not affect the time periods established by this section which allow such temporary uses or structures.

 

(e)               Application Procedure.  A request for a temporary use permit shall be submitted to the Planning Department on a form provided for that purpose by the Planning Department, along with the required fee established by resolution of the City Council.   The City Manager may require additional information where deemed necessary to complete the Citys review and evaluation. 

 

(f)                Approval Authority.  The reviewing authority for temporary use permits shall be the City Manager.  In approving any temporary use permit application, the City Manager shall make all of the following findings:

 

(1)               The use is consistent with the general purposes of the General Plan and this section.

 

(2)               Appropriate measures have been taken to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare to minimize detrimental effects on adjacent properties.

 

(3)               The operation and maintenance of the use will be conducted so as to minimize the impact on existing uses on adjoining properties and in the surrounding area.

 

(4)               The temporary use will have adequate parking, ingress and egress, traffic circulation and access, and provisions for pedestrian safety.

 

(5)               All structures and equipment are erected and maintained in compliance with the Municipal Code.

 

(6)               The subject site will be restored to its original or better condition upon termination of the temporary use.

 

(7)               The temporary use is not detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare and has specific identifiable benefits to the City of Avalon and its residents.

 

(g)               Appeals. The reviewing authoritys decision on a temporary use permit shall become final ten (10) days after notice of the action is given to the applicant. The applicant may appeal to the City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk prior to the decision becoming final. The decision of the City Council shall be final.

 

(h)               Violations and Revocation.

 

(1)               The provisions of Sections 9-8.1001 and 9-8.1101 shall apply to temporary use permits issued under this section.

 

(2)               Any temporary use permit is subject to revocation if the use is being conducted in violation of the Municipal Code, the terms and conditions of such permit or otherwise in violation of the law, or if the temporary use permit was obtained by fraud. A notice of revocation shall provide the holder of the permit with the opportunity for a hearing prior to revocation. Failure to request a hearing within the time stated in the notice of revocation shall render the revocation final. If requested, the hearing shall be before the City Manager whose decision shall be final.

            (b)        Every use, development of land and application of development standards shall be considered on the basis of the suitability of the site for the particular use or development in-tended, and the total development, including the application of prescribed development standards, shall be so arranged as to avoid traffic congestion, insure the protection of public health, safety and general welfare, prevent adverse effects on neighboring property and shall be in general accord with all elements of the General Plan.

 

            (c)        Every use, development of land, application of development standards shall be considered on the basis of suitable and functional development design, but is not intended that such approval be interpreted to require a particular style or type of architecture.

Sec. 9-8.404    Basis for Approval or Denial of a Conditional Use Permit.
 

            The Commission shall consider applications for a conditional use permit and may, with such conditions as are deemed necessary, approve a conditional use which will not jeopardize, adversely affect, endanger or otherwise constitute a menace to the public health, safety or general welfare, or be materially detrimental to the property of other persons located in the vicinity of such use.

 

            (a)        In making such determination, the Commission shall find that the proposed use is in general accord with the following principles and standards:

 

            (1)        The proposed conditional use shall conform with and carry out the certified Land Use Plan for the area.

 

            (2)        The nature, condition, and development of adjacent uses, buildings and structures shall be considered and no proposed conditional use shall be permitted where such use will adversely affect or be materially detrimental to said adjacent uses, buildings and structures.

 

            (3)        The site for a proposed conditional use shall be adequate in size and shape to accommodate the yards, walls, fences, parking and loading facilities, landscaping and other development features prescribed in this chapter or as required as a condition in order to integrate said use with the uses in the neighborhood.

 

            (4)        The site for a proposed conditional use shall be served by highways and streets adequate in width and improved as necessary to carry the kind and quantity of traffic such use would generate.

 

            (5)        The proposed conditional use shall be consistent with and carry out the purpose and intent of the underlying zone.

 

            (b)        Conditions imposed by the Commission for a conditional use may involve any pertinent factors affecting the establishment, operation and maintenance of the requested use, including, but not limited to:

 

            (1)        Special yards, open spaces and buffer areas.

 

            (2)        Fences and walls.

 

            (3)        Parking facilities, including vehicular ingress and egress and the surfacing of parking area and driveways to specified standards.

 

            (4)        Street and highway dedications and improvements including sidewalks, curbs and gutters.

 

            (5)        Water supply and fire protection.

 

            (6)        Landscaping and maintenance of ground.

 

            (7)        Regulation of nuisance factors such as noise, vibrations, smoke, dust, dirt, odors, gases, noxious matter, heat, glare, electromagnetic disturbances and radiation.

 

            (8)        Regulation of operating hours for activities affecting normal neighbor-hood schedules and functions.

 

            (9)        Regulation of signs, including outdoor advertising.

 

            (10)      A specified validation period limiting the time in which development may begin.

 

            (11)      Provisions for a bond or other surety that the proposed conditional use will be removed on or before a specified date.

 

            (12)      A site plan indicating all details and data as prescribed in this chapter subject to the provisions of Chapter 8, Article 2 (Site Plan Review).

 

            (13)      Such other conditions as will make possible the development of the pro-posed conditional use in an orderly and efficient manner and in general accord with all elements of the General Plan and the intent and purpose of this chapter.

 

            (c)        The Commission shall deny the requested conditional use permit where the findings indicate, and the Commission determines, that the applicant has failed to show that the requested use will not jeopardize, adversely affect, endanger or otherwise constitute a menace to the public health, safety or general welfare or be materially detrimental to the property of other persons located in the vicinity of such use, and reasonable restrictions or conditions to permit the establishment of the proposed use will not prevent detriment or menace as indicated, and that the use is not consistent with the purpose and intent of the underlying zone and does not carry out the Land Use Plan.

 

            (d)       Additional Considerations for Transient Rental Use. In addition to the foregoing, the Planning Commission shall consider the following in connection with an application for a conditional use permit for transient rental use:

 

            (1)        Year-Round Rental Status. In the absence of adequate mitigating measures proposed by the applicant, the application should be denied where the subject property is or has been rented for periods of more than thirty (30) consecutive days to the same occupant at any time during the two (2) years preceding the application.

 

            (2)        Neighborhood Impacts. The Planning Commission shall consider the objections of the owners and occupants of neighboring properties in determining whether the proposed use is consistent with the surrounding properties and the extent to which such impacts may be mitigated by the imposition of the standard conditions listed below or by the imposition of additional conditions. The Planning Commission may consider objections previously made in connection with applications for transient rental use at other properties located within the same general area as the subject application; however, the Planning Commission should consider the time between the prior application and the subject application, the geographical proximity of the subject application to the prior application, any differing circumstances, and additional mitigating measures proposed by the applicant, and changes in the general area, in determining the weight to be given such prior objections.

 

            (3)        Single- and Multiple-Unit Properties. In the absence of other negative findings, (a) where the property is the only unit owned by the applicant in the City and the applicant proposes to use the property himself from time to time; or (b) where the subject property contains multiple units or the applicant owns other separate properties in the City of Avalon which are utilized for year-round rental, the Planning Commission should approve the application.

 

            (4)        Condominium Associations Having Ten (10) or More Units. In the case of an application concerning property located within a condominium or similar congregate housing project consisting of ten (10) or more units, the applicant shall be required to demonstrate that (1) the subject property is not or has not been rented for periods of more than thirty (30) consecutive days to the same occupant at any time during the two (2) years preceding the application; and (2) that any governing body of the subject association generally allows transient uses at the condominium or congregated housing project.

 

            (5)        The Planning Commission shall consider whether granting the Conditional Use Permit shall result in any year round residence located adjacent to the proposed transient rental having more than a majority of the adjacent residences permitted for transient use. "Adjacent" means having a common property line with the proposed transient rental unit except for the existence of a public street or alley.

 

            (6)        The total square footage of the dwelling unit and the site of each bedroom shall be considered for determining whether to grant the conditional use permit.

 

            (e)        Conditions to be Imposed Upon Conditional Use Permits for Transient Rental. The Planning Commission shall impose as a condition all of the requirements and standards set forth in subsection (f), plus such additional conditions which the Planning Commission determines are appropriate to mitigate the impacts of such use.

 

            (f)        Requirements and Standards Applicable to All Transient Rentals. The following requirements shall apply to all properties used for transient rental:

 

            (1)        Registration, Inspection and Licensing Requirements.

 

            a.         Any managing agency, agent, owner or property manager who rents one (1) or more transient private home rental units shall be required to obtain a City business license. Failure to obtain a business license or continuing to operate a transient rental after revocation of a business license constitutes an infraction pursuant to Section 1-2.01(b) of the Municipal Code, and may result in imposition of a fine upon conviction among other penalties.

 

            All transient rentals shall be subject to collection of transient occupancy tax as required by the Municipal Code, and each managing agency, agent, owner and property manager of a transient rental shall collect and make payment to the City of the transient occupancy tax for their transient rental.

 

            (2)        Sign Requirements.

 

            a.         Sign Requirements. Each transient rental unit shall have posted in a location that is clearly visible from the outside of the property one (1) sign with the contents set forth below. The sign shall either be purchased at a reasonable cost through the City of Avalon Planning Department or consistent with a template provided by the City. The sign shall be made of material which affixes to a window, not to exceed two (2) square feet in size, have lettering of sufficient size to be easily read from a place accessible to the public, and shall clearly contain the following information:

 

            (i)         Street address of the transient rental unit.

 

            (ii)        Allowed maximum occupancy for the transient rental unit.

 

            (iii)       Name of the managing agency, agent, property manager, or owner of the unit, and a local telephone number at which that party or his agent may be reached on a 24-hour basis.

 

            (3)        Advertising Requirements. Any sign advertising the available use of a transient rental unit must meet all of the advertising and sign requirements found in the Avalon Municipal Code.

 

            (4)        Notice and Rental Agreement Requirements. Each transient rental unit shall have a clearly visible and legible notice posted within the unit on or adjacent to the front door, containing the following information:

 

            a.         The name of the managing agency, agent, property manager, or owner of the unit, and a local telephone number at which that party or his agent may be reached on a 24-hour basis;

 

            b.         The maximum number of occupants permitted to stay in the unit;

 

            c.         Notification that trash and refuse shall not be left or stored on the property, the scheduled dates and times for pick-up at the location, and an explanation of the City's recycling program;

 

            d.         Notification that failure to conform to the parking and occupancy requirements of the structure is a violation of this section;

 

            e.         When the City has enacted water conservancy measures by ordinance, notice of the requirements of such ordinance and a request that occupants conserve water as much as possible in the use of showers, baths, faucets and laundry.

 

            f.          Notification that use of unenclosed decks and patios between 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. is prohibited where such use generates noise which would disturb or annoy a reasonable person occupying the adjacent properties.

 

            g.         A statement that Avalon has a "zero tolerance" policy towards nuisances, rowdy and disruptive behavior and advising that the occupancy will be immediately terminated for violations of this policy.

 

            The foregoing information shall be stated in the rental information and agreement provided to prospective renters prior to their occupancy of the unit.

 

            (5)        Vehicles. Off-street parking shall be provided on or off site such that all vehicles bearing permits issued for the unit can be parked off street, except when used pursuant to a temporary permit issued to the owner as provided in Title 4. The owner, agent and managing agency shall comply with the Avalon vehicle ordinance which (1) permits transient renters to only use the vehicle which is permitted for the location; and (2) prohibits the owner, agent or managing agency from charging for the use of the vehicle, except:

 

            a.         Properties located in the "flats" (as defined in Section 9-5.406) and properties located in the condominium known as "Bahia Vista," "Canyon Terrace," and "Sol Vista" shall not include a vehicle to be used by transient guests.

 

            (6)        Trash. The owner or managing agent shall provide written information to each transient occupant setting out the schedule for trash pick-up at the location and an explanation of the City's recycling program and ensure that there are adequate materials for disposing of trash in accordance with the City's program. All trash containers shall be secured against animal incursion.

 

            (7)        Maximum Occupancy. The maximum occupancy for transient rentals shall be two (2) persons (including children and infants) per bedroom, plus two (2); provided the Planning Commission in its discretion may establish a different maximum number where appropriate and reasonable to permit fewer persons that the foregoing formula might otherwise allow and may also increase the number that would otherwise be allowed under the foregoing formula where facts are presented demonstrating that the configuration of the property warrants it. Reasons for establishing a different maximum occupancy number include but are not limited to:

 

            a.         Size and location of the property.

 

            b.         Distinction between single- and multi-unit properties.

 

            c.         Number and size of each sleeping room in the transient rental unit.

 

            (8)        Unenclosed areas. The use of unenclosed areas, such as decks and balconies, attached to each transient rental unit shall be prohibited between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. Monday through Sunday.

 

            (9)        Code Compliance, Fire Safety and Inspection. Each dwelling unit used for transient rental within the City is subject to all of the following inspection requirements:

 

            a.         The owner shall be responsible for compliance with all codes regarding Fire, Building and Safety, Health and Safety and other relevant laws and the requirements of paragraph (9) h. of this section.

 

            b.         Any transient rental unit which was permitted or legally nonconforming and in existence prior to the effective date of this subsection shall be made available for inspection within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this subsection. The City shall endeavor to inspect all such units within one hundred eighty (180) days of the effective date of this subsection. The Planning Department shall coordinate with the property owner and the inspectors to arrange for reasonable notice and the date of inspection. Within fifteen (15) days following inspection, the inspectors shall submit an original, signed inspection report to the Planning Department, or, where applicable, provide notice that the property owner has unreasonably prevented inspection. Failure to cooperate with the scheduling of the inspection shall subject the approval to use the unit as a transient private home rental to revocation. Any new transient rental unit established after the effective date of this subsection shall be inspected prior to commencement of the use, which inspection shall be scheduled and conducted within thirty (30) days of approval. In addition to the registration for each unit as required in Section 9-8.404(f)(1) above, an original, signed inspection report for each unit shall be submitted to the Business License Representative in order to obtain approval to use the unit as a transient rental.

 

            c.         Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified inspector(s) authorized and approved by the City to conduct such inspections. Inspectors shall demonstrate appropriate qualifications to conduct the required inspections as determined by the Building Official or the Fire Department, as applicable. The cost of such inspections, plus any administrative charges shall be paid by the owner pursuant to the City's adopted fee schedule. The City shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that inspections are completed in a timely manner.

 

            d.         After the initial inspection, each rental unit shall be reinspected no less than once every three (3) years following the original inspection. Verification of inspection will be done at the time of business license renewal. Failure to submit inspection reports shall result in revocation of approval to use the unit for transient rentals.

 

            e.         Inspections shall verify compliance with all applicable provisions of this section.

 

            f.          If upon completing an inspection of a transient rental, the inspector(s) determines that the unit is not in conformance with this section, the inspector shall provide the managing agency, agent, owner or property manager with a list of required corrections, set a reasonable time for correction and a date for reinspection. A copy of the foregoing shall also be given to the Planning Department. If the unit is registered with the City as a transient rental, approval by the City to use the unit for transient rental shall be suspended until correction and reinspection if determined by the inspector to present an immediate health and safety hazard, and submission of a new inspection report for the unit indicating compliance with this section. If the unit is not yet registered with or approved by the City, approval for its use as a transient rental shall be withheld until submission of a new inspection report for the unit indicating compliance with this section.

 

            g.         Noncompliance by an owner, managing agency, property manager or agent of the requirements for registration, inspection and operation of transient private home rentals may result in the revocation of the business license and conditional use permit authorizing the use, and upon revocation, no new business license or conditional use permit may be issued to the same transient rental licensee for a period of twelve (12) months following such revocation.

 

            h.         The following requirements for transient rentals will be evaluated upon inspection of each unit, and shall constitute minimum requirements. The unit must be brought into conformance with these requirements and any other applicable codes and ordinances in order for the use to be allowed.

 

            1.         Required sign and notice must be posted, and address of unit must be legible from outside the property unless exempted.

 

            2.         Smoke detectors shall be installed within each sleeping room and at a point centrally located in the corridor or area giving access to each separate sleeping room.

Sec. 9-8.405    Basis for Approval or Denial of a Variance.
 

            The Commission may grant a variance, with such conditions as are deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. Variances from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance shall be granted only when, because of special circumstances applicable to the property including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of the Zoning Ordinance deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification.

 

            Any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which such property is situated.

 

            A variance shall not be granted for a parcel of property which authorizes a use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the zone regulation governing the parcel of property. No variances shall be granted which reduce or adversely affect access to or along the shoreline, including physical or visual qualities of access. The variance shall be consistent with the Local Coastal Program. Conditions imposed by the Commission for a variance may involve any pertinent factors affecting the establishment, operation or maintenance of the requested use, including, but not limited to:

 

            (a)        Granting a variance for a limited time only.

 

            (b)        Granting for a limited time only, an expansion or extension of a previously granted variance or a nonconforming use, on condition that at the end of such time such prior variance or nonconforming use shall also terminate and the property shall thereafter be used for such purposes as are permitted in the zone in which such property is located.

 

            (c)        That certain uses, where authorized by the variance or lawful without such variance, be confined to designated portions of the property or to designated days, or designated times in a day.

 

            (d)       That certain uses, even if lawful without the granting of the variance, not be made of the property.

 

            (e)        That certain uses, where lawful without the granting of the variance, be not made of the property unless and until certain conditions exist.

Sec. 9-8.409    Assurance of Faithful Performance of Imposed Conditions.
 

            Whenever the Commission grants or modifies a variance or conditional use permit and the grant or modification of said variance or conditional use permit is subject to one or more conditions, the Commission may require that the applicant or the owner of the property to which such variance or conditional use permit applies, file with the City Clerk a surety bond, or a corporate surety bond, or a deposit of money, or savings and loan certificates or shares in an amount prescribed and for the purpose of guaranteeing the faithful performance of said conditions.

(Ord. 672)

 

Sec. 9-8.410    Expiration Time for a Variance or Conditional Use Permit.
 

            A variance or conditional use permit which is not used within the time specified in said permit, or if no time is specified within thirty-six (36) months after the granting of the re-quest shall terminate. Such termination shall take effect without further City action if a timely request for an extension of time has not been made or is denied. Any interruption or cessation of the permitted activity that is beyond the control of the property owner shall not result in the termination of such right or privilege.

 

            Upon written request submitted not less than thirty (30) days prior to termination of the approval, the Planning Commission may grant one (1) six (6) month extension of such right or privilege but only upon a finding that changed circumstances peculiar to the applicant have resulted in delays beyond the applicant's control, and that the grant of the extension would not be contrary to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. The City Council may grant one (1) additional extension of not more than six (6) months upon a finding that changed circum-stances peculiar to the applicant have resulted in delays beyond the applicant's control, and that the grant of the extension would not be contrary to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.

 

            Notice of hearing on any requested extension shall be given to any person who re-quests notice at or after the hearing on the original grant of the approval.

            The Commission on their own motion, or if instructed by the City Council, without the filing of an application, may revoke or modify any previously granted variance, conditional use permit, or nonconforming use after a public hearing if the Commission finds:

            (a)        That the conditions of the improvement, if any, on the property are such that to require the property to be utilized only for those uses permitted in the zone where it is located would not impair the constitutional rights of any person, or

 

            (b)        That the nature of said improvements is such that they can be altered so as to be used in conformity with the uses permitted in the zone in which such property is located without impairing the constitutional rights of any person.

            (b)        Termination by Discontinuance.

 

            (1)        Discontinuance of a nonconforming use as indicated herein shall immediately terminate the right to operate such nonconforming use, except when extended as otherwise provided in this title.

            The following regulations shall apply to all buildings and structures which are nonconforming as a result of development standards adopted in this title.

 

            (a)        A nonconforming building or structure may be continuously maintained pro-vided there is no alteration, addition or enlargement of any area, space or volume of the structure, except for the following:

 

            (1)        The alteration is required by other applicable law;

 

            (2)        The alteration will result in the elimination of the nonconforming conditions; or

 

            (3)        The alteration consists of a minor improvement, repair, modification, or remodeling which does not increase the degree of nonconformity present. Any new structure incidental to the nonconforming building or structure is deemed to be an expansion under this section.

 

            (4)        The premises are located on a lot which is less than two thousand two hundred (2,200) square feet and in the area depicted in Appendix A, the nonconformity relates to parking, setbacks or height and the alteration or improvement results in an increase of less than fifty (50%) percent of the square footage of the existing or previously existing structure. For all other premises, the nonconformity relates to parking or setbacks and the alteration or improvement results in an increase of seventy (70) square feet or less.

 

            (b)        Buildings or structures damaged or destroyed by fire, flood or other natural disasters may be rebuilt to their preexisting setbacks, sizes, floor area ratios and densities or legal nonconformities with the development standards established by this Title as long as there is no increase in the nonconformity from that which existed prior to the buildings or structures' damage or destruction.

 

            (c)        A building or structure that is located in a residential zone and is nonconforming as to density may maintain the nonconforming density and be permitted to seek approval to alter, add to or enlarge area, space or volume of the structure, but only when all of the following apply:

 

            (1)        The nonconforming density is no more than one (1) unit above the number of units that would be permitted under current zoning regulations, including therewith density bonus units;

 

            (2)        The alteration, addition or enlargement does not increase the existing degree of nonconformity as to any development standard other than density, such as height, floor to lot ration, setbacks, lot coverage, parking, or the provision of trash storage, unless a variance is applied and granted therefor.

 

            (3)        The owner enters into a recorded agreement approved by the City Attorney restricting the use of the nonconforming units to year round housing for a period of fifteen (15) years from the date of the issuance of a building permit for the alteration, addition or enlargement.

 

            (4)        The nonconforming unit has existed for at least five (5) years before July 1, 2006, as reflected by records in the Los Angeles County Assessor's, records of the City Finance Office for payment of salt, sewer and/or trash fees or similar documentation which, the determination of the Planning Commission confirms the existence of the unit for the required time period.

CHAPTER 11 - AFFORDABLE HOUSING*
 

 

            Sec. 9-11.101        Purpose.
 

            The purpose of this chapter is to:

 

            (a)        Foster realization of the goals of the community vision elaborated in the Avalon 2020 Vision as adopted by resolution of the City Council on August 14, 2003. The Avalon 2020 Vision was drafted by a working group of Avalon citizens after numerous community meetings, focus groups, and surveys and embodies the statement of policy pursuant to which the comprehensive, long-term plans for the development of Avalon shall be formulated and measured. With regard to housing, the Avalon 2020 Vision states as a goal that "residents have access to dignified, affordable housing."

 

            (b)        Encourage the availability of dignified, safe, and affordable workforce housing within the City of Avalon by promoting development of decent living environments and removing unnecessary barriers to such development in order to increase the opportunities for dignified, safe, and affordable housing for lower-, moderate-, and middle-income households, as well as households with special needs, and to thereby implement the housing policies articulated in the Housing Element of the General Plan.

 

            (c)        Assist in the development of affordable home ownership opportunities for lower-, moderate-, and middle-income residents.

(§9-11.101, Ord. 1092-10, eff. May 20, 2010)

 

 

*Editor's Note: Prior ordinance history includes portions of Ordinance Nos. 672, 742, 840, 1018 and 1061-07.

 

            Sec 9-11.102         Findings.
 

            The City of Avalon finds that:

 

            (a)        Both California and the City face a serious housing problem that threatens their economic security. Lack of access to workforce housing has a direct impact on the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City. The City will not be able to contribute to the attainment of State housing goals or to retain a healthy environment without additional affordable housing. The house problem has an impact upon a broad range of income groups including many who are not impoverished by standards other than those found in California's and the City's housing markets, and no single housing program will be sufficient to meet the housing need.

 

            (b)        Without assistance from government, there exists within the City a shortage of workforce housing that is affordable (either for rental or purchase) to persons of lower, moderate, and middle income. While Federal and State money and programs continue to assist in meeting the housing needs of lower- and moderate-income groups, middle-income housing is not eligible for this money or programs.

 

            (c)        Strong demand for second (vacation) homes has helped push the purchase price of a home in the City beyond the reach of much of the local workforce, including middle-income households.

 

            (d)       Home ownership helps foster a stable middle income population that strengthens and benefits the community economically and socially. Rapid rises in real property and development costs have eliminated affordable housing for the middle class in the City. Teachers, firefighters, managers, medical professionals, and others considered as middle class can no longer afford to purchase a modest home. The percentage of local residents who own their homes has declined in the past twenty (20) years from thirty-three (33%) percent to twenty-five (25%) percent.

 

            (e)        There is a need to develop housing removed from the speculative real estate market by imposing various restrictions designed to ensure that it is owned and lived in by local workers and remains in the affordable housing pool when sold.

 

            (f)        Development of new commercial projects and market-rate housing encourages new residents to move to the City. These residents, together with other commercial projects, will place demands on services provided by both the public and private sectors. Some of the public and private sector employees needed to meet the needs of the new residents or commercial developments earn incomes only adequate to pay for affordable housing. Because affordable housing is in short supply within the City, these employees may be forced to live in less than adequate housing within the City or pay a disproportionate share of their incomes to live in adequate housing. These circumstances harm the City's ability to attain goals articulated in the City's General Plan and strain the City's ability to accept and service new market-rate housing development or commercial projects.

 

            (g)        If new development is solely created for higher income, second home ownership, it will exacerbate the work force housing shortage and reduce the limited supply of water and developable land that is available for affordable workforce housing within the City.

 

            (h)        The requirement to provide affordable housing in new projects will serve and important public purpose and help mitigate the impacts of such development on the affordable housing shortage. Inclusionary housing policies continue to a healthy job and housing balance.

 

            (i)         The citizens of the City seek a well-planned, aesthetically pleasing and balanced community, with housing affordable to lower-, moderate-, and middle-income households. Workforce housing should be available through the City, and not restricted to a few neighborhoods and areas. However, there may also be trade-offs where constructing affordable units at a different site than the site of the principal projects may produce a greater number of affordable units without additional costs to the project applicant. Thus, the City finds that in certain limited circumstances, the purpose of this chapter may be better served by allowing the developer to comply with the inclusionary requirement through alternative means, such as the payment of in-lieu fees, development of off-site housing, or dedication of land. For example, if a project applicant can produce a significantly greater number of affordable units off site, then it may (but not always) be in the best interest of the City to permit the development of affordable units as a different location than that of the principal project, as further set forth in this Chapter 11.

 

            (j)         The City is aware that there may be times when the inclusionary housing requirements make market-rate housing more expensive. In weighing all the factors, including the significant need for affordable housing, the City has made the decision that the community's interests are best served by the adoption of this inclusionary housing ordinance.

            (ii)        Developments that have been determined to require an environmental impact report and where the housing mitigation for the development would create more low-, moderate-, middle-income units than required by other sections of this chapter.

 

            (3)        The number of inclusionary units required for a particular project will be determined only once, at the time of tentative or parcel map approval, or, for developments not processing a map, prior to issuance of a building permit. If a change in the subdivision design results in a change in the total number of units, the number of inclusionary units required will be recalculated to coincide with the final approved project.

 

            (c)        The following options will satisfy the requirement to provide inclusionary housing:

 

            (1)        Constructing the appropriate number of purchasable inclusionary units.

 

            (2)        Constructing the appropriate number of rental inclusionary units as required by Section 9-11.104 and entering into a contractual agreement with the City, in consideration for a direct financial contribution or other form of assistance, to rent those units at an affordable rate and for a certain duration as described in this chapter.

 

            (3)        Paying an in-lieu fee to be determined in accordance with Section 9-11.104(h) when the number of purchasable inclusionary units required to be built totals less than five (5).

 

            (d)       Any hotel/motel/resort or new commercial development shall provide affordable rental space for at least fifty (50%) percent of the number of peak season employees projected to be employed by the development. Rents for such accommodations may be established by the hotel/motel/resort/commercial operator, provided that when such are rented to other than employees of the operator, the rent may not exceed the prevailing rate charged to the operator's employees for comparable space. All rentals must be for the period of not less than one (1) month.

 

            (e)        Employers in Avalon are encouraged to develop year-round housing for their employees. Any dwelling units in excess of the employees' needs shall be rentable to other members of the community for the period of not less than one (1) month.

 

            (f)        All units in an apartment development shall be made available to members of the community for period of not less than one (1) month. No condo conversions would be allowed.

 

            (g)        Developer of inclusionary units will enter into a recorded regulatory agreement with the City which will include restrictions as set forth by this chapter and administration regulations adopted by resolution.

 

            (h)        Where the required inclusionary units total less than five (5), the developer may request the option of paying an in-lieu fee, to be paid to the City for the Housing Trust Fund. The amount of the fee will be determined at the time the development agreement is finalized and will be reasonably related to the negative impact on affordable housing caused by the development project.

            Sec. 9-11.105        Density Bonus.
 

            The City shall provide the minimum density bonuses and other incentives that are required by California Government Code sections 65915 through 65918. The Citys Planning Director shall propose standards and procedures to implement the statutory requirements. The Directors standards and procedures shall be submitted to the City Council for approval by resolution and may be changed from time to time by the same method. (§9-11.105, Ord. 1092-10, eff.

            Sec. 9-11.106        Density Bonus Unit Rental Administration.
            (a)        Any person building a density bonus unit pursuant to Sections 9-11.105 (Density Bonus) shall be required to execute an agreement and covenant between the applicant and the City.

 

            (b)        The agreement shall provide for the guarantee of tenancy for a period of twelve (12) months in any subsequent rental or lease agreement between the landlord and his agent and any tenant of a dwelling unit created pursuant to Sections 9-11.105.

 

            (c)        The term of the agreement shall be for fifteen (15) years and it will be noncancelable during that period. In case a unit authorized pursuant to Section 9-11.105 is demolished, the property owner will not retain the right to build to density beyond those allowed in the City Land Use Element and the City Zoning Ordinance.

 

            (d)       Upon approval of a density bonus unit, the agreement will be recorded in the public records of Los Angeles County and proof of such recordation shall be provided to the City before any building permit will be issued for any market rate unit or for any affordable unit conditioned, regulated, or authorized under the provisions of this chapter.

 

            (e)        The agreement between the City and the owner of the density bonus unit shall require that a rental or lease agreement shall be signed between the owner or owner's agent and the tenant of any bonus unit. The term of this agreement shall be for one (1) year except as otherwise required.

 

            (f)        All agreements between the landlord or landlord's agent and the tenant for bonus units shall be furnished to the City ten (10) days prior to any tenant occupying the unit.

            Sec. 9-11.107        Prohibition of Short-Term Rentals.
 

            To combat the potential loss of permanent affordable housing in the City, no housing unit in any affordable-housing project may be rented for fewer than thirty (30) days. Affordable-housing project here means any project that is given a density bonus under this chapter. This prohibition on short-term rentals applies to every housing unit in these projects, whether the unit is affordable or market-rate. (Ord. 1174-19, eff. March 21, 2019)

 

            Sec. 9-11.108        Sales Unit Administration.
 

            Through the vehicle of a deed restriction, the City shall require the developer and his successors to guarantee that any dwelling unit made available under this chapter will continually be capable of being purchased by a low-, moderate-, or middle-income household. A dwelling unit is capable of being purchased by a low-, moderate- or middle-income household if the unit can be purchased for an affordable housing cost. For any successive sale of the unit, the right of the City shall be reserved in the deed restriction for the unit to review and verify that the price of the unit does not exceed an affordable housing cost and that the unit is sold to a low-, moderate- or middle-income household.

 

            Units sold pursuant to this section shall only be for twelve (12) month tenancy of residents used as a primary residence as defined in Section 9-11.103 of this chapter.

(§9-11.106, Ord. 1092-10, eff. May 20, 2010)

 

            Sec. 9-11.109        Inclusionary Housing Standards.
 

            Inclusionary units built under this chapter must conform to the following standards:

 

            (a)        Design. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, inclusionary units must be dispersed throughout a residential development and be comparable in infrastructure (including sewer, water and other utilities), construction quality and exterior design to the market-rate units. Inclusionary units shall have at least seventy-five (75%) percent of the square footage of the average size of the market rate units and may have different interior finishes and features than market-rate units so long as the interior features are durable, of good quality and consistent with contemporary standards for new housing.

 

            (b)        Timing. All inclusionary units must be constructed and occupied concurrently with or prior to the construction and occupancy of market-rate units. In phased developments, inclusionary units may be constructed and occupied in proportion to the number of units in each phase of the residential development with approval of the Planning Director.

 

            (c)        Duration of Affordability Requirement. Inclusionary units produced under this chapter must be legally restricted to occupancy by households of the income levels for which the units were designated for a minimum of fifty-five (55) years.

(§9-11.109, Ord. 1092-10, eff. May 20, 2010)

 

            Sec. 9-11.110        Compliance Procedures.
 

            (a)        General. Approval of an Inclusionary Housing Plan and implementation of an approved Inclusionary Housing Agreement is a condition of any tentative map, parcel map or building permit for any development for which this chapter applies. The City Council may impose a fee per inclusionary unit to be set by resolution in order to offset the costs of administering this chapter.

 

            (b)        Inclusionary Housing Plan. Every application for a tentative map, parcel map, or site plan shall include a statement by the applicant that this chapter is not applicable or shall include an Inclusionary Housing Plan. The Planning Director shall review the Inclusionary Housing Plan within sixty (60) days of receipt to determine if the Inclusionary Housing Plan is complete. If the Inclusionary Housing Plan is incomplete, the Inclusionary Housing Plan will be returned to the developer along with a list of the deficiencies or the information required. No application for a tentative map, parcel map, or site plan to which this chapter applies may be deemed complete until an Inclusionary Housing Plan is submitted. At any time during the review process, the Planning Director may require from the developer additional information reasonably necessary to clarify and supplement the application or determine consistency of the proposed Inclusionary Housing Plan with the requirements of this chapter. The Inclusionary Housing Plan must include:

 

            (1)        The location, structure (attached, semi-attached, or detached), proposed tenure (for sale or rental), and size of the proposed market-rate, commercial space and/or inclusionary units and the basis for calculating the number of inclusionary units. Location information should include whether the land is owned by the developer or leased. Leased land would require review of the lease by the City for compliance with the intent of the inclusionary requirements;

 

            (2)        A floor or site plan depicting the location of the inclusionary units;

 

            (3)        The income levels to which each inclusionary unit will be made affordable;

 

            (4)        The mechanisms that will be used to assure that the units remain affordable for the desired term, such as resale and rental restrictions, deeds of trust, and rights of first refusal and other documents;

 

            (5)        For phased development, a phasing plan that provides for the timely development of the number of inclusionary units proportionate to each proposed phase of development as required by Section 9-11.104 of this chapter.

            Sec. 9-11.111        Purchasable Inclusionary Housing.
 

            (a)        Initial Sales Price. The initial sales price of the inclusionary unit must be set so that an eligible household will pay an affordable housing cost.

 

            (b)        Transfer. Where appropriate, revised restrictions will be entered into on each change of ownership prior to the expiration of the 55-year affordability period.

 

            (c)        Resale. The maximum sales price permitted on resale of an inclusionary unit designated for owner-occupancy shall be the lower of: (1) fair market value or (2) the affordable housing cost for an eligible household within the income level applicable to the inclusionary unit.

 

            (d)       Changes in Title. Title of the inclusionary unit may change due to changes in circumstance, including death, marriage and divorce. Upon the death of one (1) of the owners, title in the property may transfer to the surviving joint tenant without respect to the eligibility of the household. Upon the death of a sole owner or all owners and inheritance of the inclusionary unit by a noneligible child or stepchild of one (1) or more owners, there will be a one (1) year compassion period between the time when the estate is settled and the time when the property must be sold to an eligible household. Inheritance of an inclusionary unit by any other person who is not an eligible household shall require resale of the unit to an eligible household as soon as is feasible, but no more than one hundred eighty (180) days. As used herein, resale means legitimate efforts reasonably intended to market the unit.

            Sec. 9-11.112        Qualifications to Purchase Inclusionary Housing.

            (c)        Real Property Ownership. No member of the household can own a residential unit other than the inclusionary unit.

 

            (d)       Income and Asset Limitations. A household's gross income, assets, and household size will be used to determine the housing qualification by calculating:

 

            (1)        The sum of all gross incomes from all occupants over eighteen (18).

 

            (2)        Not more than twenty-five (25%) percent of a household income can come from nonemployment sources.

 

            (3)        Each $20,000.00 in assets above $65,000.00 is converted to $1,500.00 in annual income.

            (c)        The City of Avalon maintains an option to purchase the property for the affordable housing cost, or the appraised value, whichever is lower, as determined in the recorded deed restrictions. Should the City elect to purchase the property, it will provide notice within thirty (30) days of the written notification of the intent to sell the property. At that time, the City will determine whether or not an appraisal is required and will pay for the costs if required.

The owner shall apply the same rental terms and conditions to tenants of inclusionary units as are applied to all other tenants, except as required to comply with this chapter (for example, rent levels, occupancy restrictions and income requirements) or with other applicable government subsidy programs.

 

            (d)       Changes in Tenant Income. If, after moving into an inclusionary unit, a tenant's household income exceeds the limit for that unit, the tenant household may remain in the unit as long as his or her household income does not exceed twenty-five (25%) percent above the income limit. Once the tenant's income exceeds twenty-five (25%) percent above the income limit, the following shall apply:

 

            (1)        If the tenant's income does not exceed the income limits of other inclusionary units in the residential development, the owner may, at the owner's option, allow the tenant to remain in the original unit and redesignate the unit as affordable to households of a higher income level, as long a vacant unit is redesignated for the income category previously applicable to the tenant's household. Otherwise, the tenant shall be given one hundred eighty (180) days notice to vacate the unit. If during the one hundred eighty (180) days, an inclusionary unit becomes available and the tenant meets the income eligibility for that unit, the owner shall allow the tenant to apply for that unit.

 

            (2)        If there are no units designated for a higher income category within the development that may be substituted for the original unit, the tenant shall be given one hundred eighty (180) days notice to vacate the unit. If within that one hundred eighty (180) days another unit in the residential development is vacated, the owner may, at the owner's option, allow the tenant to remain in the original unit and raise the tenant's rent to market-rate and designate the newly vacated unit as an inclusionary unit affordable at the income-level previously applicable to the unit converted to market rate. The newly vacated unit must be comparable in size (for example, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.) as the original unit.

Article 1. Administration; Definitions
 

Sec. 9-12.101   Declaration. 
 

            The City Council hereby finds that the natural resources of Avalon, as discussed in the Avalon General Plan, have finite limits. Such limits are not easily defined, and, as in the case of such resources as water availability, may change from time to time. The City Council further finds that unlimited construction activity within the limited geographical boundaries and topographical features of the City of Avalon would create significant impacts on the environment of Avalon.

 

            In order to mitigate these problems, the City of Avalon hereby implements an annual growth policy.

(Ord. 672)

 

Sec. 9-12.102   Annual Review Board. 
 

            The City shall not approve any development applications which propose the creation of additional units in November and December of any calendar year commencing in 1979.  During this two (2) month period, the City Council, in conjunction with the Planning Commission, shall review the growth permitted in the preceding ten (10) months, review the effects and demands of such development and any additional development upon the City's natural resources, and determine, by resolution, the amount and type of growth the City will permit in the succeeding year, as well as City priori-ties for growth.

(Ord. 672)

 

Sec. 9-12.103   Administration.
 

            (a)        No application for any project which creates any additional living or transient units shall be approved unless the Southern California Edison Company confirms in writing that water is available to serve the project if approved by the City.

 

            (b)        All development applications made pursuant to this title shall be considered by the City in the order that said applications are accepted by the City.

 

            (c)        Applications may include units from two (2) or more development categories as set forth in subsection (d) hereof.

 

            (d)       Any unit approved after this date shall be under construction (defined as foundation work completed and framing in progress) within eighteen (18) months from the date of final Planning Commission or City Council approval. The Planning Commission may approve not more than two (2) six (6) month extensions upon making a determination that an applicant has diligently pursued the construction of the project, and that no substantial change of circum-stances has occurred, and that such extension will not be detrimental to the purpose of these regulations.

 

            The City Council may on appeal grant one additional extension of no more than sixty (60) days upon a finding of extraordinary circumstances.

 

            (e)        The City Council shall establish procedures setting forth tenant eligibility and conditions for low and moderate income rental projects.

(Ord. 672, as amended by §1, Ord. 773, eff. December 17, 1984)

 

Sec. 9-12.104   Definitions.
 

            (a)        "Infilling" shall mean any project which creates four (4) or fewer additional residential units that will be built within the designated infilling area.

 

            (b)        "Residential tract development" shall mean any project of five (5) additional units or greater.

 

            (c)        "Hotel/resort development" shall mean any project which proposes living units that will be used exclusively by transients.  Any unit so proposed may contain kitchen facilities with conditional use permit procedures.

 

            (d)       "Median income" shall mean the median income of all families residing in the Los Angeles Long Beach Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.  In the event that median in-come figures are not available for the time period necessary for a specific development application, the most recent median income figures available will be used and adjusted according to changes in the Consumer Price Index for the same SMSA.

Sec. 9-13.106   Congregate Housing Development Criteria.
 

            Each proposal for new congregate housing development presents important considerations that do not lend themselves to specific development standards. The following criteria shall apply to proposals for new congregate housing and shall serve as the basis for evaluating the proposal relative to both the purposes of this chapter as well as accepted and appropriate planning goals necessary for the orderly development of the City.

 

            (a)        The project should be a comprehensive and integrated design, providing for its own open space, off-street parking and amenities for contemporary living. To the extent the site and the scale of the project allows, open space, walkways and other areas for people should be separated from parking and driveway areas.

 

            (b)        The layout of structures and other facilities should effect a conservation in street, driveway, curb cut, utility and other public or quasi-public improvements. Structures should be designed to minimize, the consumption of natural resources (i.e. gas, water, electricity) either directly or indirectly.

 

            (c)        The project should be designed to maintain as much of the natural topography, large trees and environment as practicable.

 

            (d)       The configuration and orientation of the project should respect reasonable design limits imposed by the natural and manmade environment. Consideration should be given as to whether the structure can be situated to maximize the advantages of view, topography, sun and wind, while at the same time minimizing the impact of the project on the enjoyment of these advantages by adjacent properties, as much as practicable. Structures should also be situated to minimize or buffer undesirable characteristics of the site such as street noise and nearby commercial or industrial uses.

 

            (e)        The layout of the units and open space within the project should establish, through the use of structures and landscape materials, a perceptible spatial transition from the public street, through the semi-privacy of common areas, to the privacy of the units. Most importantly, the environment of each unit should be private and free from visual, auditory and other intrusions.

 

            (f)        The project shall comply with State standards facilitating access for the disabled.

(§8, Ord. 775, eff. January 21, 1985; §8, Ord. 935-96, eff. October 17, 1996)

 

Sec. 9-13.107   Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions or Other Management Documents. 
 

            To achieve the purpose of this chapter, the declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or other management documents relating to the management of the common area and facilities shall accompany all proposals for congregate housing usage and shall be subject to the approval of the City Attorney's office.  In addition to such covenants, conditions and restrictions that may be required by the Department of Real Estate of the State of California or pursuant to Title 6 of Part IV of Division II of the Civil Code or other State laws or policies, such declaration, proprietary lease, cooperative housing corporation by-laws or other similar document shall provide for the following, none of which, after acceptance in final form by the City, shall be amended modified or changed without first obtaining the written consent of the City:

 

            (a)        Assignment or Conveyance of Private Open Space. The surface area and appurtenant airspace of private open space areas and any integral portion of those spaces shall be described and irrevocably assigned to its respective unit, except that where the private open space is totally within the boundary described by the interior surfaces of the unit, it shall be conveyed, leased or assigned as an integral part of the unit.

 

            (b)        Assignment or Conveyance of Private Storage Areas. The surfaces and appurtenant airspace of private storage areas shall be described and irrevocably assigned in the declaration, condominium plan or proprietary lease to its respective unit, except that where the private storage space is totally within the boundary described by the interior surfaces of the unit, as it would be in a closet opening upon a unit's room or hallway, it shall be conveyed, leased or assigned as an integral part of the unit.

 

            (c)        Maintenance of Impact Insulation Class. The impact/insulation rating requirements required by the Department of Real Estate shall be described in the declaration and/or proprietary lease and such documents shall provide that the floor covering shall not be removed for any purpose except cleaning or replacement, and shall further provide that any replacement covering(s) shall furnish not less than the degree of impact insulation afforded by the coverage originally installed.

 

            (d)       Right of Public Entry to Common Area.  The City of Avalon, the County of Los Angeles, the State of California, and the Government of the United States, and any department, bureau or agency thereof, shall have the right of immediate access to all portions of common areas of the project not assigned for the exclusive use of the owner of a particular unit at all times for the purpose of preserving the public health, safety and welfare except in those instances where a common area is accessible only through a private unit.  Notice of such right of government agency access shall be prominently displayed in the common area of the project.

 

            (e)        Television and Radio Antenna.  Individual television and radio antennas shall be prohibited outside of any owner's unit.  The declaration, cooperative housing corporation bylaws or proprietary lease shall provide either for a central antenna with connections to each unit via underground or internal wall wiring or each unit shall be served by either a cable antenna service provided by a company licensed to provide such service within the City or by an effective antenna located wholly within the confines of the unit.

 

            (f)        Voting.  For the purpose of voting, including without limitation voting to set the amount of regular or special assessment and for the purpose of amending the management documents, one vote shall be allocated for each unit within the project.  The amount of regular and special assessments may be made proportional to the gross square footage of each unit within the project.

 

            (g)        Partition and Sale of the Project.  An action may be brought by one or more owners within the project for partition thereof (or for dissolution of the cooperative housing corporation) by sale of the entire project as if the owners of all of the units in such project were tenants in common in the entire project in the same proportion as their interests in the common areas or in the stock or members of the cooperative housing corporation; provided, however, that a partition shall be made only upon a showing of the existence or one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 1354 of the California Civil Code, or that:

 

            (1)        Two (2) years after damage or destruction to the project which renders a material part thereof unfit for its use, the project has not been rebuilt or repaired substantially to its state prior to its damage or destruction; or

 

            (2)        One-half (1/2) or more of the project has been destroyed or substantially damaged and owners holding in aggregate more than fifty (50%) percent interest in the common area or the cooperative housing corporation are opposed to repair or restoration of the project; or

 

            (3)        The structure has been in existence in excess of the number of years shown on the following table, is obsolete and uneconomic, and the percentage of owners holding in aggregate a percentage interest in the common areas or cooperative housing corporation as set forth in the following table are opposed to repair or restoration of the project.

                                 40 years                                                      60 percent

                                 50 years                                                      50 percent

                                 60 years                                                      40 percent

                                 70 years                                                      30 percent

 

            For purposes of this section, multiple owners of a single unit shall not be deemed possessed, in the aggregate, of any greater interest in the common area or in the cooperative housing corporation than that possessed by a single owner of a unit.

 

            (h)        Maintenance.  The declaration and/or other management documents shall contain a provision establishing the obligation and duty of the governing body of the project to maintain the common areas in good condition.

 

            (i)         Enforcement.  The declaration and other management documents shall contain a provision insuring the right of any owner to enforce the terms thereof.

 

            (j)         Assessments for Maintenance of Common Areas and Facilities.

 

            (1)        General.  In order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, provision shall be made both for annual assessments for maintenance and special assessments for capital improvements.  The amount of the regular annual assessment, and the procedure for its change shall be specified.  The manner in which special assessments may be levied for the purpose of defraying, in whole or in part, the cost of any construction, reconstruction, repair or replacement of a capital improvement upon the common area shall be specified.  The amount of regular and special assessments may be made, in whole or in part, proportional to the gross square footage of each unit within the project. Both annual and special assessments may be collected on a monthly basis.  The remedies which the association may bring for the nonpayment of assessments shall be specified and may include penalties for late payment.

 

            (2)        Veto Right and Authority of the City.  In consideration for the City's approval of a project, including without limitation any approval of a conversion to congregate housing usage, the declaration and/or other management documents shall provide that the City at its option has the right and authority to veto any action of the association which would tend to decrease the amount of the regular annual assessment upon a finding by the City that such a decrease could or would adversely affect the long-run maintenance of the project structure and/or its common areas. To enable the City to exercise said optional veto, the declaration or other management documents shall provide that association actions to decrease the annual assessment do not become effective until sixty (60) days after written notice of such action is given to the City.

 

            (k)        Utility Easements over Private Streets and Other Areas.  If the project contains private streets, provision shall be made for public utility easements over the entire private street network.  The Planning Commission may also require public utility easements adjacent to public streets or over other portions of the project to accommodate fire hydrants, water meters, street furniture, storm drainage, sanitary sewers, water and gas mains, electrical lines and similar urban infrastructure. The Planning Commission may also require access routes necessary to assure that fire fighting equipment can reach and operate efficiently in all areas of the project.

 

            (l)         Amendment of the Declaration or Other Management Document.  Any amendment to the declaration or other management documents which would amend, modify, delete or otherwise affect any provision required by this section shall require the prior written approval of the City. To that end, no such amendment shall be effective unless: (i) the text there-of shall have been submitted to the City sixty (60) days prior to its adoption by the owners; (ii) either the City has approved the amendment or failed to disapprove it within said sixty (60) day period; and (iii) the recorded or other instrument effecting such amendment shall recite that it was so submitted and approved or not disapproved.

 

            (m)       Provision shall be made for conveyance of units and assignment of parking.

Sec. 9-13.108   Congregate Housing Conversions.
 

            (a)        Conversion Criteria.  The Planning Commission shall approve or conditionally approve a conditional use permit for the conversion of a multiple family residential structure to congregate housing usage only upon a finding that the conversion will not adversely affect the supply of rental housing, especially low and moderate income housing, in the City.  In reaching this finding the Commission may consider all relevant factors, including: (i) the City-wide vacancy rate and the vacancy rate for low and moderate income units; (ii) the number of units being removed from the rental market by the proposed conversion; (iii) the number, quality, and location of alternative housing opportunities available to existing tenants; (iv) the cumulative effect of the proposed conversion along with the effect of past conversions upon the availability of low and moderate income units; and (v) the effect of the proposed conversion, if any, upon the City's tourist industry.

 

            (b)        Prohibited Conversions.  No hotel, motel, hotel/resort development, or other structure designed exclusively for transient occupancy may be converted to congregate housing usage.

 

            (c)        Affordable Housing Requirements for Congregate Housing Conversions. All proposed congregate housing conversion projects must satisfy the affordable housing requirements described in Chapter 11.  For the purposes of that chapter, a proposed conversion project shall be treated as a new residential development.  Existing low and moderate income tenants shall have priority over other eligible tenants in occupying these specially designated units.

 

            (d)       Notice to Tenants of Proposed Congregate Housing Conversion.  Before filing an application for a conditional use permit for the conversion of a multiple family residential structure to congregate housing usage, the applicant must first deliver to each tenant within the structure and to each prospective tenant thereafter a notice regarding the proposed conversion. Such notice must be delivered to all such tenants at least fifteen (15) days prior to any public hearing regarding the conditional use permit for the proposed conversion. Such notice shall contain the following information: (i) the name and address of the project's owner or owner's representative; (ii) a full description of the tenant's right to purchase a converted unit; (iii) the approximate date of the proposed conversion; (iv) a full description of any relocation assistance benefits or continued occupancy rights available to the tenant; and (v) the tenant's right to be heard at any public hearings regarding the conditional use permit for the conversion, and the date(s) of such hearing(s). (Proof of service of the notice as well as a list of names and addresses of all tenants shall be provided to City.)

 

            The applicant bears the burden of demonstrating at any public hearing regarding the conditional use permit for the proposed conversion that applicant has fully satisfied the requirements of this subsection.

 

            (e)        Notice to Tenants of Termination of Tenancy.  All tenants shall receive a one hundred eighty (180) days' written notice of intention to convert prior to the issuance of the notice to vacate. Such notice of intention to convert may not be issued until the applicant has received a conditional use permit for the proposed conversion project.  At the end of such one hundred eighty (180) day period, the applicant may issue a written notice to vacate to all tenants. Tenants shall vacate within thirty (30) days of receipt of such written notice to vacate.

 

            (f)        Tenant's Right to Purchase Congregate Housing Converted Unit. All tenants occupying a unit which has been approved for conversion shall have a nontransferable right of first refusal to purchase the occupied unit at the same or at better terms than those offered to the general public. Such right of first refusal shall be effective for a period of not less than ninety (90) days from the date at which such units are offered for sale to the general public, as described in Section 66427.1 of the Government Code of the State of California. The tenant may waive any such right by executing a written notice to that effect or by terminating his or her lease and vacating the unit without acting upon the right.

 

            (g)        Tenant's Right to Continued Occupancy in a Congregated Housing Converted Unit.  All "special case" tenants, here defined as any elderly or handicapped persons of limited means or households of low or moderate income as defined in Chapter 11, shall be entitled to continued occupancy in a unit approved for conversion for a period of one year from the date of receiving a written notice to vacate from the applicant. All such special case tenants must receive a second written notice to vacate thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of such continued occupancy period.  No increase in rents shall be permitted during the course of such a period of continued occupancy.

 

            (h)        Relocation Benefits Available to Tenants of Approved Congregate Housing Conversion Projects.  All applicants must develop a relocation assistance plan, containing, at a minimum, the following elements.  Such plan shall be subject to review and modification by the Planning Commission:

 

            (1)        The applicant shall pay to each existing tenant household on or before the date the unit is to be vacated for the approved conversion the sum of Five Hundred and no/100ths ($500.00) Dollars to cover the cost of moving expenses. The applicant shall also pay to each tenant household on or before the date the unit is to be vacated, certain relocation benefits to compensate for any anticipated increased future rent consisting of the greater of:

 

            (i)         The sum of One Thousand and no/100ths ($1,000.00) Dollars, or

 

            (ii)        A sum equal to the current monthly rental for the unit multiplied by the number of years or portion thereof of tenancy, except that under no circumstances shall the latter figure exceed the amount of Five Thousand and no/100ths ($5,000.00) Dollars. Each tenant choosing this alternative must, at least fifteen (15) days prior to vacation of the unit, provide adequate supporting documentation to the owner showing the date tenancy commenced.  Should a tenant remain in the unit more than thirty (30) days after receipt of a written notice to vacate, such relocation benefit shall be reduced by an amount equal to one month's rental for each subsequent month of tenancy.

 

            (2)        The applicant shall also assist tenants in finding a comparable replacement rental unit.  Comparability shall be determined from the following factors: size, price, location, and amenities.  For purposes of this chapter, a unit shall not be deemed "comparable" if such unit is located in a building for which an application for conversion purposes has been filed with any governmental agency.  Such assistance shall include at a minimum the following:

 

            (i)         Making available to such tenants a bi-monthly report concerning the availability of comparable rental housing in the vicinity of the condominium project; and

 

            (ii)        Driving tenants without automobiles in order to inspect such comparable housing.

 

            This subsection shall only apply to the conversion to congregate use of a multiple family residential structure consisting of five (5) or more units.

Sec. 10-2.212   Mooring Places: Use of by Guests, Long Term Use Permit Requirements, Fees.
 

            (a)            Use of Moorings by Guests, Fees. Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful for any person to use a mooring other than his or her own except by permission of the Harbor Master and except after payment to the Harbor Master of a service charge in an amount specified by resolution of the City Council pursuant to the provisions of Section 10-2.218. The mooring assigned to a guest vessel is not guaranteed and such guest vessel may have to relocate on a daily basis as directed by the Harbor Master.

 

            (b)         Payment of Fees. All service charges shall be paid prior to departure from the assigned mooring. Failure to pay all or any portion of a service charge which is due and owing prior to departure from the assigned mooring shall result in a penalty in the amount equal to the service charges owing, in addition to payment of any service charge owing. The Harbor Master shall have the authority to waive the penalty where the person in charge of the vessel first advises the Harbor Master of the need to remove the vessel from the mooring for repair or of the vessel owner's desire to move the vessel outside City waters in order to avoid additional mooring fees, provided the owner has entered into an agreement for payment of outstanding fees. No person shall be permitted to pay outstanding fees under a payment plan more than once in any twelve (12) month period. There shall be added to any mooring fees that are more than fourteen (14) days past due, interest at the rate of one-half of one (1/2%) percent per month. Except when small craft or gale warnings are in effect, the Harbor Master shall have the authority to deny use of a mooring in City waters, if there are any outstanding fees as provided under this Title owed to the City by the owner or person in charge of such vessel.

 

            (c)         Reduced Fees During Specified Time Period. During the period from October 15 through Palm Sunday, after payment of the service charge set forth in this subsection for the first two (2) consecutive nights a mooring is used, such user shall be entitled to the use of such a mooring for an additional consecutive period up to and including five (5) days without charge, provided moorings are available, and provided, further, no portion of the five (5) day period falls on Palm Sunday. If a boat remains unattended during this period for more than seven (7) consecutive days, a service charge shall be paid on the regular nightly basis.

 

            (d)            City-Owned Moorings. Commercial boats which are essential to the operation of the harbor and boats owned by residents of Avalon who have lived continuously on a boat in the harbor for six (6) months, and who maintain the boat in the harbor as their only residence, may be given priority on the application list for obtaining a City-owned mooring, provided residents who vacate the mooring or fail to reside in the boat for more than eighteen (18) days in any calendar month shall forfeit the mooring. Moorings made available on a priority basis shall be allocated to vessels of conforming size on a first-come, first-serve basis. No more than twenty (20%) percent of City-owned moorings may be allocated under this priority process. Nontransferable revocable permits for the use of City-owned moorings may be issued by the Harbor Master under a Council-approved list application procedure on a yearly rental basis in an amount set by resolution of the City Council pursuant to Section 10-2.218.

 

            (e)            Vessels Less than Fourteen Feet. The rules governing the mooring of vessels less than fourteen (14') feet shall be as provided in Section 10-2.206.

 

            (f)            Long Term Vessel Permit Required. Except as provided herein, the owner or operator of a long term vessel as defined in this article shall be required to obtain a permit from the Harbor Master by the fifteenth consecutive day of being moored in City waters during the applicable period as a condition of continued use of City moorings. A permit shall not be required of vessel owners and/or operators holding a revocable mooring permit or operating the vessel pursuant to a Waterside Permit. Long Term Vessel Permits will be issued beginning on November 1 for a 30-day period and will be automatically renewed the first day of each month up to and including March 30 of each year unless the Harbor Master gives notice to the permit holder that he/she has become ineligible to be granted an extension for failure to comply with the conditions thereof.

 

            The permit shall be issued only if all of the following conditions exist:

 

       (1)      All fees and service charges provided for in this Title are current or payments under a payment plan are current;

 

       (2)     The Harbor Master has inspected the vessels and the owner and/or operator has demonstrated that it complies with Section 10-2.512.

 

       (3)        If the permittee, within the previous three (3) years, has entered into a payment plan for the payment of outstanding mooring fees or other Harbor Department charges, the permittee shall also be required to pay, in addition to the applicable mooring fee(s), a security deposit in a sum equal to the following one (1) month's mooring fees, refundable upon expiration of the permit, less any fees owed to the City at the time of expiration of the permit.

 

       (4)     The vessel is equipped with a functioning marine sanitation device which complies with U.S. Coast Guard regulations where all through-hull valves are properly closed to prevent illegal discharge and/or dumping while in City waters.

 

       (5)  Proof of insurance as described in Section 10-2.219.

 

     The permittee shall comply with all applicable County, State, and Federal laws, the provisions of the Avalon Municipal Code and any resolutions adopted by the City Council, and all terms and conditions of the permit. Failure to comply with these laws, ordinances, resolutions, or policies shall constitute grounds for revocation of the permit and may result in the loss of use of City moorings. If the Harbor Master finds a permittee has violated any term or condition of the permit, harbor regulations or other applicable harbor related laws, the Harbor Master may suspend or revoke the permit. A decision by the Harbor Master to suspend or revoke a Long Term Mooring permit pursuant to this section shall be appealable to the City Council. Any such appeal must be filed in writing with the City Clerk within ten (10) days of the date of suspension or revocation. The suspension or revocation shall be stayed while the appeal is pending. The appeal shall be filed in writing and shall specify all of the grounds for the appeal. If the appeal is denied, suspension or revocation shall become effective three (3) days following the City Council's decision.

Sec. 10-2.410   Permits; Franchises to Conduct Businesses.
 

            (a)            The City facilities serve as a primary point of ingress and egress for large numbers of people and their relatively small size make necessary control and coordination of businesses operating on the City facilities to avoid undue congestion, to assure against hazard, excessive noise and traffic and to prevent confusion and injury.

 

            (b)            It is necessary and vital to the safe and efficient movement of people through the City facilities that the number, nature and scope of businesses on the City facilities be regulated to protect the safety and welfare of all persons. The Council shall, accordingly, have the power and authority, in its discretion, to authorize the use or occupation of the City facilities or some portion thereof to any person by issuance of a waterside project permit. It shall be unlawful for any person, entity or business to use or occupy City facilities for any business purpose, including all land transportation services, without first being issued a waterside project permit by the City Council and entering into a permit agreement.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Council may, in its discretion, award exclusive franchises for shore boat service and baggage handling service on the Mole, for a term not to exceed five (5) years. Such franchises are vital and necessary to the public safety and welfare in that a proliferation of such services within the limited area available would make for excessive traffic congestion and confusion.

 

            (c)           Neither franchisee need obtain a separate waterside project permit under this section but shall be holders of a City business license. The franchisee shall enter into a franchise agreement with the City which sets forth the terms and conditions of operation of such services.

 

            (d)            For the reasons set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, it is necessary to establish limitations and restrictions on businesses providing nonvital recreational services in the harbor. The following regulations are designed to reduce congestion and to encourage safe, reliable, and year-round provision of recreational services:

 

       (1)      No more than one hundred fourteen (114) watercraft rentals-without-operator vessels shall be granted harbor permits.

 

       (2)      All businesses operating in the harbor, except those enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section and fishing tournament operators, shall maintain a shore base of operations or an office on Santa Catalina Island. Such office shall have a business telephone which is covered twenty-four (24) hours per day. Any answering service or mechanical means of recording messages may be used provided messages are checked by the operator no less than three (3) times per day.

 

       (3)      All businesses operating in the harbor, except those enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section shall provide an insurance policy in compliance with Section 1-6.01 of this Code, shall hold a City business license and shall hold all necessary permits, licenses, certificates or other similar approvals necessary under the law for the type of service performed.

 

       (4)        In addition to the provisions of Section 10-2.402, all businesses operating within the harbor, except those operating pursuant to a franchise issued by the City, shall:

 

(i) In the case of new cross-channel carriers, obtain and keep in force a bond or bank letter of credit to secure payment of wharfage fees in the amount of One Hundred Thousand and no/100ths ($100,000.00) Dollars. After five (5) years of continuous operation, and once annually thereafter, the cross-channel carrier may request the City Council to eliminate or reduce the security. Upon consideration of such request, the City Council should give consideration to the carrier's history of timeliness of payments, any planned or foreseeable significant changes in operation which may impact expenses and revenues, the tariff schedule, a current statement of assets and liabilities, and business plan or other projection of revenues and expenses.

 

(ii) In the case of waterside permit holders other than cross-channel carriers and other than fishing tournament operators subject to this article which have held fishing tournaments in Avalon prior to the effective date of this ordinance*, pay to the City a nonrefundable use fee deposit of One Thousand and no/100ths ($1,000.00) Dollars, payable in two (2) installments of Five Hundred and no/100ths ($500.00) Dollars each, the first installment on the inception of operations within the Avalon Harbor and the second on August 1. The use fee deposit may be applied against use fees due and owing under Section 10-2.402 at such time that the permittee has made timely payment of use fees for thirteen (13) consecutive months.

 

(iii) In all cases where the business operates seven (7) or more months during any twelve (12) month period, pay to the City use fees under Section 10-2.402 no fewer than seven (7) months of any twelve (12) month period, and in no event less than the sum of Twenty-Five and no/100ths ($25.00) Dollars per month for each month the business is operating and reports sales receipts.

 

(iv) In all cases except fishing tournament operators, where the business operates fewer than seven (7) months during any twelve (12) month period, pay to the City a use fee of Two Hundred and no/100ths ($200.00) Dollars for each month the business is closed or does not report any sales receipts.

 

       (5)     The charges authorized by paragraph (4) of this section shall be in addition to any payments pursuant to the provisions of any lease agreement.

 

       (6)      All vessels over sixteen (16') feet in length operated for hire or used to conduct work in the harbor shall be equipped with a marine radio which shall be monitored at all times that the vessel is in operation.

 

       (7)      All businesses operating in the harbor shall maintain all equipment, materials, facilities, machinery and vessels utilized in the operation of the licensed business in a good and working condition, and such businesses shall only employ workers who are qualified to conduct the duties appropriate to the licensed business.

 

            (e)            For the purposes of this section, "harbor" shall mean that area from inside Cabrillo Mole to inside Casino Groin.

            (d)            The proposed business will not have a deleterious impact on the public health, safety and welfare.

 

            The term of any such franchise shall not exceed five (5) years. The franchise shall enter into a franchise agreement with the City which sets forth the terms and conditions of operation of such service, including a franchise fee to be paid to the City.

            (h)            In order to enforce the provisions of this section and to safeguard and protect City waters from contamination, the owner and/or person in charge of any boat or vessel entering City waters shall, as condition of entering and/or remaining in City waters, allow City personnel to board the vessel and place dye tablets into the vessel's marine sanitary device, and to perform a test or tests to ensure that the marine sanitary device is in such a condition as to prevent any contaminants from being discharged into City waters. It shall be unlawful for any person to deny City personnel access to a vessel for purposes of placing dye tablets in the marine sanitary device, to refuse or interfere with testing of the marine sanitary device by City personnel, to tamper with or remove while in City waters any dye tablet placed in a marine sanitary device by City personnel, or to place any substance in the marine sanitary device with the intent to interfere with the enforcement of this section.

            (i)            In the event that the Harbor Department observes or receives information that any vessel is discharging into City waters any liquid or solid material from or through its marine sanitation device, marine holding tank or related or connected equipment in violation of this section, as evidenced by the discharge of dye placed into the facility pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, or has tampered with or removed dye tablets placed in the sanitation device, or if the owner or person apparently in charge does not permit or interferes with the placing of dye tablets or performance of any testing of the marine sanitation device by the Harbor Department required by this section, then the Harbor Master or any harbor patrol officer shall locate, if present on the vessel, the owner or person in apparent control or possession of the vessel and present the evidence of discharge, tampering or removal, refusal or interference and offer that person the opportunity to respond to or rebut the evidence. The conference shall be informal. If, after the informal conference, the Harbor Master or harbor patrol officer concludes that the discharge emanated from the subject vessel, or that tampering or removal of the dye tablets has occurred, or that the placing of dye tablets or testing of the marine sanitation device has been refused or interfered with, the Harbor Master or harbor patrol officer shall issue an order barring the vessel and the person owning and/or in possession of the vessel from entering City waters on the subject vessel, and any other vessel under the person's ownership or control. In the case of discharge, the order shall be for a period of one (1) year, effective immediately. In the case of tampering or removal of dye tablets or refusal or interference with the placing of dye tablets or performance of testing, the order shall be for a period of two (2) years, effective immediately. The order shall be made in writing and delivered personally to the subject vessel owner and/or person in apparent control unless actions of the owner or person in control make such delivery impractical or infeasible. Where personal delivery cannot be made, a copy of the order shall be sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the person to whom the vessel is registered. The order may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of Section 10-2.217.

Violation of Section 10-2.503 shall be a strict liability offense.

 

            (k) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (j) of this section, no violation of this section shall occur where a vessel mechanic licensed to do business in Avalon Harbor complies with the following requirements: (1) notifies the Avalon Harbor Department of the vessel name, its location and the type of repair requested prior to commencing repairs; (2) notifies the Avalon Harbor Department that the holding tank of the vessel on which he intends to conduct repairs has been pumped out, or provides an explanation of why the tank cannot be pumped out prior to commencing repair work; (3) notifies the Avalon Harbor Department prior to conducting a test flush, at which time a Harbor Deputy shall be sent to the vessel to observe the flush, or if a Harbor Deputy is not available within a reasonable time, the Harbor Department may authorize the mechanic to proceed with the test flush as agent for the Avalon Harbor Department; and (4) notifies the Avalon Harbor Department when all repairs have been completed and the mechanic or vessel owner or other person in charge is present at the vessel while new dye tablets are placed in the head(s) and a test flush is conducted. A discharge which occurs during such repair or tests conducted to confirm the successful completion of the repair shall not result in liability or penalty to the mechanic or vessel owner or other person in charge, provided there is compliance with the foregoing requirements.
