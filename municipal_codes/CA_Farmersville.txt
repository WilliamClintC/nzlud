FARMERSVILLE, CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Farmersville, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 8, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Farmersville, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1985, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Mr. Patrick King, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.14.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.14 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 8, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 487 , passed September 24, 2018.

\HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. Some titles are "Reserved" for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.08, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Treasurer, and Chapter 2.12, City Council. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code. This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 8, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 5.14, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 8, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System." (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "Reserved" for later use.

    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage the submission of ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. We prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

3.40.150 - Administrative remedy. 
A.  Whenever the tax administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owned by him or her from the amounts remitted to a service supplier required to collect the tax, or that a service user has failed to pay the amount of the tax for a period of two or more billing periods, or whenever the tax administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, the tax administrator may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from certain named service users for specific billing periods.

Title 4 - IMPACT FEES 
Chapters: 
Chapter 4.01 - DEVELOPMENT FEES 
Sections: 

4.01.010 - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the development impact fee ordinance of the city of Farmersville, California. 
(Ord. 425 (part), 2006) 
4.01.020 - Findings. 
    The city council of the city of Farmersville hereby finds and declares as follows: 
A.  The state of California, through the enactment of Government Code Sections 66001 through 66009 has, among other things, determined the nexus that must be established in the enactment of development impact fees. 
B.  The imposition of development impact fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that development bears a proportionate share of the cost of public facilities and service improvements necessary to accommodate such development. This must be done in order to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
C.  This chapter recognizes that all new development within the city will result in additional growth and that such growth will place additional burdens on various city facilities, infrastructure and services. This chapter further recognizes the types of land development that will generate impacts necessitating the acquisition of land and construction of public facilities and expansion of services and infrastructure in order to meet and accommodate them. 
D.  All land uses within the city should bear a proportionate financial burden in the construction and improvement of public facilities and services necessary to serve them. 
E.  The cost of providing public facilities and service improvements occasioned by development projects within the city of Farmersville exceeds the revenue generated by fees exacted from the development projects. 
F.  The development impact fees established by this chapter are based upon the costs which are generated through the need for new facilities and other capital acquisition costs required, incremental, by new development within the city of Farmersville. 
G.  The fees established by this chapter do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by development projects within the city of Farmersville. 
H.  The fees established by this chapter relate rationally to the reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by development projects within the city of Farmersville, which public facilities are consistent with the general plan and the various elements of the general plan of the city of Farmersville. 
I.  The public facilities and anticipated future development herein referenced are based upon an analysis of existing land use and zoning. 
J.  The fees established by this chapter are consistent with the goals and objectives of the city's general plan and are designed to mitigate the impacts caused by new development throughout the city. Development impact fees are necessary in order to finance the required public facilities and service improvements and to pay for new development's fair share of their construction costs. 
K.  Imposition of fees to finance public facilities and service improvements is necessary in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare.

4.01.090 - Computation of fees. 
    The approved zoning for the development project shall be used in the computation of the fees required to be paid with respect to any property. If a parcel contains more than one zone, then the applicable fees shall be prorated by acreage or units, as appropriate, attributable to each zone. Public properties shall be classified into the category of use as between residential, commercial or industrial, and shall pay fees pursuant to that classification, as determined by the director of planning of the city (herein "planning director") or his duly authorized designee. All fees due hereunder shall be determined and calculated by the city engineer (herein "city engineer") or his duly authorized designee. The city engineer or his designee shall have the further authority to determine the specific amount of development impact fees to be assessed against a use which is not specifically or typically associated with the various land use zone districts for which the development impact fees are established. In the determination and calculation, the city engineer shall establish a written record of the calculation and nexus to infrastructure impacts for the projects identified above. 
(Ord. 425 (part), 2006)

A.  Fees imposed on residential development shall be collected in accordance with the provisions of California Government Code Section 66007, as the same presently exists or may hereafter be amended from time to time. An applicant for a residential building permit may request that payment be deferred until the date of final inspection. Said request shall be approved when the property owner posts proper security in the form of cash deposit, letter of credit or other similar instrument retrievable at the time request is made for final inspection. The form and manner of the security shall be approved by the city manager. 
B.  Fees imposed on industrial and commercial development may be deferred by action of the city council. Such action shall consist of the adoption of a resolution consistent with the following terms and conditions: 
1.  A determination is made that such action will promote and stimulate economic development within the city. The city council shall make specific findings setting forth how the subject project accomplishes this goal. 
2.  Establish a specific timetable for payment in full of the deferred fees. The council may also require a percentage to be paid with the issuance of a building permit. In no event shall deferral of payment in full be permitted for more than five years. 
3.  Interest on the unpaid portion of deferred impact fees shall accrue at a rate equal to the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) interest rate in effect at the time the resolution is adopted and shall be articulated in said resolution. Interest shall be due and payable, in full, with the final payment, although interest may be paid earlier at the election of the party developing the project. 
4.  A written guarantee of payment in full of said impact fees, in the form of a surety bond or some other form of surety instrument as may be acceptable to the city engineer and the city attorney, shall be executed and delivered to the city prior to the issuance of a building permit for the project. Interest in real property may be deemed an appropriate form of surety. 
5.  A determination is made that such deferral of the fees shall not materially affect the financial ability of the city to satisfy its then current five-year capital improvement program. 
C.  Development impact fees shall be paid prior to map recordation or deed recordation parcels intended for water well sites, storm drainage basins, park, police, fire or other government facilities. 
D.  The term "building permit" as used herein includes any permits required for construction, reconstruction, remodeling, moving structures into the city, and the like, such as electrical and plumbing permits, moving permits, and the like. 
E.  The fees created pursuant to this chapter shall be calculated on the basis of gross acreage, or number of units, as set forth in the resolution referenced in Section 4.01.050 of this chapter. For development projects containing a fraction of a net acre, the fee shall be calculated on the fraction of the acre involved in the development project. All fees collected shall be promptly deposited in the appropriate fund referenced in Section 4.01.080 of this chapter. All fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be the fees in effect at the time of collection; provided that fees collected pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be those in effect at the time the council adopts the required resolution. 
(Ord. 425 (part), 2006) 
4.01.110 - Fee adjustments. 
A.  A developer of any project subject to the fees described herein may apply to the city council for a reduction, adjustment, or waiver of any one or more of the fees, based upon the absence of any reasonable relationship or nexus between the impacts of that development and either the amount of the fee(s) charged or the type of facilities to be financed. The application shall be made in writing and filed with the city clerk not later than: (1) ten days prior to the public hearing on the development permit application for the project; or (2) if no development permit is required, at the time of the filing of the request for a building permit. 
B.  The application shall state in detail the factual basis for the claim of waiver, reduction or adjustment. 
C.  The city council shall consider the application at the public hearing on the permit application or at a separate public hearing held within sixty days after the filing of the fee adjustment application, whichever is later. The hearing shall be noticed and conducted in the same fashion and manner as prescribed by the laws of the city for hearing on development permits. The decision of the city council shall be final. 
D.  If a reduction, adjustment or waiver is granted, any change in use within the project shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment or reduction of the fee if such change in use would render the same inappropriate. 
E.  The city council may, from time to time, and as the need may arise, set forth, by council resolution, specific limitations which will apply to reductions, adjustments or waivers of development impact fees which may be made pursuant to this section. In this regard, this chapter shall be considered enabling and directory. 
(Ord. 425 (part), 2006) 
4.01.120 - Use of funds. 
A.  Funds collected from development impact fees shall be used for the purpose of: (1) paying the actual or estimated costs of constructing and/or improving the public facilities within the city to which the specific fee or fees relate, including any required acquisition of land or rights-of-way therefore; (2) reimbursing the city for the development's share of those public facilities already constructed by the city or to reimburse the city for costs advanced, including, without limitation, administrative costs incurred with respect to a specific public facilities project; or (3) to reimburse other developers who have constructed public facilities described in the resolution adopted pursuant to Section 4.01.050 of this chapter, where those facilities were beyond that needed to mitigate the impact of the developer's project or projects. 
B.  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for advanced provision of public facilities for which development impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities provided are of the type to which the fees involved relate. 
C.  At least once each fiscal period, the city manager of the city of Farmersville (herein "city manager"), or his duly authorized designee, shall present to the city council a proposed five-year capital improvement program for the various public facilities referenced in the resolution adopted pursuant to Section 4.01.050 of this chapter assigning monies (including any accrued interest) from the funds referenced in Section 4.01.080 of this chapter to specific improvement projects and related expenses. Monies, including any accrued interest, not assigned in any fiscal period shall be retained in the same fund until the next fiscal period except as provided by the refund provisions of Section 4.01.130 of this chapter. 
D.  Funds may be used to provide refunds as described in Section 4.01.080 of this chapter.

(Ord. 425 (part), 2006) 
4.01.130 - Refund of fees paid. 
A.  If a building permit expires without commencement of construction, then the fee payer shall be entitled to a refund, without interest, of the impact fee paid as a condition for its issuance, except that the city shall retain one percent of the fee to offset a portion of the costs of collection and refund. The fee payer must submit an application for such a refund to the city manager within thirty calendar days of the expiration of the permit. Failure to timely submit the required application for refund shall constitute a waiver of any right to the refund. 
B.  In the event any fee collected pursuant to this chapter remains unexpended or uncommitted in any fund established pursuant to Section 4.01.080 of this chapter five or more years after deposit of the fee, the city shall make findings once each fiscal year to identify the purpose to which the fee is to be put and to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was charged. 
C.  The unexpended or uncommitted portion of the fee, and any interest accrued thereon, for which need cannot be demonstrated pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be refunded to the then-current record owner or owners of lots or units of the development project or projects on a prorated basis. 
D.  The provisions of California Government Code Sections 66001(d), (e) and (f) shall apply fully to any refund of fees remaining unexpended or uncommitted in any such city fund for five or more years after deposit, and the provisions of subsections B and C of this section shall be subordinate to the section and shall be applied consistent therewith.

Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such debt. The provisions of this section shall not be deemed a limitation upon the right of the city to bring any other action including criminal, civil and equitable actions, based upon the failure to pay the tax, penalties and/or fees imposed by this chapter or the failure to comply with any provisions of this chapter. 
B.  In addition to any other remedies available under federal, state, or local law, if any amount required to be paid to the county under this chapter is not paid when due, the collector may, within three years after the amount is due, record a certificate of lien specifying the amount of taxes, fees and penalties due, and the name and address of the person as it appears on the records of the collector. The lien shall also specify that the collector has complied with all provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount required to be paid. From the time of the filing of the record, the amount required to be paid, together with penalties thereon, constitutes a lien upon all real property in the county owned by the person, or subsequently acquired by the person before the lien expires. The lien has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten years from the filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. A fee may be adopted by the city council and collected by the collector to pay for the cost of recording and administering the lien. 
C.  At any time within three years after any person is delinquent in the payment of any amount herein required to be paid or within three years after the last recording of a certificate of lien under subsection B of this section, the collector may issue a warrant for the enforcement of any liens and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter. The warrant shall be directed to the chief of police and shall have the same effect as a writ of execution. The warrant shall be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same manner and with the same effect as a levy and sale pursuant to a writ of execution.

For purposes of apportionment as may be required by law, the collector may promulgate administrative procedures for apportionment in accordance with state law. 
( Ord. No. 484 , § 1, 7-24-2017) 
5.30.180 - Constitutionality and legality.

If such person, after written demand by the collector, refuses to make available for audit, examination or verification such books, records or equipment as the collector requests, the collector may, after full consideration of all information within his or her knowledge concerning the commercial cannabis businesses and activities of the person so refusing, make an assessment against the commercial cannabis business of the taxes estimated to be due under this chapter. The collector may collect a fee adopted by the city council to pay for the cost of examination and audit should the books and records be provided in a form insufficient to allow the collector to make a determination of tax due. 
B.  It shall be the duty of every person liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of at least three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the collector shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

5.30.210 - Change of ownership. 
A.  If any person, while liable for any amount under this chapter, sells, assigns or otherwise transfers the commercial cannabis business, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the person's successor, assignee or other transferee, or other person or entity obtaining ownership or control of the business ("transferee"), shall satisfy any tax liability owed to the city associated with the business when due hereunder. Failure to do so for the benefit of the city will result in being personally liable to the city for the full amount of the unpaid tax liability, interest and penalties. The transferee shall notify the collector of the date of transfer at least thirty days before the transfer date; or if the agreement to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the business was made less than thirty days before the date of transfer, notice shall be provided immediately upon the existence of the agreement. All transferees are required to meet each and every condition outlined in this chapter and have prior written approval of the city prior to the transfer. 
B.  The transferee shall be deemed to have complied with the requirement of this section to satisfy the unpaid tax liability if the transferee complied with the requirements of California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7283.5 by withholding from the purchase price, for the benefit of the city, an amount sufficient to cover the tax liability, or by otherwise paying the tax liability and obtaining from the collector a "tax clearance certificate" showing that all outstanding tax liability has been paid and stating that no amount is due through the date of transfer. 
C.  The collector, within ninety days of receiving a written request from the transferee, may issue a "tax clearance certificate" stating either the amount of tax liability due and owing for the business, or stating that there is no tax liability due and owing for the business through a stated date. The collector may also request financial records from the current or former owner or operator of a commercial cannabis business to audit the tax that may be due and owing. The collector shall issue a "tax clearance certificate" within thirty days of completing the audit, state the amount of the tax liability owed, if any, unless the collector determines that the records provided in connection with the audit are insufficient to determine whether taxes are due and owed or in what amount. If the collector determines that the records are insufficient, the collector may rely on the facts and information available to estimate any tax liability. The collector may issue a "tax clearance certificate" stating the amount of the tax liability, if any, based on such facts and information available. Unless an appeal is filed in accordance with Section 5.30.270, the "tax clearance certificate" shall serve as conclusive evidence of the tax liability associated with the property through the date stated on the "tax clearance certificate." 
( Ord. No. 484 , § 1, 7-24-2017) 
5.30.220 - Payment of taxes does not authorize unlawful business.

One or more deficiency determinations of the amount of tax due for a period or periods may be made. When a person discontinues engaging in a business, a deficiency determination may be made at any time within three years thereafter, or such later date as allowable by law, as to any liability arising from engaging in such business whether or not a deficiency determination is issued prior to the date the tax would otherwise be due.

Sections: 

8.16.010 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  The city council of the city of Farmersville does hereby find that it is necessary to provide for the abatement of conditions which are offensive or annoying to the senses, detrimental to property values and community appearance, an obstruction to or interference with the comfortable enjoyment of adjacent property or premises, or hazardous or injurious to the health, safety or welfare of the general public in such ways to constitute a nuisance; and to provide standards to safeguard life, health and public welfare in keeping with the character of the city by allowing for the maintenance of property or premises for each of the following purposes: 
1.  To safeguard the health, safety and welfare of the people maintaining property or premises in good and appropriate condition; 
2.  To promote a sound and attractive community appearance; and 
3.  To enhance the economic value of the community, and each area in it, through the regulation of the maintenance of property or premises. 
B.  Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purpose of this chapter is to: 
1.  Reduce the threat to health, safety, welfare, and appearance and economic value due to the decline in property condition(s) by lawfully delineating the circumstances under which such condition(s) may be considered illegal and/or abated; and further finds that,

Chapter 9.18 - GRAFFITI 
Sections: 

9.18.010 - Purpose. 
A.  Graffiti Abatement. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the prompt abatement of graffiti from public and private properties in the city; to provide for methods of controlling the unauthorized use of aerosol paint containers, wide-tipped marker pens, and paint sticks by minors; and to encourage citizens to report occurrences of graffiti vandalism within the city. 
B.  Nuisance Declared. Due to the increase of graffiti vandalism on both public and private property, a condition has arisen within the city which has resulted in a deterioration of property values and concern for the quality of life of the city's citizens. The city council finds and determines that graffiti constitutes a public nuisance which, left unabated, adversely affects the city's image, business development, retail sales, and residential housing costs. Allowing graffiti to remain on public or private property encourages additional unacceptable occurrences of graffiti, fuels fear among the community and is a factor which not only depreciates the value of the property which has been the target of such vandalism, but also depreciates the value of adjacent and surrounding properties. 
C.  Minimize Impact. The purpose of this chapter is, therefore, to minimize the impact which graffiti has on the city's quality of life, economic stability, environmental image, aesthetic standard, and the overall sense of feeling of safety and security of its citizens. Because the existence of graffiti tends to breed community discontent and criminal and gang-related activities, the chapter will serve to mitigate these problems through quick removal and control of graffiti vandalism. 
(Ord. 421 (part), 2006)

    "Graffiti" defined as, but not limited to, any unauthorized inscription, work, figure or design that is marked, etched, scratched, drawn or painted on any surface. 
    "Graffiti implement" defined as, but not limited to, aerosol containers of paint, any felt-tip marker, any paint stick, or any other item used to mark, etch, scratch, draw, or paint any unauthorized inscription, work, figure or design.

B.  Public Property. Whenever the city manager, or his/her designated representative, determines that graffiti exists upon property owned by the city, it shall be removed as soon as possible. When the property is owned by a public entity other than the city, the removal of the graffiti may be authorized by the city manager, or his/her designated representative, and removal undertaken by city only after securing written consent of the public entity having jurisdiction over the property. The public entity shall execute a release and waiver as approved by the city's risk manager. 
C.  Multiple Offenses. The city may, at its sole discretion, require any owner of property who has been cited two times or more for graffiti removal to, in addition to any other penalties/fines applicable under this chapter, plant vegetation or to take any other reasonable measures necessary to prevent or restrict the ability to create graffiti on the property in question. 
D.  Notice of Affected Area; Requirement to Remove Graffiti. 
1.  Where graffiti is located upon private property and said graffiti is capable of being viewed by persons utilizing any public right-of-way or sidewalk within the city, it is the property owner's duty to remove said graffiti promptly from the property and to restore said property at least to the condition it was in prior to such act of vandalism. If the property owner fails to promptly remove said graffiti, the city shall cause a written notice to be served upon the owner of the affected property notifying the owner of the location and description of the graffiti and of the property owner's obligation to remove said graffiti. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to commence removal of the graffiti described in the notice within five days of service or personal delivery of the notice, and to diligently and promptly pursue total removal of said graffiti; provided that an exception may exist in cases of undue hardship as established pursuant to subsection (D)(2) of this section. The service is complete at the time of deposit of the notice in the U.S. mail or by personal delivery of the notice to the owner of the property subject to removal of graffiti. The failure of any person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceeding. 
2.  Undue Hardship; Optional Procedure for Removal. In the event the property owner cannot comply with the requirement of subsection (D)(1) of this section, due to hardship, the property owner shall file a written request for waiver of the removal requirement with the city. The property owner shall explain his/her reason(s) for making such request. The written request shall be filed within the five-day removal period stated in subsection (D)(1) of this section. In determining whether the request for waiver will be granted, and subsequent assistance provided to the property owner in removal of said graffiti, the city shall consider the following circumstances: 
a.  The cost of restoration of the property to its original state prior to the imposition of the graffiti in proportion to the relative value of the property; 
b.  The ability of the owner to pay for such removal; 
c.  Whether or not the property has been the target of previous incidents of graffiti or whether a pattern of vandalism to such property exists. 
    The decision of the city in the form of a written decision by the city manager, as to whether or not to grant the waiver shall be final. 
3.  City's Release from Liability. A written request to waive the requirements of subsection (D)(1) of this section shall be accompanied by a "release from liability" form signed by the property owner which shall release the city and its authorized agents from any and all liability that may be caused or attributed to removal of graffiti from the owner's premises by persons acting under the authorization of the city. 
4.  Approval for City to Remove Graffiti. A written request to waive the requirements of subsection (D)(1) of this section accompanied by a signed "release from liability" form shall constitute an express approval by the property owner that the city or its authorized representatives may provide for the removal of the graffiti on owner's property by persons acting under the authorization of the city. 
5.  Failure to Remove Graffiti or Seek Waiver of Removal. In the event the owner fails to remove graffiti from his or her property and fails to request a waiver of such removal, the city may declare the property a public nuisance and the city may take any of the following courses of action: 
a.  Administrative Procedure to Abate Nuisance. The city may direct the removal of graffiti from the property with the cost of work performed billed to the property owner who may select the option of direct payment of such costs. Failure to make direct payment for the abatement of graffiti shall constitute a special assessment against the respective lot or parcel plat to which it relates. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. Upon completion of the graffiti abatement work, the city manager shall cause to be recorded in the office of the recorder of Tulare County, a "notice of completion of graffiti abatement proceedings" against a particular parcel involved. The notice of completion of graffiti abatement proceedings shall have the effect when recorded of conclusively establishing that graffiti abatement proceedings have been completed and that all proceedings have been completed and that all necessary charges incurred on account thereof by the city are due and owing and constitute a special assessment against the subject real property. This notice shall specify the name of the current owner of the parcel as shown on the last equalized assessment rolls of the county of Tulare, and the Tulare County Assessor's parcel number for the parcel involved. 
b.  The city may commence criminal proceedings to abate a public nuisance under applicable Penal Code provisions.

9.18.070 - Appeal of cost of removal. 
    A property owner shall have fifteen days from the date of mailing by the city of the bill for the cost of removal of graffiti from the owner's property to file a written appeal of said costs. Said appeal must be submitted in writing to the city clerk. Upon receipt of the written appeal, the city clerk shall schedule a hearing before the city council. The city manager shall be so notified and shall submit a written report to the city council, with a copy to the appealing party, setting forth justifications for the description of the work done and the cost thereof. The city clerk shall notify the party appealing of the date and time of the hearing before the city council, at least ten days in advance of such hearing. At the time and place of such hearing, the city manager shall present his report and the appealing party shall present any and all information in opposition to the calculation of the cost of removal.

Sections:

 Prior ordinance history: Ordinances 250, 329 and 338. 

10.64.010 - Definitions. 
    Unless the context otherwise requires, the definitions of words and phrases set forth in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter. 
A.  "Abandoned vehicle" includes the following: 
    "Public nuisance vehicle" means any vehicle that is abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or any inoperative parts thereof; and that creates a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, promotes blight and deterioration, invites plundering, creates fire hazards, constitutes an attractive nuisance endangering the health and safety of minors, harbors rodents and insects, or jeopardizes health, safety and general welfare. 
    "Abandoned vehicle." A vehicle is "abandoned" if is left on a highway, public property, or private property in such inoperable or neglected condition that the owner's intention to relinquish all further rights or interests in it may be reasonably concluded. 
    In reference to highways or public rights-of-way, "abandonment" is presumed to have occurred if a vehicle is parked, resting or otherwise immobilized on any highway or public right-of-way; and lacks an engine, transmission, wheels, tires, doors, windshield, or any other part or equipment necessary to operate safely on the highway. Such vehicles are presumed to be a hazard to public health, safety and welfare and may be removed immediately upon discovery by a peace officer or other designated employee. 
    "Wrecked vehicle" means any vehicle that is damaged to such an extent that it cannot be operated upon the highway. A vehicle which has been wrecked in a traffic accident, and which has been removed from the roadway to a storage facility, but which has not been claimed by its owner will not be considered an abandoned vehicle. 
    "Dismantled vehicle" means any vehicle that is partially or wholly disassembled. 
    "Inoperative vehicle" means any motor vehicle that cannot be moved under its own power. 
B.  "Employee" means a city employee designated by the city manager. 
C.  "Highway" means a way or place of whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular traffic. Highway includes a street, and all or any part of the entire width of the right-of-way of said highway. 
D.  "Peace officer" means an individual as defined in Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 830) of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code. 
E.  "Vehicle" is a device in, upon, or by which any person or property is or may be propelled, moved or drawn upon a highway, excepting a device moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks.

    In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the state under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts as public nuisances, the city council makes the following findings and declarations: 
    The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts, on private or public property, including highways, creates a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, promotes blight and deterioration, invites plundering, creates fire hazards, constitutes an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, creates a harborage for rodents and insects and is injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts, on private or public property, including highways, is declared to constitute a nuisance which may be abated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

Part III - TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT 
Chapter 10.84 - TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 
Sections: 

10.84.010 - Policy and purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to promote the development of transportation demand management (TDM) programs at new employer worksites with fifty or more employees in order to reduce traffic impacts and improve air quality within the city. In order to accomplish that purpose, this chapter establishes certain reporting requirements to enable the city to evaluate the effectiveness of existing TDM programs and to chart progress citywide toward achieving the average vehicle ridership goals established in this chapter. It is also the purpose of this chapter to require certain employers to designate specified individuals to ensure the proper coordination of such reporting and implementation programs. 
B.  This chapter is intended to meet the requirements of Assembly Bills 1791 and 471, which mandate the development of a trip reduction and travel demand element of the Congestion Management Program adopted by the Tulare County Association of Governments/Transportation Planning Agency (TCAG/TPA). Further, the legislation requires all local agencies to prepare and adopt a TDM ordinance. 
C.  New office, commercial, industrial and multiuse development, including employment centers which employ the minimum number of persons set by this chapter may adversely impact existing transportation and parking facilities, resulting in increased motor vehicle emissions, deteriorating levels of service, and possibly significant additional capital expenditures to augment and improve the existing transportation system. 
(Ord. 358 § 1(1)(part), 1992) 
10.84.020 - Findings. 
A.  Traffic counts and engineering evaluations indicate that traffic congestion on regional streets and highways has risen, particularly during peak periods, and is projected to increase; 
B.  Federal and state air quality standards have been and continue to be exceeded in the region; 
C.  Increases in traffic cause increased air pollution and noise, fuel waste, vehicle wear, time losses and inconvenience, and thus negatively affect the quality of life and the economic health of the community; 
D.  The use of alternative work hours and alternatives to single-occupant vehicle travel, especially at peak periods, will reduce traffic congestion, parking demand and related air pollution, noise, fuel use, vehicle wear, time loss and inconvenience, thus making the city a more desirable and healthful place to live, work, visit and do business; 
E.  Transportation demand management (TDM) programs conducted by employers, and transportation management associations (TMAs), are reasonable, flexible and effective ways of increasing employee use of commute alternatives, thereby reducing the number of peak period single-occupant commuter trips; 
F.  To ensure that employer TDM programs reduce the number of peak period commuter trips and single-occupant vehicles, it is necessary to require all employers who employ or will likely employ fifty or more daytime employees at a worksite to achieve and maintain certain employee participation and vehicle occupancy rates; 
G.  State law establishing requirements for development of a countywide Congestion Management Program (AB 471 and 1791) mandates the inclusion of a trip reduction and travel demand element/ordinance; 
H.  Various efforts underway including the Congestion Management Program (CMP) recognize and encourage the use of transportation demand management (TDM) strategies to increase mobility and improve the general efficiency of the transportation system by enhancing vehicle flow and shifting demand on existing transportation facilities; and 
I.  Other trip reduction program requirements have been adopted for the region and are included in the 1992 SJVUAPCD AQAP.

Unless Government Code Section 65964, as may be amended, authorizes the city to issue a permit with a shorter term, a permit for any wireless telecommunications facility shall be valid for a period of ten years, unless pursuant to another provision of this code it lapses sooner or is revoked. At the end of ten years from the date of issuance, such permit shall automatically expire. 
B.  A permittee may apply for a new permit within one hundred eighty days prior to expiration. Said application and proposal shall comply with the city's current code requirements for wireless telecommunications facilities. 
( Ord. No. 478 , § 1, 9-12-2016) 
12.18.150 - Cessation of use or abandonment. 
A.  A wireless telecommunications facility is considered abandoned and shall be promptly removed as provided herein if it ceases to provide wireless telecommunications services for ninety or more consecutive days unless the permittee has obtained prior written approval from the director which shall not be unreasonably denied.

3.  Acting on any bond or other assurance required by this article or conditions of approval of the permit; 
4.  Removal of the facilities by the city in accordance with the procedures established under this code for abatement of a public nuisance at the owner's expense; and/or

B.  Failure of the permittee, owner or operator to promptly remove its facility and restore the property within ninety days after expiration, earlier termination or revocation of the permit, or abandonment of the facility, shall be a violation of this code.

1.  Prosecution; 
2.  Acting on any security instrument required by this chapter or conditions of approval of permit; 
3.  Removal of the facilities by the city in accordance with the procedures established under this code for abatement of a public nuisance at the owner's expense; and/or

Written notice of the removal shall include the basis for the removal and shall be served upon the permittee and person who owns the facility within five business days of removal and all property removed shall be preserved for the owner's pick-up as feasible. If the owner cannot be identified following reasonable effort or if the owner fails to pick-up the property within sixty days, the facility shall be treated as abandoned property. 
D.  Removal of Facilities by City. In the event the city removes a facility in accordance with nuisance abatement procedures or summary removal, any such removal shall be without any liability to the city for any damage to such facility that may result from reasonable efforts of removal. In addition to the procedures for recovering costs of nuisance abatement, the city may collect such costs from the performance bond posted and to the extent such costs exceed the amount of the performance bond, collect those excess costs in accordance with this code. Unless otherwise provided herein, the city has no obligation to store such facility. Neither the permittee, owner nor operator shall have any claim if the city destroys any such facility not timely removed by the permittee, owner or operator after notice, or removed by the city due to exigent circumstances. 
( Ord. No. 478 , § 1, 9-12-2016) 
12.18.170 - Exceptions. 
A.  The city council recognizes that federal law prohibits a permit denial when it would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services and the applicant proposes the least intrusive means to provide such services. The city council finds that, due to wide variation among wireless facilities, technical service objectives and changed circumstances over time, a limited exemption for proposals in which strict compliance with this chapter would effectively prohibit personal wireless services serves the public interest. The city council further finds that circumstances in which an effective prohibition may occur are extremely difficult to discern, and that specified findings to guide the analysis promotes clarity and the city's legitimate interest in well-planned wireless facilities deployment. Therefore, in the event that any applicant asserts that strict compliance with any provision in this chapter, as applied to a specific proposed personal wireless services facility, would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services, the planning commission may grant a limited, one-time exemption from strict compliance subject to the provisions in this section. 
B.  Required Findings. The planning commission shall not grant any exemption unless the applicant demonstrates with clear and convincing evidence all the following: 
1.  The proposed wireless facility qualifies as a "personal wireless services facility" as defined in United States Code, Title 47, Section 332(c)(7)(C)(ii); 
2.  The applicant has provided the city with a clearly defined technical service objective and a clearly defined potential site search area; 
3.  The applicant has provided the city with a meaningful comparative analysis that includes the factual reasons why any alternative location(s) or design(s) suggested by the city or otherwise identified in the administrative record, including but not limited to potential alternatives identified at any public meeting or hearing, are not technically feasible or potentially available; and 
4.  The applicant has provided the city with a meaningful comparative analysis that includes the factual reasons why the proposed location and design deviates is the least noncompliant location and design necessary to reasonably achieve the applicant's reasonable technical service objectives. 
C.  Scope. The planning commission shall limit its exemption to the extent to which the applicant demonstrates such exemption is necessary to reasonably achieve its reasonable technical service objectives. The planning commission may adopt conditions of approval as reasonably necessary to promote the purposes in this chapter and protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
D.  Independent Consultant. The city shall have the right to hire, at the applicant's expense, an independent consultant to evaluate issues raised by the exception and to submit recommendations and evidence in response to the application. 
( Ord. No. 478 , § 1, 9-12-2016) 
12.18.180 - Location restrictions. 
    Locations Requiring an Exception. Wireless telecommunications facilities are strongly disfavored in certain areas. Therefore the following locations are permitted when an exception has been granted pursuant to Section 12.18.170: 
A.  Public right-of-way of local streets as identified in the general plan if within the residential zones; 
B.  Public right-of-way if mounted to a new pole that is not replacing an existing pole in an otherwise permitted location. 
( Ord. No. 478 , § 1, 9-12-2016) 
12.18.190 - Effect on other ordinances. 
    Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not relieve a person from complying with any other applicable provision of this code. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this chapter and other sections of this code, this chapter shall control. 
( Ord. No. 478 , § 1, 9-12-2016) 
12.18.200 - State or federal law. 
A.  In the event it is determined by the city attorney that state or federal law prohibits discretionary permitting requirements for certain wireless telecommunications facilities, such requirement shall be deemed severable and all remaining regulations shall remain in full force and effect. Such a determination by the city attorney shall be in writing with citations to legal authority and shall be a public record. For those facilities, in lieu of a minor conditional use permit or a conditional use permit, a ministerial permit shall be required prior to installation or modification of a wireless telecommunications facility, and all provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to any such facility with the exception that the required permit shall be reviewed and administered as a ministerial permit by the director rather than as a discretionary permit. Any conditions of approval set forth in this provision or deemed necessary by the director shall be imposed and administered as reasonable time, place and manner rules. 
B.  If subsequent to the issuance of the city attorney's written determination pursuant to subsection A above, the city attorney determines that the law has changed and that discretionary permitting is permissible, the city attorney shall issue such determination in writing with citations to legal authority and all discretionary permitting requirements shall be reinstated. The city attorney's written determination shall be a public record. 
C.  All installations permitted pursuant to this chapter shall comply with all federal and state laws including but not limited to the American with Disabilities Act. 
( Ord. No. 478 , § 1, 9-12-2016) 
12.18.210 - Nonconforming wireless telecommunications facilities in the right-of-way. 
A.  Nonconforming wireless telecommunications facilities are those facilities that do not conform to this chapter. 
B.  Nonconforming wireless telecommunications facilities shall, within ten years from the date such facility becomes nonconforming, be brought into conformity with all requirements of this article; provided, however, that should the owner desire to expand or modify the facility, intensify the use, or make some other change in a conditional use, the owner shall comply with all applicable provisions of this code at such time, to the extent the city can require such compliance under federal and state law. 
C.  An aggrieved person may file an appeal to the city council of any decision of the director made pursuant to this section. In the event of an appeal alleging that the ten-year amortization period is not reasonable as applied to a particular property, the city council may consider the amount of investment or original cost, present actual or depreciated value, dates of construction, amortization for tax purposes, salvage value, remaining useful life, the length and remaining term of the lease under which it is maintained (if any), and the harm to the public if the structure remains standing beyond the prescribed amortization period, and set an amortization period accordingly for the specific property. 
( Ord. No. 478 , § 1, 9-12-2016)

The exclusive-use of any park for activities consisting of twenty-five or more persons (whether spectators or participants) is prohibited without the issuance of a permit, except for athletic fields, in which case no exclusive use of any park for assemblies or groups consisting of ten or more persons may be made without the issuance of a permit. 
B.  All applications for exclusive-use of any park must be signed or co-signed by an adult who must agree to be responsible for the exclusive-use applied for. No exclusive-use permit will be granted if, prior to the time the application was filed, the city scheduled a city-sponsored event at the same time and place as the activity proposed in the application.

(Ord. No. 449 , § 2, 2-28-2011) 
12.22.040 - Approval or denial of permit application. 
A.  The city manager shall grant or deny such application within seven days after the filing of the application unless the time for such granting or denial of the permit has been waived by the applicant in writing or unless the size or nature of the event necessitates a review by the chief of police or another city department or officer.

(Ord. No. 449 , § 2, 2-28-2011) 
12.22.050 - Permit-Grant conditions-Crowd control. 
A.  The city manager shall grant the application when it complies with the standards and guidelines in Sections 12.22.080 through 12.22.180, and upon granting any permit may impose reasonable requirements and conditions concerning the use of the park by the applicant based upon Sections 12.22.080 through 12.22.180. The city manager, upon the written advice of the chief of police that the size and activity of the expected crowd will require police personnel from other areas of the city for crowd control and leave such other areas of the city unprotected, must impose a requirement of at least one crowd-control monitor per one hundred persons expected to attend the proposed activity so that the city manager shall require a one-hour training program to be conducted by the chief of police or his/her designee for the crowd-control monitors at a reasonable time and place prior to the proposed activity, which time and place shall be set by the city manager or her/his designee. The applicant shall, within two days of the receipt of the city manager's decision, supply to the city manager a list of the proposed crowd-control monitors, including their names, addresses and telephone numbers. The applicant may, at her/his option, provide reserve police personnel or duly licensed private patrolmen, instead of crowd-control monitors, in the number approved by the city manager and chief of police.

(Ord. No. 449 , § 2, 2-28-2011) 
12.22.060 - Permit-Grant for another location. 
A.  The city manager may grant the application for a park other than that applied for with the consent of the applicant in the event that a permit has already been issued for said park or said park does not meet the needs of applicant or is otherwise unsuitable pursuant to Sections 12.22.080 through 12.22.180. In the event that more than one application is received for one park for use on the same day, the city manager shall first act upon the application first received, however, the priorities for usage as designated Sections 12.22.080 through 12.22.180 shall apply. 
B.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, the granting of an application for an exclusive-use permit pursuant to this chapter does not guarantee that the park or portion thereof will be available for use on the date to be used. If a park, or portion thereof, for which an exclusive-use permit has been issued becomes unavailable for use due to construction, repairs or any other purpose or condition that in the opinion of the city manager renders the otherwise permitted use unsafe or an interference with construction or repairs, the city manager may change the scope of the permit or change the location of the event to another available park or portion thereof. The city manager and public works personnel shall make reasonable efforts to schedule construction, repairs and maintenance of parks and portions thereof to accommodate their use when a permit has been obtained six or more months in advance and shall make reasonable efforts to notify, as early as reasonably practicable, those persons who have obtained such permits when planned repairs and maintenance could render the park or portion thereof unusable.

1.  That the application reveals that the city has no park which will accommodate the activity of the applicant pursuant to the standards and guidelines contained in this chapter; 
2.  That the proposed activity is of a size or nature that requires the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the city to properly police the areas as to hinder police protection to other portions of the city; 
3.  That the applicant has failed to agree to provide a reasonable means of informing all of the persons participating in the proposed activity of the terms and conditions of such permits; 
4.  That the applicant fails to file a timely application, unless waived by the city manager and the applicant waives all right of appeal. 
5.  That the applicant has made a material misrepresentation in the permit application or in prior applications. 
B.  Such denial shall specify the grounds therefor. 
(Ord. No. 449 , § 2, 2-28-2011) 
12.22.080 - Standards and guidelines-Intent. 
    A schedule of fees and charges for use of parks shall be adopted and periodically amended by resolution of the city council as part of the city's master fee schedule to establish and regulate the fees, charges and priority for use of city parks. 
    It is further the intent of the city council and the policy that city residents and organizations receive preferential privileges of use over persons and organizations from outside the city.

(Ord. No. 469 , § 2, 5-11-2015) 
13.06.035 - Enforcement-Violation-Penalty. 
(a)  Enforcement objectives: It is one of the objectives of the city council that Farmersville water consumers are encouraged to voluntarily comply with the provisions of this chapter. In furtherance of said objectives, the enforcement of this chapter will permit the issuance of a first warning of violation of this chapter, by way of a written notice of violation to the water user, before the issuance of a citation for further violations. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person other than the city who violates any provision of this chapter shall be punishable under, and subject all of the various enforcement remedies authorized in, Section 1.12.010 of the Farmersville Municipal Code, to the extent permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 469 , § 2, 5-11-2015) 
13.06.040 - Public nuisance declared. 
    In addition to any other remedies which may otherwise be available to the city, the city council makes the following findings and declarations: 
(a)  The waste of water, as that term is defined herein, on public or private property within the city or any extended service area property receiving city water service, is found to contribute to and compound drought conditions which may, from time to time, exist within the city, to the detriment of one of our most precious, essential and finite resources, water. Such conditions cause injury to the health, safety and/or general welfare of the citizens of Farmersville. 
(b)  Therefore, the waste of water within the city or its extended service areas, on private or public property, except as expressly permitted within this chapter, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may, as could any other violation of this chapter by a consumer, be abated in any lawful manner including, without limitation, under the procedures of Chapter 8.08 of the Farmersville Municipal Code or by way of any appropriate action brought by the city attorney in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(c)  Except to the extent otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, each enforcement remedy available for a consumer's violation of this chapter shall be cumulative and not mutually exclusive of other available enforcement remedies. 
(Ord. No. 469 , § 2, 5-11-2015) 
13.06.045 - Enforcement officers. 
    All police officers and persons authorized by law to issue citations within the city shall, in conjunction with the duties imposed upon them by law, diligently enforce the provisions of this chapter and, to the extent permitted by state law, enforce any state statutes and regulations relating in any way to drought conditions or water conservation, including without limitation Title 23 California Code of Regulations, section 864. 
    All employees of the city are encouraged to notify the public works department of any perceived violations of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 469 , § 2, 5-11-2015) 
13.06.050 - Application for exemption. 
    For hardship cases only, exemptions may be granted for any of the above regulations upon application in writing stating, in detail, the circumstances warranting special consideration. A written appeal from any decisions made by the public works director must be timely filed with the city clerk within ten days and shall be heard by the city council or its designee.

13.07.050 - Special groundwater protection. 
    The enforcement agency may designate areas where groundwater quality problems are known to exist and where a well will penetrate more than one aquifer. The enforcement agency may require in these designated areas special well seal(s) to prevent mixing of water from several aquifers. Where an applicant proposes well construction, reconstruction, or destruction work in such an area, the enforcement agency may require the applicant to provide a report prepared by a registered geologist or registered civil engineer (California Business and Professions Code Sections 7850 and 6762 respectively) that identifies all strata containing poor quality water and recommends the location and specifications of the seal or seals needed to prevent the entrance of poor- quality water or its migration into other aquifers. 
(Ord. 343 § 5, 1989) 
13.07.060 - Inspections. 
    The enforcement agency shall make an inspection of the annular seal construction work. It may make an initial inspection of each proposed drilling site, an inspection at the completion of the work, and inspections at such other times as it deems appropriate. 
A.  Initial Inspection. Upon receipt of an application, the enforcement agency may make an inspection of the drilling site prior to the issuance of a well permit. The purpose of this inspection is to determine whether there are any site conditions such that the enforcement agency shall do the following: 
1.  Relocation of Drilling Site. Require relocation of the drilling site should the location shown on the permit application be too close to potential sources of pollution; 
2.  Additional Conditions. Set additional conditions if needed to remediate any previously known groundwater quality protection problems. 
B.  Inspection of Well Seal. The enforcement agency shall inspect the annular space grout depth prior to the sealing. 
1.  Required Notice. The enforcement agency shall be notified by the well driller a minimum of twenty-four hours prior to sealing the annular space. Drillers who anticipate completing a well in less than one day shall notify the enforcement agency twenty-four hours prior to commencement of drilling and provide the anticipated time to commence the sealing of the annular space. 
2.  Should the Enforcement Agency Fail to be Present. If the enforcement agency wishes to allow a seal to be tremied or placed without inspection, the driller shall seal the well in accordance with the standards of this chapter and any permit conditions. No seal shall be tremied or placed until permission to proceed is given. 
C.  Final Inspection. If requested by the enforcement agency, the driller shall notify the enforcement agency within seven days of the completion of their work at each drilling site. The enforcement agency may make a final inspection after completion of the work to determine whether the well was completed in accordance with this chapter. 
D.  Waiver of Inspections. The enforcement agency may waive inspections should any of the following conditions exist. 
1.  Well Inspected by Other Agencies. Inspections may be waived where the work will be inspected by the staff of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board or the California Department of Health Services if these designated agencies will inspect and report to the enforcement agency on all drilling features required by the standards. 
2.  Monitoring Wells under Specified Conditions. Inspections may be waived for monitoring wells that will penetrate only aquifers containing degraded waters or will penetrate only formations that normally contain no water. 
3.  Drilling Sites Known to Have No Threats to Groundwater Quality. Initial inspections may be waived when the drilling site is well known to the enforcement agency staff and it is known that no significant threats to groundwater quality exist in the area. 
(Ord. 343 § 6, 1989) 
13.07.070 - Completion reports. 
    The driller shall provide the enforcement agency with a complete report within thirty days of the completion of any well construction, reconstruction or destruction job. 
A.  Submittal of State "Report of Completion." A copy of the "report of completion" (water well driller's report, Department of Water Resources Form 188) required by California Water Code Section 13751 shall be submitted by the permittee to the enforcement agency within thirty days of construction, alteration, or destruction of any well. This report shall document that the work was completed in accordance with the standards and all additional permit conditions. This section shall not be deemed to release any person from the requirement to file such report with the state Department of Water Resources. 
B.  Confidentiality of Report.

(Ord. 303 § 1(part), 1986) 
16.18.050 - Application. 
A.  This chapter shall apply only to residential developments. Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by the this title, requires the filing of a tentative map or tentative parcel map for a residential development, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the rights conferred by the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. 
(Ord. 303 § 1(part), 1986) 
16.18.060 - Filing and processing. 
    A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in this title for a tentative map except as provided in this section:

A.  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2. However, if Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit, approval, extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined:

2.  The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law. 
C.  The rights referred to in this section shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 16.18.080. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time: 
1.  An initial time period of one and one-half years. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded;

(Ord. 303 § 1(part), 1986) 
16.18.100 - Development inconsistent with zoning-Conditional approval. 
A.  Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Section 16.18.090A, confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved. 
B.  The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in Section 16.18.090C. 
(Ord. 303 § 1(part), 1986)

D.  Any hearing conducted pursuant to this chapter need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence, witnesses and hearsay. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely upon in the conduct of serious affairs regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of the evidence over objection in civil actions. The city manager or designee has discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will necessitate undue consumption of time. 
E.  The city manager or designee may continue the administrative hearing from time to time. 
F.  The city manager or designee shall consider the matter de novo, and may affirm, reverse, or modify the determinations contained in the notice identifying the disputed violations.

( Ord. No. 485 , § 4, 11-13-2017) 
17.53.190 - Enforcement. 
A.  Whenever the enforcing officer becomes aware that an owner or occupant has failed to abate any cannabis violation within fourteen days of the date of service of the notice to abate, or if such notice was appealed, as of the date set by the city manager or designee requiring such abatement, if any, the enforcing officer may take one or more of the following actions: 
1.  Enter upon the parcel and abate the nuisance with city personnel, or by private contractor under the direction of the enforcing officer. The enforcing officer may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an abatement warrant authorizing entry upon the property for the purpose of undertaking the abatement work. If any part of the work is to be accomplished by a private contractor(s), a written estimate of the work shall be provided to the owners and occupants of the parcel. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that any contract be awarded under this chapter through competitive bidding procedures whenever such procedures are not required by the general laws of the State of California or this code; or

The owner may waive the hearing on the accounting by paying the cost of abatement and the cost of administration to the city clerk prior to the time set for the hearing by the city manager or designee. Unless otherwise expressly stated by the owner, payment of any costs of abatement and any costs of administration prior to said hearing shall be deemed a full waiver of the right to said hearing and a conclusive admission that said accounting is accurate and reasonable. 
( Ord. No. 485 , § 4, 11-13-2017) 
17.53.220 - Hearing on accounting. 
A.  At the time fixed, the city manager or designee shall meet to review the report of the enforcing officer. An owner may appear at said time and be heard on the question of whether the accounting, so far as it pertains to the cost of abating a nuisance upon the land of the owner, is accurate and the amounts reported are reasonable. The cost of administration shall also be reviewed. 
B.  The report of the enforcing officer shall be admitted into evidence. The owner(s) shall bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the accounting is not accurate and reasonable. 
( Ord. No. 485 , § 4, 11-13-2017)

17.53.240 - Special assessment and lien. 
    After the hearing on the accounting under Section 17.53.220, the city manager or designee may order that the cost of abatement of any nuisance pursuant to this chapter and the administrative costs as confirmed by the city manager or designee be recorded as a special assessment against the respective parcels of land and placed upon the secured county tax roll, or placed on the unsecured roll, pursuant to Section 38773.5 of the Government Code. However, the cost of abatement and the cost of administration as finally determined by the city manager or designee shall not be placed on any tax roll if paid in full prior to entry of said costs on the tax roll. The city manager or designee may also authorize or require that a notice of abatement lien be recorded against the respective parcels of real property pursuant to Section 38773.5(e) of the Government Code. 
( Ord. No. 485 , § 4, 11-13-2017) 
17.53.250 - Enforcement by civil action. 
    As an alternative to the procedures set forth in Sections 17.53.130 through 17.53.160, the city may abate the violation of this chapter by the prosecution of a civil action through the city attorney, including an action for injunctive relief. The remedy of injunctive relief may take the form of a court order, enforceable through civil contempt proceedings, prohibiting the maintenance of the violation of this chapter or requiring compliance with other terms. 
( Ord. No. 485 , § 4, 11-13-2017) 
17.53.260 - Summary abatement. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, when any cannabis violation constitutes an immediate threat to public health, security or safety, and when the procedures set forth in Sections 17.53.130 through 17.53.160 would not result in abatement of that nuisance within a short enough time period to avoid that threat, the enforcing officer may direct any officer or employee of the city to summarily abate the nuisance. The enforcing officer shall make reasonable efforts to notify the persons identified in Section 17.53.150, but the formal notice and hearing procedures set forth in this chapter shall not apply. Pursuant to Government Code Section 38773, the city may nevertheless recover its costs for abating that nuisance in the manner set forth in Sections 17.53.200 through 17.53.240. 
( Ord. No. 485 , § 4, 11-13-2017) 
17.53.270 - No duty to enforce. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as imposing on the enforcing officer or the city any duty to issue a notice to abate, nor to abate any cannabis violation, nor to take any other action with regard to any cannabis violation, and neither the enforcing officer nor the city shall be held liable for failure to issue an order to abate any cannabis violation, nor for failure to abate any cannabis violation, nor for failure to take any other action with regard to any cannabis violation.

Chapter 17.84 - SIGNS 
Sections: 

17.84.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for regulating signs, including the type, size, location and construction standards of signs by zone district. Signs have an obvious impact on the character and quality of the city. As a prominent part of the visual environment, they attract or repel the viewing public, affect the safety of vehicular traffic and their suitability or appropriateness helps to set the tone of the neighborhood. The objectives of this chapter include the following: 
A.  To reinforce that the sign should serve primarily to identify the general nature of an establishment or to direct attention to a project, activity, place, person, organization, or enterprise. 
B.  As identification devices, signs must not subject the citizens of the city to excessive competition for their visual attention. As appropriate identification devices, signs must harmonize with the building, the neighborhood, and other signs in the area. 
C.  The city of Farmersville intends to encourage the installation of signs that improve the appearance of the property and the neighborhood and to enhance the economic effectiveness of signs. 
D.  The provisions in this section provide standards to safeguard life, health, property, and public welfare in keeping with the character of the city of Farmersville by regulating the size, height, structural design, quality of materials, construction location, electrification, illumination and maintenance of all types of signs and sign structures. 
E.  The provisions in this chapter present criteria indicating whether or not signs conform to the above intentions of suitability and safety.

B.  Size. Notwithstanding applicable sign standards elsewhere in this chapter, sign size shall be proportionate to the size and scale of the site and building upon which the sign is proposed. Sign dimensions as specified in this chapter are maximum allowable dimensions; it may be necessary that signs be smaller than the maximum allowed in order to be proportionate in size and scale to achieve the design objectives of this section. 
C.  Commercial and Industrial Center Signs. Individual tenant signs within multi-tenant centers shall be coordinated in size, location, materials and illumination. 
D.  Color. Colors shall be used in coordinated groupings, and shall be compatible with those colors used in the building or project design. For cabinet-style signs, a dark sign background is preferred with light colored copy (characters/graphics). 
Exhibit 5: Selected Sign Design Criteria 

E.  Logos and Trademarks. The use of established corporate colors or logos shall not be prohibited by this section. When established corporate colors are incompatible with buildings colors, compatibility in design with the surrounding development should be accomplished through the use of appropriate background colors or other design features. 
F.  Lighting Intensity. The light emitted or reflected by a sign, or emitted by a light source, shall be of reasonable intensity and shall be compatible with the architecture of the building and the immediate vicinity. Artificial light sources shall be shielded to prevent light spillage, glare or annoyance to persons on or inside adjoining properties or to public or private rights-of-way. 
G.  Sign Bases and Frames. Freestanding signs shall be either housed in a frame, or set onto a base, presenting a solid, attractive, and well-proportioned appearance. The size and shape of the frame or base shall be proportionate to the size and mass of the sign and should be low-profile in design. Pole type signs are not permitted. Guy wires, angle irons, braces and other support or construction elements shall be screened or hidden from view. 
H.  Landscaping. Freestanding signs shall be located in a landscaped area proportionate to the size of the sign, but not less than twice the size of one side of the sign face. Appropriate accent landscaping should be placed at the base of the sign. 
I.  Sign Copy. Sign copy should be simple and concise without excessive description of services or products. On freestanding signs, sign copy should be designed to contribute to the design of the structure on which it is displayed. In all cases, freestanding sign design and sign copy should be coordinated to provide an attractively designed freestanding element which identifies the development or project. 
J.  Wall Signs. Building signs should be mounted flush against the building, and shall not project above the roof ridge or the top of the parapet. 
K.  Maintenance. All signs and their supporting members shall be kept in good repair and maintained in good structural condition at all times. 
L.  Design Quality. All signs shall be professionally designed and manufactured. Signs that utilize hand-made lettering or elements should be avoided. 
(Ord. 438 § 1(part), 2007) 
17.84.070 - Prohibited signs and locations. 
    Prohibited signs are as follows:

17.88.050 - Density bonuses. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of a density bonus is to encourage the private sector to construct affordable housing for "target households" as defined by the Government Code. A density bonus can be approved by Farmersville if a private sector housing developer agrees to construct a certain percentage of units for target households and agrees to maintain their affordability for a specific time period. 
Section 65915 of the State Government Code states that when an applicant seeks a density bonus for a housing development in Farmersville, the city shall provide the applicant incentives or concessions for the production of housing units, consistent with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Application and fees. An application for a density bonus shall be made to the planning department on a form prescribed by the department. The application shall be accompanied by a fee set by resolution of the city council. 
C.  Density bonus requirements. Government Code Section 65915 indicates that when an applicant seeks a density bonus for a housing development, the density bonus requirements are triggered when the residential development sets aside at least ten percent of the total units as affordable to low-income households; or at least five percent of the total units as affordable to very low-income households; at least ten percent of the total units as affordable for moderate-income households in a common-interest for sale development. Further a density bonus request may be made when at least ten percent of the units are designed as large family household units or all units are reserved for senior citizens, or for a mobile home park restricted to senior citizen residents. Finally a density bonus can be requested when a developer of affordable housing provides a site of at least one acre for the development of housing for target groups. 
1.  Development concessions or incentives that may be provided by the City of Farmersville include a reduction in site development standards; a modification of zoning code requirements (including a reduction in setbacks, square footage requirements, or parking spaces; or architectural design requirements which exceed the minimum building standards); approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development, and if such nonresidential uses are compatible with the project; or other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the City of Farmersville which result in identifiable cost reductions. The number of incentives will be based on the following project affordability factors: 
a.  For projects with at least five percent very low income, ten percent lower income, ten percent moderate income units, or ten percent large family units, one incentive or concession is required. 
b.  For projects with at least ten percent very low income, twenty percent lower income, twenty percent moderate income units, or twenty percent large family units, two incentives or concessions are required. 
c.  For projects with at least fifteen percent very low income, thirty percent lower income, thirty percent moderate income units, or thirty percent large family units, three incentives or concessions are required. 
2.  A project that receives a density bonus and concession or incentive must retain affordability of the units for at least thirty years. 
D.  Density bonus requirements for land donations. If an applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or some other type of residential development application donates land to Farmersville where very-low income housing can be developed, the developer shall be entitled to a minimum of fifteen percent increase above the allowable residential density under the zoning ordinance and land use element of the general plan. 
E.  Report and findings. The planning department shall prepare a report on the density bonus application. The department shall provide a recommendation based on the following density bonus requirements. 
1.  The housing development qualifies for a density bonus based on the requirements outlined in Government Code Sections 65915 to 65918, or for large family household units. 
2.  The applicant has provided to the city the legal instrument that will ensure that "target households" will remain affordable for at least thirty years. 
3.  The application has selected developer incentives or concessions. 
F.  Action of planning commission. Following the planning commission's review of the planning department's report on the applicant's request for a density bonus, the commission shall take action on the density bonus application based on the regulations contained in Government Code Sections 65915 to 65918. The commission can recommend approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the density bonus to the city council. Denial of a density bonus application shall require findings consistent with those in Government Code Sections 65915 to 65918. 
1.  The commission's recommendation shall be forwarded to the city council. 
2.  The commission's decision shall not be based on a finding that the housing project will be occupied by "target households" and that this condition may have an adverse impact on the neighborhood or community. 
3.  Within ten days of adopting a resolution on the density bonus, the planning department shall forward the commission's recommendation to the city council and shall transmit a copy of the commission's resolution to the applicant. 
G.  Action of the city council. The city council shall consider the planning commission's recommendation and shall take action on the density bonus application. The council can approve, approve with modifications, or deny the density bonus application. 
1.  Any modification of the proposed density bonus by the city council which is based on information not considered by the planning commission shall cause the density bonus application to be referred back to the commission for its reevaluation and recommendation. 
2.  The council's decision shall not be based on a finding that the housing project will be occupied by "target households" and that this condition may have an adverse impact on the neighborhood or community. 
H.  Density bonus housing agreement. Agreements, contracts, or other instruments between the city and the developer shall be required to ensure that "target households" shall remain affordable for the period of time agreed to by the city and the developer. Said agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the city attorney and shall be recorded with the Tulare County Recorders Office. 
I.  Density bonus calculations. The base density of a property for which a density bonus is being requested shall be determined by the property's zoning. The actual amount of the density bonus that may be granted for a particular project is set on a sliding scale, based upon the percentage of affordable units provided at each income level, as shown in Table 1.

B.  That because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of the zoning regulation is found to deprive the subject property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under the same zone classification. 
C.  That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity or the zone in which the subject property is located.

(Ord. 319 § 1(part), 1987) 
17.100.080 - Minor deviations. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a mechanism whereby minor deviations from district regulations can be granted by the planning director. A minor deviation may be granted for up to twenty percent of the regulations (except for minimum lot area) for the district in which the project is located. Any minor deviation that exceeds the deviation percentage explained above shall be processed as a variance consistent with the regulations detailed in Chapter 17.100 Variances, as shall any deviation from minimum lot area standards. 
    Minor deviations shall only be granted when practical difficulties, unnecessary hardships and conditions inconsistent with the purpose and objectives of this section may result from the strict application of certain provisions of this section. The granting of a minor deviation and its associated conditions shall not constitute a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in vicinity and in other like districts in Farmersville. 
B.  Applicability. The planning director may grant a minor deviation from district regulations, including setbacks, lot dimensions, height of structures and fences, walls and hedges, lot coverage, and parking standards. 
C.  Application and Fee. An application for a minor deviation shall be made to the planning department on a form prescribed by the department. The application shall be accompanied by a fee set by resolution of the city council. 
D.  Report and Findings. The city director shall prepare a report on the minor deviation application and shall review the following findings with regard to a minor deviation. 
1.  There are special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, and unclear property lines, where the strict application of this section deprives such property right possessed by other property in the same vicinity or other properties that have the same district classification; 
2.  That granting a minor deviation is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the same vicinity or other properties that have the same district classification; 
3.  That granting the minor deviation will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and district in which the property is located; and 
4.  That granting the minor deviation does not constitute a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and district in which the property is located. 
E.  Action of the Planning Director. Minor deviations may be processed as an administrative matter by the planning director. Following a review of a minor deviation application and the findings listed above, the planning director may take action on the minor deviation. The planning director can approve, approve with conditions or deny the minor deviation based on the findings listed above. Following a decision by the planning director, an administrative resolution shall be prepared that outlines the findings and conditions of the decision. 
    The director's decision shall be final unless appealed to the planning commission consistent with procedures contained in Section 17.100.050 (Appeals). Within ten days of approving the minor deviation, the director shall transmit a copy of the administrative agreement to the applicant. 
F.  Conditions. The director can approve a minor deviation subject to conditions. Conditions will assure that the approved minor deviations shall not constitute a grant of a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and district in which such property is situated. 
( Ord. No. 464 , §§ 22, 23, 7-28-2014) 
17.100.090 - Reasonable accommodations. 
A.  Applicability and Purpose. Reasonable accommodation in the land use and zoning context means providing individuals with disabilities or developers of housing for people with disabilities, flexibility in the application of land use and zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures, or even waiving certain requirements, when it is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities. 
    An individual with a disability is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or anyone with a record of such impairment. 
    A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any individual with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when the application of a land use, zoning or building regulation, policy, practice or procedure acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. 
B.  Notice to the Public of Availability of Accommodation Process. Notice of the availability of reasonable accommodation shall be prominently displayed at public information counters in city hall, advising the public of the availability of the procedure for eligible individuals. Forms for requesting reasonable accommodation shall be available to the public in city hall.

a.  The applicant's name, address, and telephone number; 
b.  Address of the property for which the request is being made; 
c.  The name and address of the property owner, and the owner's written consent to the application; 
d.  The current actual use of the property;

f.  The rule, policy, practice and/or procedure of the city for which the request for accommodation is being made, including the zoning code regulation from which reasonable accommodation is being requested; 
g.  The type of accommodation sought; 
h.  The reason(s) why the accommodation is reasonable and necessary for the needs of the disable person(s). Where appropriate, include a summary of any potential means and alternatives considered in evaluating the need for the accommodation; 
i.  Copies of memoranda, correspondence, pictures, plans or background information reasonably necessary to reach a decision regarding the need for the accommodation; and 
j.  Other supportive information deemed necessary by the city to facilitate proper consideration of the request, consistent with fair housing laws. 
3.  Any information identified by an applicant as confidential shall be retained in a manner so as to respect the privacy rights of the applicant and shall not be made available for public inspection. 
4.  A request for reasonable accommodation in regulations, policies, practices and procedures may be filed at any time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. A reasonable accommodation does not affect an individual's obligations to comply with other applicable regulations not at issue in the requested accommodation. 
5.  If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the jurisdiction will provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible. 
6.  Review with Other Land Use Applications. If the project for which the reasonable accommodation is being requested also requires some other discretionary approval (such as conditional use permit, architectural review, general plan amendment, zoning amendment, subdivision map), then the applicant shall submit the reasonable accommodation application first for a determination by the city planner, before proceeding with the other applications. 
7.  Fee. The fee for an application for reasonable accommodation shall be established by resolution of the city council. 
D.  Reviewing Authority. 
1.  Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the city planner, using the criteria set forth in subsection 17.100.090(E). Information related to an applicant's disability shall be kept in strict confidence in the city planner's office. 
2.  The city planner shall issue a written decision on a request for reasonable accommodation within thirty days of the date of the application and may either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with the required findings set forth in subsection 17.100.090(E). 
3.  If necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the city planner may request further information from the applicant consistent with fair housing laws, specifying in detail the information that is required. In the event that a request for additional information is made, the thirty-day period to issue a decision is stayed until the applicant responds to the request. 
E.  Required Findings. 
1.  The written decision to grant, grants with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation shall be consistent with fair housing laws and based on the following factors: 
a.  Whether the housing, which is the subject of the request for reasonable accommodation, will be used by an individual with disabilities protected under fair housing laws; 
b.  Whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual with disabilities protected under the fair housing laws; 
c.  Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city and; 
d.  Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city's land use and zoning or building program.

v.  Measures to reduce the impact on surrounding uses; 
vi.  Measures in consideration of the physical attributes of the property and structures; 
vii.  Other reasonable accommodations that may provide an equivalent level of benefit and that will not result in an encroachment into required setbacks, exceed the maximum height, lot coverage, or floor area ratio requirement specified for the zone district; and 
viii.  Other conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. 
F.  Written Decision on the Request for Reasonable Accommodation. 
1.  The written decision on the request for reasonable accommodation shall explain in detail the basis of the decision, including the reviewing authority's findings on the criteria set forth in subsection 17.100.090(E). All written decisions shall give notice of the applicant's right to appeal and to request reasonable accommodation in the appeals process as set forth below. The notice of decision shall be sent to the applicant by certified mail. 
2.  The written decision of the city planner shall be final unless an applicant appeals it to the city's planning commission within ten days of the date of the written decision by following the process found in subsection H of this section. 
3.  The city planner shall render a written decision on the request for reasonable accommodation within the sixty-day time period unless the city notifies the applicant in writing of an extension of the deadline for the city to render its decision. 
4.  While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect. 
G.  Appeals. 
1.  Within thirty days after the date on the city planner's written decision, an applicant may appeal an adverse decision to the planning commission. The planning commission's decision shall be final. However, in its sole and absolute discretion the city council (or its designee) reserves the right to hear or decline a request to hear an appeal of the planning commission's decision. Such a request to the city council must be submitted within ten days after the planning commission's decision. All appeals from an adverse decision must be made in writing and dated.

Title 18 - ENVIRONMENT 
Chapters: 
Chapter 18.04 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT* 
Sections: 
ARTICLE I - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

18.04.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Farmersville does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 442 § 1.1, 2008) 
18.04.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city of Farmersville are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. 
(Ord. 442 § 1.2, 2008) 
18.04.030 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 442 § 1.3, 2008) 
18.04.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas; and 
F.  These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances and codes. 
(Ord. 442 § 1.4, 2008) 
18.04.050 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    "A zone." See "Special flood hazard area." 
    "Accessory structure, low-cost and small" means a structure that is: 
1.  Solely for the parking of no more than two cars; or limited storage (small, low-cost sheds); and 
2.  Shall not exceed sixteen feet in height, nor cover more than thirty percent of the area of a required year yard. 
    "Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
    "Alluvial fan" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration. 
    "Apex" means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    "Area of special flood hazard." See "Special flood hazard area." 
    "Base flood" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter. 
    "Base flood elevation (BFE)" means the elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for zones AE, AH, AI-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade, i.e., below ground level, on all sides. 
    "Building." See "Structure." 
    "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    "Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before January 13, 1984. 
    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    "Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
    "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    "Flood, flooding, or floodwater" means: 
1.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 
2.  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
    "Floodplain administrator" is the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    "Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See "Flooding." 
    "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93. 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
    "Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
    "Fraud and victimization," as related to Article V of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    "Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
    "Hardship," as related to Article V of this chapter, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The flood openings standard in Section 18.04.170(C)(3); 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 18.04.170(A); 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 18.04.170(B); and 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 18.04.180. 
2.  For residential structures, all sub-grade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Market value" is defined in the city of Farmersville substantial damage/improvement procedures. See Section 18.04.140(B)(1). 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
    "New construction" for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after January 13, 1984 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after January 13, 1984. 
    "Obstruction" means and includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    "One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood." See "Base flood." 
    "Program deficiency" means a defect in a community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations. 
    "Public safety and nuisance," as related to Article V of this chapter, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
4.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    "Sheet flow area." See "Area of shallow flooding." 
    "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zones A, AO, AI-A30, AE, A99, or, AH. 
    "Start of construction" means and includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvements was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    "Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
(Ord. 442 § 2, 2008) 
ARTICLE II - AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD 

18.04.060 - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of city of Farmersville. 
(Ord. 442 § 3.1, 2008) 
18.04.070 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the City of Farmersville, June 15, 1983, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM's) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFM's), December 15, 1983, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city of Farmersville by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRM's and FBFM's are on file at 909 W. Visalia Road, Farmersville, CA 93223. 
(Ord. 442 § 3.2, 2008) 
18.04.080 - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. 442 § 3.3, 2008) 
18.04.090 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where the ordinance codified in this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. 442 § 3.4, 2008) 
18.04.100 - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
A.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
B.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
C.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. 442 § 3.5, 2008) 
18.04.110 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.

(Ord. 442 § 3.6, 2008) 
18.04.120 - Severability. 
    This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance codified in this chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 442 § 3.7, 2008) 
ARTICLE III - ADMINISTRATION 

18.04.130 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
    The building official, and in his absence the city manager, is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce the ordinance codified in this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(Ord. 442 § 4.1, 2008) 
18.04.140 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
    The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Farmersville; and 
5.  All Letters of Map Revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
B.  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication, FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value." 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
C.  Review Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 18.04.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article IV of this chapter. 
    Note: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995. 
D.  Notification of Other Agencies. 
1.  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
2.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
    Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
E.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Sections 18.04.170(C)(1) and 18.04.200 (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Section 18.04.170(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  Certification required by Section 18.04.170(C)(3) (wet floodproofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Section 18.04.190(A)(3) (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
5.  Certification required by Section 18.04.220(B) (floodway encroachments); and 
6.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
F.  Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 18.04.160. 
G.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 18.04.080. 
H.  Biennial Report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA. 
I.  Planning. Assure community's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. 
(Ord. 442 § 4.2, 2008) 
18.04.150 - Development permit. 
    A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development, including manufactured homes, within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 18.04.070. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the city of Farmersville. The applicant shall provide the following minimum information:

(Ord. 442 § 5.5, 2008) 
18.04.220 - Floodways. 
    Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones AI-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Farmersville. 
B.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city of Farmersville shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
C.  If subsections A and B of this section are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article IV of this chapter. 
(Ord. 442 § 5.6, 2008) 
ARTICLE V - VARIANCE PROCEDURE 

18.04.230 - Nature of variances. 
    The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
    The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. 442 § 6.1, 2008) 
18.04.240 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Articles III and IV of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 18.04.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the Tulare County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
F.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. 442 § 6.2, 2008) 
18.04.250 - Appeal board. 
A.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause "fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
C.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
D.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 18.04.240(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
