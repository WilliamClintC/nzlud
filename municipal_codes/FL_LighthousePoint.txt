PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Lighthouse Point, Florida. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, as supplemented through November 26, 1996, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CHTCT:1 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and William Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Frances S. Marsh, City Clerk, and Mr. Richard H. Roth, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(a)  Scope. There is hereby created the city's investment policy, which shall provide exclusive authorization, regulation, guidance and requirements pertaining to the investment activities of Lighthouse Point. These policies shall pertain only to those funds in excess of those required to meet the current expenses to be paid within 60 days. This policy shall not pertain to endowment or conditionally gifted special funds accepted by the city commission by ordinance, or to pension and bond funds where there are other policies or indenture requirements in effect. 
(b)  General objectives. The primary objectives, in priority order, of investment activities shall be safety, liquidity, and yield. 
(1)  Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk. 
a.  Credit risk. The city will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of the security insurer or backer, by: 
(i)  Limiting investments to the safest types of securities. 
(ii)  Pre-qualifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers, intermediaries, and advisors [with] which the city will do business. 
(iii)  Diversifying the investment portfolio so that potential losses on individual securities will be minimized. 
b.  Interest rate risk. The city will minimize the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general interest rates, by: 
(i)  Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity. 
(ii)  Investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term securities, money market mutual funds, or similar investment pools. 
(2)  Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands (static liquidity). Furthermore, since all possible demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity). A portion of the portfolio also may be placed in money market mutual funds or local government investment pools that offer same-day liquidity for short-term funds. 
(3)  Yield. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core of investments are limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall not be sold prior to maturity with the following exceptions: 
a.  A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal. 
b.  A security swap would improve the quality, yield, or target duration in the portfolio. 
c.  Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold. 
d.  Direction of mayor or city commission. 
(c)  Standards of care. 
(1)  Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy. 
Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived. 
(2)  Ethics and conflicts of interest. The mayor and city commissioners, department heads, and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf of the city. 
(3)  Delegation of authority. Authority to manage the investment program is granted to the finance director, hereinafter referred to as the "investment officer." Responsibility for the operation of the investment program is hereby delegated to the investment officer, who shall act in accordance with established written procedures and internal controls for the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy. Procedures should include references to: safekeeping, delivery vs. payment, investment accounting, repurchase agreements, wire transfer agreements, and collateral/depository agreements. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the investment officer. The investment officer shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. 
(d)  Safekeeping and custody. 
(1)  Authorized financial dealers and institutions. A list will be maintained of financial institutions authorized under F.S. ch. 280 to provide investment services. The city may purchase or sell securities through the broker/dealer of its city-authorized financial institution. In addition, a list also will be maintained of approved security broker/dealers selected by creditworthiness (e.g., a minimum capital requirement of $10,000,000.00 and at least five years of operations). These may include "primary" dealers or regional dealers that qualify under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule). Annual reports may be required from each broker/dealer to ensure its status and minimum capital requirement. 
(2)  Internal controls. The investment officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that assets of the city are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that (1) the cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management. 
(3)  Delivery vs. payment. All trades where applicable will be executed by delivery vs. payment (DVP) to ensure that securities are deposited in an eligible financial institution prior to release of funds. Securities will be held by a third-party custodian as evidenced by safekeeping receipts. 
(e)  Suitable and authorized investments. 
(1)  Investment types. The city's eligible investments shall be as follows: 
a.  The local government surplus trust fund or any intergovernmental investment pool authorized pursuant to the Florida Interlocal Cooperation Act as provided in F.S. § 163.01. 
b.  Securities and Exchange Commission registered money market funds with the highest credit quality rating from a nationally recognized rating agency (e.g., A-1, P-1, F-1, or D-1). 
c.  Interest-bearing time deposits or savings accounts in qualified public depositories as defined in F.S. 280.02. 
d.  Direct obligations of the United States Treasury. 
e.  Federal agencies and instrumentalities. 
f.  Repurchase agreements whose underlying purchased securities consist of the foregoing. 
g.  Securities of, or other interests in, any open-end or closed-end management-type investment company or investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. §§ 80a-1 et seq., as amended from time to time, provided that the portfolio of such investment company or investment trust is limited to obligations of the United States Government or any agency or instrumentality thereof and to repurchase agreements fully collateralized by such United States government obligations, and provided that such investment company or investment trust takes delivery of such collateral either directly or through an authorized custodian. 
h.  Government-backed derivatives; all other derivatives are prohibited. 
i.  Other investments that may be authorized by the city commission. 
(2)  Collateralization. Where allowed by Florida law, full collateralization will be required on non-negotiable certificates of deposit. 
(3)  Repurchase agreements. The investment policy shall require all approved institutions and dealers transacting repurchase agreements to execute and perform as stated in the master repurchase agreement. All repurchase agreements shall adhere to the requirements of the master repurchase agreement. 
(f)  Investment parameters. 
(1)  Diversification. The investments shall be diversified by: 
a.  Limiting investments to avoid over-concentration in securities from a specific issuer or business sector (excluding U.S. Treasury securities), 
b.  Limiting investment in securities that have higher credit risks, 
c.  Investing in securities with varying maturities, and 
d.  Continuously investing a portion of the portfolio in readily available funds such as local government investment pools, money market funds or overnight repurchase agreements to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in order to meet ongoing obligations. 
(2)  Maximum maturities. To the extent possible, the city shall attempt to match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the city will not directly invest in securities maturing more than five years from the date of purchase. The city shall adopt weighted average maturity limitations (which often range from 90 days to three years), consistent with the investment objectives. 
Reserve funds and other funds with longer-term investments horizons may be invested in securities exceeding five years if the maturity of such investments are made to coincide as nearly as practicable with the expected use of the funds. The intent to invest in securities with longer maturities shall be disclosed in writing to the city commission. 
Because of inherent difficulties in accurately forecasting cash flow requirements, a portion of the portfolio should be continuously invested in readily available funds such as local government investment pools, money market funds, or overnight repurchase agreements to ensure appropriate liquidity is maintained to meet ongoing obligations. 
(g)  Reporting. 
(1)  Methods. The investment officer shall prepare an investment report at least monthly. The report will be prepared in a manner that will document [that] the investment activities during the reporting period have conformed to the investment policy and will include references to alternative market rates of return. 
(2)  Performance standards. The investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with the parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio should obtain a market average rate of return during a market/economic environment of stable interest rates. 
(3)  Marking to market. The market value of the portfolio shall be calculated at least quarterly. 
(h)  Other matters. 
(1)  Bid requirements. The investment officer shall determine the approximate maturity date based on cash flow needs and market conditions, analyze and select one or more optimal types of investment, and competitively bid (investments in excess of $1,000,000.00) the security in question when feasible and appropriate. Except as otherwise required by law, the bid deemed to best meet the investment objectives must be selected. 
(2)  Continuing education. The investment officer responsible for making investment decisions must annually complete eight hours of continuing education in subjects or courses of study related to investment practices and products. 
(3)  Annual audit. The investment portfolio and procedures shall be reviewed and reported on by the independent auditors as part of their annual examination.

Sec. 2-164. - Gifts to city. 
Gifts to the City shall be accepted as follows: 
(1)  Department directors are authorized to accept gifts valued at less than $500.00. Evidence of such acceptance shall be provided to the finance director upon acceptance. 
(2)  City administration is authorized to accept gifts valued at $500.00 and less than $20,000.00. Evidence of such acceptance shall be provided to the finance director upon acceptance. 
(3)  Gifts valued at $20,000.00 or more shall be accepted by the city commission.

The treasurer, in accordance with the charter and rules and regulations established by resolution, shall purchase all materials, parts, supplies, equipment, and services required by any department or agency of the city government, in amounts less than $20,000.00 subject to approval of the mayor. 
(Code 1979, § 2-117; Ord. No. 2002-0816, § 2, 7-23-2002; Ord. No. 2006-860, § 2, 3-14-2006)  
Sec. 2-182. - Purchases of $20,000.00 or more. 
In the making of any purchase in the amount of $20,000.00 or more, the city commission shall advertise for formal sealed bids to be opened in public and to be awarded to the lowest responsible qualified bidder. Purchases in amounts less than $20,000.00 may be made without calling for formal sealed bids. The above requirements for advertising and receiving formal sealed bids may be waived by the city commission upon the unanimous vote of all of the city commissioners present at any given city commission meeting with the proviso that there must be at least four such city commissioners present and voting affirmatively. 
(Code 1979, § 2-118; Ord. No. 2002-0816, § 3, 7-23-2002; Ord. No. 2006-860, § 3, 3-14-2006)  
Sec. 2-183. - Contracts. 
(a)  Competitive bids shall attempt to be secured by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city of a notice to bidders before any purchase by contract or otherwise is made or before any contract is awarded for construction, alteration, repairs, maintenance or services, and the purchase shall be made or the contract awarded to the lowest qualified responsible bidder, or any and all bids may be rejected. Competitive bidding shall not be required in contracting for professional services. All contracts shall be approved by motion of the commission. All contractual obligations to be paid out of the appropriations of any one year must be retired within the ensuing three years, nor shall any such contract be valid unless made or approved by resolution. Leases in which the city is either the lessee or lessor may be for such periods as the commission by resolution approves, provided that all leases for a period of more than ten years shall provide for a system of determination at intervals of ten years of the amount of rental in the light of economic developments. The commission may by resolution enter into lease-purchase agreements, provided that the full outstanding amount under any such agreement at any given time shall be chargeable against the debt limit. The commission may by resolution require that successful bidders provide performance bonds, labor and material bonds or other appropriate types of bonds, and it shall provide in connection with any contract that a percentage of the contract amount be withheld for a period of 30 days beyond the date on which the city finally accepts the material, equipment, work or service as provided by the contractor. The commission may by resolution authorize participation by the city in joint procurement of materials, equipment, work or services with other public corporations within the state. The commission may by resolution establish contracts, requirements and procedures that extend this section but do not conflict with it. 
(b)  Should any city property be damaged and require immediate repair to prevent further damage and the city commission finds that the time required for advertising for competitive bids shall cause undue delay and further compound the damage to such city property, then the necessity for advertising for competitive bids shall be waived and the commission can award the bid on the basis of the receipt of three written bids for the reconstruction or repair.

The city commission may appoint a member of the Florida Bar as a code prosecutor on a permanent basis to attend all meetings or, in the alternative, to prosecute only such cases as the code inspector may request his participation and assistance. 
(Code 1979, § 7.5-12)  
Sec. 2-258. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the code inspector to initiate enforcement proceedings of the various codes; however, no member of the code enforcement board shall have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if a violation of the codes is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator and give him a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall notify the code enforcement board and request a hearing. The code enforcement board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of such hearing shall be hand delivered or mailed as provided in section 2-263 to such violator. At the option of the code enforcement board, notice may additionally be served by publication or posting as provided in section 2-263. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to the code enforcement board even if the violation has been corrected prior to the code enforcement board hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify an enforcement board and request a hearing. The code enforcement board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice pursuant to section 2-263. The case may be presented to the code enforcement board even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the code enforcement board retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his rights to this hearing and pay such costs as determined by the code enforcement board. 
(d)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the code enforcement board and request a hearing. 
(e)  If the owner of property which is subject to an enforcement proceeding before an enforcement board, special magistrate, or court transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(Code 1979, § 7.5-13; Ord. No. 751, § 3, 6-13-2000; Ord. No. 2005-851, § 2, 4-12-2005) 
State Law reference Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.06.  
Sec. 2-259. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  Upon request of the code inspector, or at such other times as may be necessary, the chairman of the code enforcement board may call a hearing of the code enforcement board. A hearing also may be called by written notice signed by at least three members of the code enforcement board. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings by the code enforcement board, and all hearings and proceedings shall be open to the public. The city commission shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required by the code enforcement board for the proper performance of its duties. 
(b)  Each case before the code enforcement board shall be presented by the code prosecutor. If the city commission prevails in prosecuting a case before the code enforcement board, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the code enforcement board and such costs may be included in the lien authorized under subsection 2-260(e). 
(c)  The code enforcement board shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The code enforcement board shall take testimony from the code inspector and alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. 
(d)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the code enforcement board shall issue findings of fact, based on evidence of record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted herein. The finding shall be by motion approved by a majority of those members present and voting, except that at least four members of the code enforcement board must vote in order for the action to be official. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed and, under the conditions specified in subsection 2-260(a), the cost of repairs may be included along with the fine if the order is not complied with by such date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the code enforcement board shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance. 
(Code 1979, §§ 7.5-14, 7.5-15, 7.5-17(b)(e)) 
State Law reference Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.07.  
Sec. 2-260. - Administrative fines; costs of repair; liens. 
(a)  The code enforcement board, upon notification by the code inspector that an order of the code enforcement board has not been complied with by the set time or, upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the code enforcement board for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in subsection 2-258(d) the code enforcement board shall notify the city commission, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city commission to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city commission for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this part, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, the code enforcement board finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation, and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. However, if the code enforcement board finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
(c)  In determining the amount of a fine, if any, the code enforcement board shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(d)  The code enforcement board may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
(e)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair costs may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this division, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this division runs in favor of the city commission, and the local governing body may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this division. Applications for satisfactions and releases of liens shall be reviewed and determined as provided in subsection (f) hereinafter. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the code enforcement board may authorize the local governing body attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this section may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Fla. Const. art. X § 4. 
(f)  All applications for lien reductions, satisfactions and releases shall be directed to the code enforcement board or the special magistrate, whichever certified the fine that resulted in the lien sought to be released. The code enforcement board or special magistrate shall consider the written request, the statements of the applicant or an authorized agent for the applicant, the recommendation of city administration, and any other information deemed relevant, and render a decision on the application. The decision of the code enforcement board or special magistrate concerning applications for satisfactions and releases of liens shall be final, subject to the following: 
(1)  The applicant shall have the right to appeal the decision to the city commission by filing an appeal with the city clerk within ten calendar days of the date of the meeting at which the code enforcement board or special magistrate rendered the decision on the application. 
(2)  The mayor or city administrator shall have the right to appeal the decision to the city commission by filing an appeal with the city clerk within ten calendar days of the date of the meeting at which the code enforcement board or special magistrate rendered the decision on the application. 
(3)  The city commission may review and consider a decision of the code enforcement board or special magistrate upon its own motion. Any such motion of the city commission shall be not later than the next regular city commission meeting or ten days after the date the board voted to approve the application, whichever is later. 
Should no appeal be timely filed, the decision of the code enforcement board or special magistrate shall be final the day after the next regular city commission meeting or ten days after the date the board voted to approve the application, whichever is later. The applicant shall make payment to the city within ten calendar days after the decision becomes final. Upon receipt of the required payment, the city administrator or his or her designee shall execute a satisfaction and release on behalf of the city. Should the applicant fail to make payment in a timely manner, the full amount of the lien shall be reinstated as due and payable to the city. 
(Code 1979, § 7.5-16; Ord. No. 751, § 4, 6-13-2000; Ord. No. 783, § 2, 6-26-2001; Ord. No. 2005-851, § 2, 4-12-2005) 
State Law reference Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.09.  
Sec. 2-261. - Duration of lien. 
No lien provided under this division shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The city commission shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. 
State Law reference Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.10.  
Sec. 2-262. - Appeals. 
An aggrieved party, including the city commission, may appeal a final administrative order of the code enforcement board to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the code enforcement board. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 
(Code 1979, § 7.5-17(a)) 
State Law reference Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.11.  
Sec. 2-263. - Notices. 
(a)  All notices required by this division shall be provided to the alleged violator by: 
(1)  Certified mail, return receipt requested, provided if such notice is sent under this paragraph to the owner of the property in question at the address listed in the tax collector's office for tax notices, and at any other address provided to the local government by such owner and is returned as unclaimed or refused, notice may be provided by posting as described in subsections (b)(2), and (b)(3), and by first class mail directed to the addresses furnished to the local government with a properly executed proof of mailing or affidavit confirming the first class mailing; 
(2)  Hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code inspector, or other person designated by the city commission; 
(3)  Leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice; or 
(4)  In the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. 
(b)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, at the option of the code enforcement board, notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(1)  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50 for legal and official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 50.051. 
(2)  In lieu of publication as described in subsection (b)(1) of this section, such notice may be posted at least ten days prior to the hearing or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at city hall. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(3)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt or attempts to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a) of this section. Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section, together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this part have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice.

(b)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land upon which the violation exists, or if the violator does not own the land, upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. It may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of the state, including levy against the personal property, but shall not be deemed otherwise to be a judgment of a court except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this division, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this division runs in favor of the city commission, and the local governing body may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this division. As authorized by law, the special magistrate may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on duly recorded liens that have remained unpaid. Property subject to a lien established by a special magistrate may be foreclosed by the city in a manner provided by state law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or, in the alternative, foreclosure proceedings may be instituted and prosecuted under the provisions of F.S. ch. 173, as currently enacted or as amended from time to time, or payment thereof enforced otherwise as authorized by law.

Sec. 2-272. - Supplementary provisions. 
The provisions and procedures contained in this chapter shall be in addition and supplemental to any other remedies now existing or subsequently provided for by law, regarding violations of municipal ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 737, § 3, 5-25-99)  
Sec. 2-273. - Supplemental enforcement of city ordinance. 
(a)  As used in this subchapter, code enforcement officer means any designated employee or agent of the city whose duty it is to enforce codes and ordinances enacted by the city. For the purpose of this subchapter, the term code enforcement officer shall be considered the equivalent of a "code inspector." 
(b)  The city may designate certain of its employees or agents as code enforcement officers. The training and qualifications of the employees or agents for such designation shall be determined by the city. Employees or agents who may be designated as code enforcement officers may include but are not limited to code inspectors, law enforcement officers, animal control officers, park rangers, or fire safety inspectors. Designation as a code enforcement officer does not provide the code enforcement officer with the power to arrest or subject the code enforcement officer to the provisions of F.S. §§ 943.085943.255, as amended. Nothing in this section amends, alters, or contravenes the provisions of any state administered retirement system established by general law. 
(c)  (1)  A code enforcement officer is authorized to issue a citation to a person when, based upon personal investigation, the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed a civil infraction in violation of a duly enacted code or ordinance, and the Broward County Court will hear charge. 
(2)  Prior to issuing a citation, a code enforcement officer shall provide notice to the person that the person has committed a violation of the code or ordinance and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the person must correct the violation. Such time period shall be no more than 30 days. If, upon personal investigation, a code enforcement officer finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the time period, a code enforcement officer may issue a citation to the person who has committed the violation. A code enforcement officer does not have to provide the person with a reasonable time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation and may immediately issue a citation if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible. 
(3)  A citation issued by a code enforcement officer shall be in a form prescribed by the city and shall contain: 
a.  The date and time of issuance. 
b.  The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued. 
c.  The date and time that the civil infraction was committed. 
d.  The facts constituting reasonable cause. 
e.  The number or section of the code or ordinance violated. 
f.  The name and authority of the code enforcement officer. 
g.  The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil penalty or to contest the citation. 
h.  The applicable civil penalty if the person elects to contest the citation. 
i.  The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest the citation. 
j.  A conspicuous statement that, if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time allowed or fails to appear in court to contest the citation, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to contest the citation and that in such case, judgment may be entered against the person for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty. 
(d)  After issuing a citation to an alleged violator, a code enforcement officer shall deposit the original citation and one copy of the citation with the Broward County Court. 
(e)  A violator issued a citation may contest such in county court. 
(f)  The city is authorized to enforce its codes and ordinances under the provisions of this section and by the enactment of this subchapter; 
(g)  A violation of a code or an ordinance is a civil infraction, and the maximum civil penalty for such shall not exceed $500.00. A civil penalty of less than the maximum civil penalty, set forth in the schedule of fines as provided in section 2-277, shall be paid to the city if the person who has committed the civil infraction does not contest the citation. 
(Ord. No. 751, § 6, 6-13-2000)  
Sec. 2-274. - County uniform code citation form. 
The city hereby adopts the Broward County Uniform Code Citation Form, attached to Ord. No. 751 and hereby adopted by reference, which sets forth the required data and information for each code enforcement officer of the city in connection with those requirements imposed by F.S. §162.21 (Part II) and known as "Supplemental County or Municipal Code or Ordinance Enforcement Procedures." 
(Ord. No. 751, § 7, 6-13-2000)  
Sec. 2-275. - Refusal to sign and accept citation. 
Any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by a code enforcement officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in F.S. 775.082 or 775.083. 
(Ord. No. 751, § 8, 6-13-2000)  
Sec. 2-276. - Provisions not applicable to building codes. 
The provisions of this section shall not apply to the enforcement pursuant to F.S. §§ 553.79 and 553.80 of building codes adopted pursuant to F.S. § 553.73, as they apply to construction, provided that a building permit is either not required or has been issued by the city. For the purposes of this division, "building codes" means only those codes adopted pursuant to F.S. § 553.73.

(2)  The determination of dangerousness by the hearing officer; or 
(3)  The conclusion of any appeal which is decided adversely to the owner. 
The owner shall be responsible for boarding fees, veterinary and other costs incurred by the city to maintain the dog during such impoundment unless the owner prevails at the conclusion of all legal proceedings. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the definition of " dangerous dog" as provided in this chapter, no dog may be classified dangerous if an injury or damage is sustained by a person who, at the time such injury or damage was sustained, was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon premises occupied by the owner or keeper of the dog, or, if lawfully on the property, was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog or its owner or a family member, or was committing or attempting to commit a crime. No dog may be classified dangerous if an injury or damage was sustained by an animal which at the time such injury or damage was sustained was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog. No dog may be classified dangerous if the dog was protecting or defending a human being within the immediate vicinity of the dog from an unjustified attack or assault. 
(f)  No person shall own or keep a dangerous dog without registering the dangerous dog with the city, and county pursuant to its ordinance and obtaining a dangerous dog license tag from the city and county pursuant to its ordinance within 14 calendar days of either the classification of dangerousness by the city; or, in the event an appeal of such classification is taken, the upholding of the classification by a hearing officer or a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding subsection 10-33(d), if a person decides to retain a dog classified as dangerous under this chapter, no other dogs or cats may be possessed and maintained on the property. No dog declared dangerous in another jurisdiction may be brought into the city. The procedures and requirements for registering the dangerous dog are as follows: 
(1)  The owner or keeper shall complete a dangerous dog registration form for the dog so classified and pay a one-time dangerous dog registration fee. 
(2)  A dangerous dog license tag shall be obtained at the fee set by the city. The dangerous dog license tag must be renewed annually. Failure to renew the dangerous dog license tag within 30 calendar days from the expiration of the previous tag will result in the issuance of a notice of violation and will subject the owner or keeper, and/or property owner to fines for non-compliance of this article. In the event a current dangerous dog license tag is lost, destroyed, or misplaced or otherwise missing, a replacement dangerous dog license tag must be obtained at the fee set by the city. 
(3)  Any additional fees and costs incurred by the owner as a result of registering the dog with the county as required herein shall be the responsibility of the owner. 
(4)  The owner or keeper shall display a sign on his or her premises warning that there is a dangerous dog on the premises. Said sign shall be visible and capable of being read from the public highway or street. 
(5)  Every owner of a dangerous dog shall, at all times that he or she owns the dog, maintain and provide a copy of an insurance policy to the city, specifically identifying the dog as covered by the policy, in the amount of no less than $100,000.00 issued by an insurer authorized to do business within the State of Florida, payable to any person injured in malice by the dangerous dog. Proof of financial responsibility shall be a condition precedent to the city approving the dog's registration. Financial responsibility shall be evidenced by filing with the police department a certificate of insurance from an insurance company authorized to do business in the state, valid for the one-year registration period. The city will be a certificate holder such that the city will be notified if the insurance coverages expire or terminate. 
As an alternative to maintaining the insurance otherwise required, proof of financial responsibility may also be evidenced by establishing a security escrow where the city holds securities (and stock or other powers appropriate to liquidate such securities) as an escrow agent. The value of the escrow of cash and securities shall at all times be maintained in the minimum amount of $100,000.00. In the event at any time the escrow is reduced as provided herein, it shall be a requirement that the value of the escrow be restored to its required minimum amount. In the event there is no violation of this article and there is no police report during the registration period for which the escrow is maintained that the dog bit or injured a human or animal, then the escrow shall be continued to be maintained. In the event of a police report that a dog for which the escrow is maintained bit a human or injured an animal, the city shall notify the victim (or parent, guardian, or owner of the victim if the victim is a minor or animal) and may use the cash or liquidate the securities and use the net proceeds thereof to reimburse the human (or parents or legal guardian of the human if the injured human is a minor) for any unpaid hospital or medical or rehabilitation treatment, or for any veterinary care or treatment provided to the animal. In the event of a violation of this article the city may use the amount in escrow to pay for any enforcement action the city may take, including but not limited to seeking an order requiring the dog involved to be placed by the city in a location outside the city and prohibited from the city at anytime in the future. This paragraph shall be supplemental to other methods of enforcing the city's laws that are available to the city. The registrant shall reimburse the city for any legal costs incurred by the city in establishing, monitoring, or performing the escrow. Finally, in the event of a cash escrow, the city may commingle the funds with other city funds, may keep any investment return thereon, will only be required to account for the principal thereof, and only the principal thereof will be used to determine the minimum amount of such escrow for maintenance purposes. 
(6)  The owner or keeper shall comply with section 10-34 of this chapter. A dangerous dog is required to wear the dangerous dog license tag. 
(7)  The owner or keeper shall, on or before the effective date of such registration for which application is being made, have an enclosure for the dangerous dog on the property where the dangerous dog will be kept or maintained. 
(8)  The owner or keeper shall at his or her own expense have the dangerous dog implanted with a city-approved electronic animal identification device (microchip) and provide the city with the microchip manufacturer and number. 
(g)  The owner or keeper of a dangerous dog shall: 
(1)  At all times ensure that the dog is securely confined indoors, or confined in an enclosure as defined herein. At any time that a dangerous dog is not so confined, the dog shall be muzzled in such a manner as to prevent it from biting or injuring any person or animal, and kept on a leash with the owner or custodian in attendance except for while the dog is being transported within the cab or passenger portion of any motor vehicle, provided said vehicle has a roof, and the dog cannot escape through an open window. 
(2)  Notify the city immediately if a dangerous dog is on the loose, is unconfined, has attacked another animal or has attacked a human being, or has died or has been sold or given away. If the dangerous dog has been sold or given away, the owner or keeper shall also provide to the city the name, address and telephone number of the new owner of the dangerous dog. 
(h)  Any dangerous dog without a valid dangerous dog license tag as required in this section, or which is not maintained on property with an enclosure, or which shall be outside of the dwelling of the owner or keeper, or outside of an enclosure except as provided in subsection (g)(1), shall be impounded by an officer, placed in quarantine, if necessary, for the proper length of time, or impounded and placed by the city in a location outside the city and prohibited from the city at anytime in the future, after the expiration of 14 calendar days from the date written notice is provided to the owner that such dog has been confiscated. Notice shall be effected by registered mail, certified hand delivery, or service of process in conformance with F.S. ch. 48. The 14-day time period shall allow the owner or keeper to request a hearing under section 10-36. In the event a dangerous dog is impounded, the owner shall pay a dangerous dog impound fee. 
(i)  If any dog previously classified as dangerous, when unprovoked, attacks and causes severe injury to or the death of a human being, or causes the death of an animal, while unprovoked and while off the owner's or keeper's property, an officer shall immediately confiscate and impound the dog and, after written notice to the owner and expiration of ten calendar days from the date the owner receives the notice, turn over such dangerous dog to an animal shelter. 
(j)  In the event that the owner or keeper of a dangerous dog is a minor, the parent or guardian of such minor shall be responsible for complying with the provisions of this section. No dangerous dog license shall be issued to any person under the age of 18 years.

(b)  The permit applicant and the owner of the real property located in or abutting a residentially-zoned district on which any construction activity will occur shall contain all construction debris, airborne and otherwise, on the subject construction site. For purposes of this section, demolition is included within the term, "construction." "Construction debris" shall mean any materials, supplies, equipment, garbage, solid waste, recyclables, earthen material, or particles derived from or arising out of the permitted construction activity. Construction site shall mean the real property on which construction is occurring. 
(c)  The building official may waive the inclusion of some of the screening and debris mitigation measures for construction projects affecting less than 25 percent of the structural square footage. Any such waiver by the building official shall be based on the nature of the project, the estimated time to complete the project, and the proximity of the construction site to neighboring residential properties and waterways. 
(d)  Temporary chain link perimeter site fencing and stormwater drain protection; temporary perimeter site fencing shall be required for construction and demolition sites in the city, pursuant to the following guidelines: 
(1)  The fence shall be six feet high, with approved wind screening material outside and attached to the fence to prevent dust intrusion upon adjacent properties 
(2)  The fence shall be installed and maintained at ground level on all sides of the construction site no later than ten days after the full or partial demolition of the existing structure or commencement of construction on a previously vacant lot. 
(3)  A permit is required for the proposed temporary site fencing and a survey identifying all easements on the property shall be submitted with the permit application. Property lines where the fence is to be installed shall be visually inspected for the presence of possible underground drainage pipes and those pipes shall be marked for protection. 
(4)  Approved wind screening material shall be black or green in color and contain no advertising. No signs shall be allowed to be hung on either the fence or screening material with the sole exception of the permit information sign which must be in full view on the street side of the fence and screening and must be hung on said fence and screening. The screening material shall cover the entire fence, and shall be maintained and kept in good repair. 
(5)  Those construction sites abutting a waterway must include the installation and maintenance of an approved silt fence to prevent any soil or construction debris from the construction site from entering the waterway. (Silt fence must be installed in accordance with the Florida Stormwater, Erosion and Sedimentation Control Inspector's Manual.)

Gates may open inward, slide open or open outward only if the gate when opened does not block any right-of-way or sidewalk. The gate shall be same height as the fence with an allowance of up to four inches on the bottom of the gate to allow for clearance from the ground to open. 
(7)  All construction materials, dumpsters and portable toilets shall be required to be placed within the fenced area at all times; and construction sites shall be secured at night and on weekends when no work is being performed on the structure. 
(8)  The area outside the fence, especially between the fence and the street pavement, must be kept clean, level, and free of any debris or construction material at all times. 
(9)  The temporary site fences must remain on the property until submission of the final survey to the city or until the building construction and landscaping are complete as determined by the zoning official. 
(10)  A waiver of the temporary site fencing may be granted by the zoning official, as follows: 
a.  If the property is intended to remain vacant, the property owner may request in writing a waiver from the site fencing requirement by stating that the property is intended to remain vacant; upon the granting of the waiver, the property shall be properly sodded and/or landscaped by the property owner within 30 days of demolition; 
b.  Where the property has or abuts to an existing six-foot high concrete wall, the zoning official may grant a waiver for the portion of the temporary site fencing that would otherwise be installed along the portion of the property where the wall is located; 
c.  On waterfront properties, an abutting property owner may request in writing the reduction of the screening material on a temporary site fence from six feet to four feet along those portions of the fence running at the seawall and 25 feet back from the seawall edge in an effort to minimize the loss of view towards the waterway. If the zoning official determines the screening material is obstructing the view of the canal from immediate adjacent lots, the screening material will be required to be lowered to four feet. 
d.  If a structure is to be occupied after partial demolition and during construction, the property owner may request and the zoning official may grant a waiver of all or a portion of the fencing requirement. 
(11)  Storm drain inlet protection must be placed over all stormwater catch basins in accordance with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) practices. Catch basins shall include those on the right of way of the affected property as well as those within 100 feet on adjacent properties. The inlets must be inspected and cleaned by the property owner or his or designee after each rainfall and maintained as needed. 
(12)  In the event of a hurricane, the screening material on the temporary site fences and stormwater drains shall be removed or lowered and secured as part of the "Special Hurricane Inspection" pursuant to Section 105.12 of the Florida Building Code as may be amended from time to time. 
(e)  When pouring or cutting concrete, stone, pavers, brick, or other similar material, a wet saw shall be used, wind screens shall be installed around saws on the work deck, and wind screens shall be installed on the end of concrete pump hoses. Cutting of roof tile on the roof of the structure is exempt from the wet saw requirement of this subsection. 
(f)  Streets and sidewalks adjacent to the construction site shall be kept clean of construction debris at all times. At the end of each workday, the construction site shall be free of litter. For purposes of this section, litter shall mean garbage, rubbish, trash, refuse, cans, bottles, boxes, containers, papers, tobacco products, tires, discarded building or construction material, discarded tools, discarded or inoperable machinery, and other similar items. 
(g)  A working telephone contact number for the construction site shall be provided in the building permit application to address construction screening and debris mitigation issues of city staff and the public as such issues may arise during the course of construction. 
(h)  City building inspectors and authorized city employees will visit the construction site, as necessary, to ensure that the concerns of neighboring and adjacent property owners regarding construction debris are being properly and timely addressed. 
(i)  Where there is a potential for impact to the stormwater, drainage, and sewerage systems of the city due to the construction, procedures shall be included for the protection against the intrusion of any construction debris into such system, except as otherwise permitted by applicable federal, state, and local law. Drains must remain operable and be routinely inspected by the permit applicant to assure compliance. 
(j)  The placement of portable toilets, dumpsters, and material storage shall not be permitted within the right-of-way of the construction site.

(Ord. No. 731, § 1, 2-9-99; Ord. No. 759, § 1, 9-11-2000; Ord. No. 2002-0817, § 2, 8-13-2002; Ord. No. 2002-825, § 6, 11-12-2002; Ord. No. 2012-0900, § 3, 5-22-2012)  
Sec. 14-81. - Definitions. 
(a)  Proper design concepts refers to architectural and landscape planning and to the analysis of the whole in terms of form and function as it relates to aesthetics and composition, color, materials and decorations. 
It includes scale in relationship to scale of adjacent buildings and landscape. It applies to inner character of the individual project. It applies in the same manner to alterations and advertising on the project (building). The fact that the area contains other unsightly buildings shall not constitute a valid reason not to comply with the requirements in this article. 
(b)  Proper design construction concerns design of all work in its details, the use of weather resistant material, etc. Applies also to advertising. Poorly designed work must always be discouraged. 
(c)  Appropriate to surroundings does not mean uniformity in style or subordination to existing buildings and landscape, but rather an orderly relationship with landscape and nature, other buildings and open areas. Again, scale and composition are important particularly as to adjacent properties. 
Surroundings are not only the existing buildings and landscape within a neighborhood but future surroundings must also be weighed. Advertising signs on buildings must be appropriate to the surroundings in the same way. 
(d)  Scale. The character of any architectural work is determined both in its internal space and in its external volume by the fundamental factor of scale, the relation between the dimensions of a building and the dimensions of a person. Every building is qualified by scale. 
(e)  Space. The experience of space, a characteristic of architecture, has its extension in the city, in the streets, squares, alleys and parks, in the playgrounds and in the gardens, wherever the built or natural environment has defined or limited a void and so has created an enclosed space. If, in the interior of a building, space is defined by six planes (floor, ceiling and four walls), this does not mean that a void enclosed by five planes instead of six - as, for example, a roofless courtyard or public square, cannot be regarded with equal validity as space. 
All urban space, wherever the view is screened off, whether by stone walls or rows of trees or embankments, presents the same features we find in architectural space. Every building creates two kinds of space: its internal space, completely defined by that building and the others around it and its external space. All objectsbridges, fountains, groups of trees, walls and, in particular, the facades of buildings are brought into play in the creation of urban space. 
(f)  Proportion means the relation of one portion to another, or to the whole, or of one thing to another, as respects to magnitude, quantity or degree and ratio. 
(g)  Garish means too bright or gaudy; showy, glaring; also cheaply brilliant or involving excessive ornamentation or advertisement. 
(Ord. No. 731, § 1, 2-9-99)  
Sec. 14-82. - Minimum design criteria. 
(a)  General criteria. 
(1)  Any plan for a proposed structure or project must be in conformity with good taste, good design, and in general, the structure or project must contribute to the image of the city, as a place of beauty, spaciousness, harmony, taste, fitness, broad vistas and high quality. 
(2)  The proposed structure or project must be, in its exterior design and appearance, of a quality such as not to cause the nature of the local environment or evolving environment to materially depreciate in appearance and value. 
(3)  Buildings or structures which are part of a present or future group or complex shall have a unity of character and design. The relationship of forms and the use, texture, and color of materials shall be such as to create a harmonious whole. When the area involved forms an integral part of, is immediately adjacent to, or otherwise clearly affects the future of any established section of the city, the design, scale and location of the site shall enhance rather than detract from the character, value and attractiveness of the surroundings. 
(4)  Buildings or structures located along strips of land or on single sites, and not part of a unified multi-building complex, shall strive to achieve visual harmony with the surroundings. If they are built in undeveloped areas, the two primary requirements shall be met: express proper design construction and show proper design concepts to the city. 
(5)  All facades visible to public or adjacent property shall be designed to create a harmonious whole. Materials shall express their function clearly and not appear as a material foreign to the rest of the building. 
(6)  The structure must be harmonious with the surroundings. To be harmonious it must not be inferred that buildings must look alike or be of the same style. Harmony can be achieved through the proper consideration of scale, proportions, site planning, landscaping, materials and color. 
(7)  Look-alike buildings are not permitted unless, in the opinion of the board, there is sufficient separation to preserve the aesthetic character of the present or evolving neighborhood. This is not to be construed to prohibit duplication of floor plans and exterior treatment in a planned development when, in the opinion of the board, the aesthetics of the development depend upon, or are enhanced by the look-alike buildings and their relationship to each other. 
(8)  Buildings which are of symbolic design or which have symbolic exterior facade or roof, colors, unless otherwise compatible with the criteria herein, will not be approved by this board. Symbols attached to buildings will not be allowed unless they are secondary in appearance to the building and landscape and are an aesthetic asset to the building project and neighborhood. 
(9)  Exterior lighting may be used to illuminate a building and its grounds for safety purposes, but in an aesthetic manner. Lighting is not to be used as a form of advertising in a manner that is not compatible to the neighborhood or in a manner that draws considerably more attention to the building or grounds at night than in the day. Lighting following the form of the building or part of the building will not be allowed if, in the opinion of the board, the overall effect will be garish or detrimental to the environment. All fixtures used in exterior lighting are to be selected for functional and aesthetic value. 
(10)  Building surfaces, walls, and roofs that are considered garish by the board will be denied approval. 
(11)  "Take out" or "pick up" windows or retail establishments shall not be located on a building facade that faces a public right-of -way. Provided however the board may, when in its judgment, such windows are designed in such a manner as to be an aesthetic asset to the building and neighborhood, permit the windows to face a public right-of-way. 
(12)  All external forms, attached or not to buildings, shall be in conformity to, and secondary to, the building. They shall be an asset to the aesthetics of the site and to the neighborhood. 
(13)  All telephones, vending machines, or any facility dispensing merchandise, or a service on private property, shall be confined to a space built into the building or buildings or enclosed in a separate structure compatible with the main building. 
(14)  No advertising will be allowed on any exposed amenity, trash containers or benches unless such bench advertising has been permitted by the city commission. 
(b)  Signs. 
The aesthetic quality of a building, or indeed of an entire neighborhood, is materially affected by achieving visual harmony of the signs on or about a structure as they relate to the architecture of the building or the adjacent surroundings. In addition to the limitations on signs imposed by chapter 42, article V., "Signs" of this Code, there are certain aesthetic considerations which must be met. 
(1)  The scale of the sign must be consistent with the scale of the building on which it is placed or painted. 
(2)  The overall effect of the configuration or coloring of the sign shall be one of proper design concept and shall be aesthetically pleasing. The colors shall not conflict with other signs already on the building or in the immediate vicinity. 
(3)  The intent of signage is to represent the identification of the primary business purposes conducted on the site. Signage shall be designed so as to represent an identification of services or products. 
(c)  Exterior space. The scale of exterior space is to be relative to its neighborhood adjacent properties, buildings, access (roads and pedestrian routes) and its activity. Building facades enclosing a space must be harmonious. Where, because of their use or age, like facades are not possible, consideration should be given to unifying the walls of the space by the application of landscaping, or manmade objects of like design, at modular spacing. The floor of a space is of primary importance. Its materials, texture and color, contour and shadow on it are to be considered, not only in relation to the space, but to its setting. Careful consideration shall be given to the preservation of natural vistas, which open into open areas. 
(d)  Landscaping. Emphasis shall be placed upon landscaping as a means of achieving beauty in the community. It will be required on all projects; in some projects and areas it will be the primary tool available. The city contains subtropical vegetation and characteristics, with diverse areas of native plants and terrain to serve as guides and models for all landscaping plans. 
Landscape design and planning shall be integrated with the overall area design concept and not be considered merely as an afterthought. Toward this end, proposed landscaping schemes will be evaluated as to their relationship to the existing natural landscape, developed and other proposed landscape, including those on adjacent properties and street right-of-way and the building or buildings existing and proposed. 
(1)  The existing natural landscape shall be preserved whenever possible. As an example of this, in an area containing a stand of trees, the developer shall preserve as many of these trees as possible and further landscape in a complementary manner, rather than destroy the existing trees and replant with a type of vegetation foreign to the immediate natural environment. Existing vegetation must be indicated on the landscape plan. Protection of the existing vegetation during construction is required. 
(2)  Landscaping includes not only trees and planting but paving, benches, fountains, exterior lighting fixtures, fences, and any other item of exterior furniture. All items of the landscape are to be selected not only for their functional value but for their aesthetic value, and must complement the whole. 
(3)  One of the uses of landscaping will be to screen, which means the masking out or concealment of any visually objectionable area. The achievement of this is left to the designer, whether by walls, fences, mounds of earth, or vegetation. It must be complementary to the whole as outlined above. Screening shall be employed to mask from the public view of adjacent properties such service areas as trash and garbage areas, outside equipment of unaesthetic character, and accessory buildings or areas not enhancing or in keeping with the aesthetics of the project or neighborhood. Screening of air conditioning units and other mechanical equipment shall be accomplished in a manner that does not interfere with the proper operation and/or maintenance of such equipment. 
(4)  Landscaping shall be designed in such a manner as to impart its aesthetic character when viewed from any area accessible to the public or from adjacent properties. This is to include view from high-rise structures and bridges. 
(5)  Landscaping of existing properties. Whenever the exterior of an existing structure is structurally altered in any manner, landscaping shall be upgraded, unless it already meets current requirements, or unless in the opinion of the board such upgrading is impractical or would result in undue hardship. The developer has the burden of proving that any requirement imposes such an undue hardship. In this case, the board reserves the right to waive such portions of the criteria as it deems advisable. 
(e)  Parking lots and vehicular use areas. 
(1)  Parking lots and other vehicular use areas are to be designed as an aesthetic asset to a neighborhood and to the building, group of buildings, or facility they serve. A parking lot is to be considered an outside space, a transitional space which is experience between the access (such as roads) and the building, group of buildings or other outside spaces, which it serves. The parking lot, because it is viewed from above as well as at eye level, should be designed accordingly. 
(2)  Parking lots, vehicular use areas, and their parked vehicles are to be effectively screened from the public view and from adjacent property and in a manner that is attractive and compatible with safety, the neighborhood, and facilities served. 
(3)  The atmosphere within the parking lot and vehicular use area is to be park-like rather than the harsh hardstand of paving. Trees are of primary importance in the landscape. They are not to be minimized in either height or quantity. The tree imparts, especially in a relatively flat area, a sense of three-dimensional space. It casts shadows that reduce the monotony of the expanse of paving and creates a refuge from the tropical sun. Signs designating entrances, exits, and regulations, are to be of a tasteful design and subject to review by the board. The pavement is to be more than wall to wall asphalt. It is recommended that pavement be varied in texture or color designating lanes for automobile traffic, pedestrian walks and parking spaces. Bright colored pavement is to be used only with restraint. In order to create a pleasant atmosphere it is recommended that consideration be given to sculpture, fountains, gardens, pools and benches. Design emphasis is to be given to the entrances and exits to the lot. Trash, refuse and unaesthetic storage and mechanical equipment should be screened from the parking lot. 
(4)  Lighting is to be designed not only from the standpoint of safety and resistance to vandalism, but for the visual effect. It should avoid any annoyance to the neighbors from brightness or glare. It should not impart a prison-like atmosphere. Low lights of a modest scale can be used along with feature lighting emphasizing plants, trees, barriers, entrances and exits. The fixtures are to be selected not only for their functional value but for their aesthetic qualities. They are to be considered furniture of the parking lot visible both day and night. 
(5)  Landscaping of parking lots and vehicular areas shall comply with all city codes. 
(f)  Existing code provisions. It is intended that subsections (b) Signs, (d) Landscape or (e) Parking lots and vehicular use areas shall not replace any existing code provisions but merely be read in conjunction with any such code provisions and address the aesthetics of the situation. 
(g)  Areas of particular note. 
(1)  Intracoastal waterway and interior canals. The intracoastal waterway, a natural north-south thoroughfare, has two main inherent attributes. One is the natural vistas from parks, bridges and other points of public access. The second is the imparting of an aesthetic experience together with an insight into the basic character of the city when traversing the waterway, with its winding and varied width course. The same applies to the various interior canals throughout the city. Therefore, buildings within view of the waterway or canals must present to such waterway or canals their facade of greatest or equal to greatest importance. All accessory buildings and facilities shall be screened from the public view or designed to the standards of the adjacent buildings. 
(2)  U.S. Highway No. 1. U.S. Highway No. 1 is presently our major north-south artery of interurban traffic. Even though U.S. Highway No. 1 has a diversity of zoning and uses, and consequently a variety of form, all projects shall meet criteria of the general requirements. The importance of site planning and landscaping is stressed on this road in order to reduce the chances of the undesirable features of over-advertising and confusion, and to develop an identity to the natural landscape and desired character of the city. 
(3)  Lighthouse Drive. Lighthouse Drive is considered to be a main route of north-south traverse through the city. It acts as a connector entrance and exit, and views from it impart an insight into the atmosphere of the city. It is, therefore, felt that areas seen from this route, even though of a varied use from residential to commercial must be developed in a manner that seeks to reflect the herein tone sought to be established for the community. Buildings shall be designed with major considerations given to forms, facades, roof coverings and landscaping. The facade of greatest importance or one of an aesthetic equal shall be presented to these routes. General requirements covering structure, landscaping and exterior spaces shall also pertain. Individual site landscaping is to be encouraged, but it is necessary that it be relative to future city plans for public right-of-way. 
(4)  Sample Road. This is the city main east/west artery. Development or renovations along this route should have a pleasing form. Although there are some older existing buildings, this fact should not deter the board from insisting on current compliance for all new construction. This will stimulate new pride in ownership and future development. 
(5)  N.E. 49th Street, N.E. 39th Street, N.E. 27th Street and N.E. 24th Street. These streets are, as is Sample Road, main east/west arteries. The same observations can be made of the development on these streets as of Sample Road, which is that construction shall be made to conform to the criteria of this article.

Sec. 14-82.5. - Appeals. 
(a)  Should any application to the board be denied, the applicant shall have the right to appeal to the city commission, who shall sit as a board of appeals to consider such appeal based upon the record established before the board. All such appeals to the city commission shall be filed within ten calendar days after the board votes on the application by filing a letter of appeal with the city clerk. 
(b)  Should any application to the board be approved, the mayor or administrative assistant of the city, or any other resident of the city, shall have the right to appeal the approval of the application to the city commission, who shall sit as a board of appeals to consider such appeal based upon the record established before the board. All such appeals to the city commission shall be filed within ten calendar days after the board votes on the application by filing a letter with the city clerk. 
(c)  Should any application to the board be approved, the city commission shall have the right, power and authority to, upon its own motion, review the decision of the board, and upon such motion the city commission shall set a date and time at which it shall sit as the board of appeal to consider the approval of the application based upon the record established before the board. Any such motion of the city commission shall be not later than the next regular city commission meeting or ten days after the date the board voted to approve the application, whichever is later. 
(d)  In the event of an appeal under subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the city commission shall have the power to confirm the action of the board, to reject, to overrule or to change any action of the board upon the application. 
(e)  All appeals to the city commission, except appeals initiated by the mayor, the administrative assistant or by motion of the city commission, to review action of the board shall require a filing fee as set forth in the fee schedule as established by the city commission by resolution, and check therefor must be filed with the appeal papers when such appeal papers are filed with the city clerk. 
(Ord. No. 759, § 1, 9-11-2000)  
Sec. 14-83. - Violations and penalties. 
(a)  The city code enforcement board and special magistrate shall have the jurisdiction and authority to hear and decide alleged violations of chapter 14, article III, of this Code, which alleged violations shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of chapter 2, article VII, of this Code. In addition, the city shall have the right to enforce the provisions of this article through supplemental enforcement procedures as provided by F.S. ch. 162, part II, as well as appropriate legal action as determined necessary by the city to effectuate compliance with this article. 
(b)  In the event improvements for which review by this board is required is commenced or completed prior to approval by the board, the property owner shall be in violation of this article and subject to enforcement as provided herein, including the levying of appropriate fines, and the board shall be under no obligation to approve the improvement. In the event the board does not approve the improvement as installed, the improvement shall be modified consistent with the approval of the board, or removed from the property, within the period of time provided by the board to remedy the property, and the failure to do so shall be a violation of an order of the board, separate and distinct from the violation for commencing or completing improvements prior to review by the board, and subject the property owner to the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) herein.

(a)  The purpose of this division is to establish fees for occupation of the city's rights-of-way for telecommunications facilities of telecommunications companies not otherwise paying a fee to the city or not otherwise having an agreement with the city for occupation of the city's rights-of-way. Any telecommunications company paying fees or having an existing agreement with the city for the occupation of the city's rights-of-way for telecommunications facilities as of the effective date of this division shall continue to pay fees to the city as the company has been paying them or pursuant to the existing agreement.

(d)  The fees imposed pursuant to this division are a fee and not a tax as specified in F.S. § 337.401; consequently, (1) the payments to be made pursuant to this division shall not be deemed to be in the nature of a tax; (2) such payments shall be in addition to any and all taxes of a general applicability; and (3) the fee specified herein is consideration for occupation of the city's rights-of-way, including all public easements, for the purpose of erecting, constructing and maintaining telecommunications systems. 
(Ord. No. 777, §§ 25, 1-23-2001)  
Sec. 18-52. - Fee for telecommunications company occupation of rights-of-way. 
(a)  (1)  Any telecommunications company providing local telephone service, as defined in F.S. § 203.012(3), in the city and that is occupying municipal streets or rights-of-way within the corporate limits of the city with poles, wires or other fixtures shall pay to the city a fee in the amount of one percent of the gross receipts on recurring local service revenues for services provided within the corporate limits of the city by such telecommunications company. Included within the fee are all taxes, licenses, fees, in-kind contributions accepted pursuant to F.S. § 337.401, and other impositions except ad valorem taxes and amounts for assessments for special benefits, such as sidewalks, street pavings, and similar improvements, and local business taxes levied or imposed by the city upon the telecommunications company. 
(2)  In the event that a telecommunications company which provides telecommunications services defined as toll services in F.S. § 203.012 (7), occupies the city's rights-of-way, the telecommunications company shall pay to the city annually $500.00 per linear mile, which amount is prorated for any portion thereof, for any cable, fiber optic, or other pathway that makes physical use of the city's rights-of-way. Such annual fee shall be prorated to reflect the expiration date of this division and shall be payable annually, in advance. If a telecommunications company that is required to pay a fee pursuant to this subsection (a)(2) increases the amount of its facilities occupying the city's rights-of-way after such advance payment has been made, but prior to the expiration date of this division, the fees due for the additional facilities shall be prorated and paid in full at the time the facilities are installed in the city's rights-of-way. 
The fee or other consideration imposed pursuant to this subsection (2) shall not apply in any manner to any telecommunications company which provides local telephone service as defined in F.S. § 203.012(3), for any services provided by such telecommunications company. 
(b)  The fees provided for in subsection (a)(1) shall be paid by the telecommunications company to the city in quarterly installment(s). The installment payment(s) shall be based upon such gross receipts on recurring local service revenues for the immediately preceding installment period or portion thereof after the effective date of this division, and shall be made within 30 calendar days following the end of the period. Past due payments or underpayments shall bear interest accrued from the last day of the quarter for which the payment was due at the rate of 18 percent per annum from the first day after the payment period until paid to the city. The company shall reimburse the city for any actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with collecting any sums it is required to remit to the city. Payments shall include a statement as to how the fee amount was determined and the statement shall be certified by the telecommunications company's chief financial officer or other duly authorized representative of the company.

Sec. 18-53. - Audit of telecommunications company records. 
If the city wishes to verify the payments due to the city under this section, the telecommunications company shall permit the city or a designated representative of the city, upon reasonable advance written notice, and during normal business hours at the location of the telecommunications company where such records are maintained in the city, at another location satisfactory to the city, or elsewhere pursuant to (1) or (2) below, to review or audit the telecommunications company's billing and payment records kept in the ordinary course of business upon which the payments were based. If a telecommunications company's records are not maintained in the city, the telecommunications company shall either: 
(1)  Pay all reasonable expenses, including travel, following the provisions of F.S. § 112.061 (6), (7) and (8), to the city for the city to have a review or audit performed; or 
(2)  Provide the city with access to copies of the telecommunications company's records in the city or within 55 miles of the city or by an electronic method satisfactory to the city. 
However, without the specific written consent of a telecommunications company's audit representative, no company records may be duplicated or taken from the telecommunications company's premises, and the city shall maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed in these records, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and use the information solely for the purposes of verifying payments by the telecommunications company. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for sums due and payable under this division unless the city agrees in writing. In the event that the city, pursuant to final audit findings, determines that there exists a difference between the amount due to the city and the amount paid to the city, indicating an underpayment to the city, in excess of five percent of the amount due, such telecommunications company shall pay all reasonable costs, fees and expenses of the audit.

This definition of "pass-through provider" is intended to include any person that places or maintains a communications system or communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, but does not provide communications services to an end user within the corporate limits of the city. A utility defined in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 224, is not a pass-through provider. 
Person shall include any individual, children, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include city to the extent the city acts as a communications services provider. 
Personal wireless services means commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless services, and common carrier wireless exchange access services, and shall include "wireless service" as defined in F.S. § 365.172, as well as "personal wireless services" defined in 47 USC § 332(c)(7)(C)(i), as they may be amended. 
Personal wireless service facilities means facilities for the provision of personal wireless services, and, for the purposes of this section, it shall include all of those "wireless communications facilities" as defined in F.S. § 365.172, as it may be amended, that are not also telecommunications towers as defined in this section. A power, light or other utility pole used exclusively as such prior to attachment of a personal wireless service facility shall not be considered a personal wireless service facility because of such attachment. 
Place or maintain or placement or maintenance or placing or maintaining shall mean to erect, construct, install, maintain, grade, excavate, place, repair, extend, replace, expand, remove, occupy, locate or relocate. A communications services provider that owns or exercises physical control over communications facilities in public rights-of-way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the facilities. A party providing service only through resale or only through use of a third party's unbundled network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities through which such service is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the public rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
Public rights-of-way shall mean a public right-of-way, public utility easement, public highway, street, lane, bridge, sidewalk, road, waterway, tunnel, alley, or similar property for which the city is the authority that has jurisdiction and control and may lawfully grant access to such property pursuant to applicable law, and includes the surface, the air space over the surface and the area below the surface to the extent the city holds a property interest therein. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include any real or personal city property except as described above and shall not include city buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or other structures or improvements, regardless of whether they are situated in the public rights-of-way. No reference herein, or in any permit, to public rights-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the city that its interest or other right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a registrant shall be deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the city and as the city may have the undisputed right and power to give. 
Registrant shall mean a communications services provider or other person that has registered with the city in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
Registration or register shall mean the process described in this article whereby a communications services provider provides certain information to the city. 
Stealth facility means any telecommunications facility which is designed to blend into the surrounding environment. Examples of stealth facilities include architecturally screened roof-mounted antennas, antennas integrated into architectural elements, poles in the rights-of-way that are designed to look like light poles, and wireless facilities designed to look like light poles, power poles or trees.

A communications services provider with an existing communications facility in the public rights-of-way of the city as of the effective date of this article shall comply with this article within 60 days from the effective date of this article, including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation hereof. 
(b)  A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider, communications facility provider, or pass-through provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city's or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider, communications facility provider, or pass-through provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(c)  Each communications services provider, communications facility provider, or pass-through provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city which shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name of the applicant; 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3)  For registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001, the applicant shall state whether it provides local service or toll service or both;

The city shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. 
(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Registration shall not in itself establish any right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city, but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city's ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1st of even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection 20-35(c), except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection 20-35 (c)(3), a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider, communications facility provider, or pass-through provider has complied with the registration requirements of this section. 
(h)  In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations and this article, a permit shall be required of a communications services provider, communications facility provider, or pass-through provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition precedent to obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall continue to apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(i)  A registrant that places or maintains communications facilities in the public rights-of-way and that pays communications services taxes shall not be required to pay a permit fee since the city has elected to collect the communications services tax pursuant to F.S. ch. 202, as may be amended from time to time. Pass-through providers shall pay a fee pursuant to applicable resolution or city code provision, and F.S. § 337.401(5), as may be amended from time to time. A pass-through provider that places or maintains a communications facility in the city's roads or rights-of-way shall pay the city an annual amount not to exceed $500.00 per linear mile or portion thereof. The city's roads or rights-of-way do not include roads or rights-of-way that extend in or through the municipality but are state, county, or another authority's roads or rights-of-way.

(Ord. No. 784, § 7, 7-10-2001)  
Sec. 20-38. - Personal wireless service facilities in the public right-of-way. 
(a)  Minimum standards. Personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way must meet the following minimum standards: 
(1)  Required approvals. No application for placement of personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be permitted without approval of the building department, the public works department, and the city's zoning administrator. If the personal wireless service facility is not co-located, and is located in a residential zoning district, in order to be permitted, the application must be approved by the planning and zoning board, as a conditional use in accordance with section 42-360, with written notice provided to adjacent property owners within 400 feet of the proposed location. The planning and zoning board shall take into consideration the concerns of adjacent property owners with respect to adverse impacts on the neighborhood aesthetics and maintenance requirements. 
(2)  General application requirements. In addition to the items listed on this section, an application package shall include a drawing or drawings depicting all the proposed improvements but not limited to: the proposed facility, colors to be used, height, location of all equipment, landscape buffers and materials, location of any existing vegetation and any proposed easements. 
(3)  Site plan review in lieu of underground placement. Because an antenna must be placed above-ground in order to transmit and receive signals, except in the case of co-location, an applicant proposing placement of an antenna in the public rights-of-way shall submit a site plan for review and approval. No building permit shall be issued by the building department and no engineering permit shall be issued by the public works department prior to the approval of a site plan where required pursuant to this subsection. 
(4)  Completeness review; time limitation. The city shall grant or deny a properly completed application for personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way within 90 business days or, as required by federal and state law, after the date the application is determined to be complete. An application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is received by the building department. The building department shall notify the applicant within 20 business days after the date the application is initially submitted or additional information resubmitted, whether the application is properly completed in compliance with the city's requirements. If the application is not completed in compliance with the city's requirements, the building department shall so notify the applicant in writing indicating with specificity any deficiencies which, if cured, make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of information to cure the stated deficiencies, the building department shall notify the applicant, in writing, no later than 20 business days after the additional information is submitted, of any remaining deficiencies that must be cured. If a specified deficiency is not properly cured when the applicant resubmits its application to comply with the notice of deficiencies, the building department may continue to request the information until such time as the specified deficiency is cured, or may establish a reasonable time frame within which the required information to cure the application deficiency is to be provided. If the curative information is not provided within such time frame, the application will be considered withdrawn or closed. 
(5)  Co-location or use of stealth facilities. An antenna in the public rights-of-way, shall to the extent possible, be collocated on an existing power, light or other utility pole. The cost to the applicant to co-locate the facilities on an existing power, light, or other utility pole shall not be a basis for the applicant to determine that the co-location is not possible. If the co-location is proposed to be on a utility pole owned by the city, the applicant shall be responsible for any costs associated with such co-location as determined by the city engineer. When co-location of an antenna is not possible, a free standing stealth facility not exceeding 30 feet tall shall be utilized; however, a non-stealth type facility may be utilized if the applicant provides a certified statement from a professional engineer, subject to review and approval by the city engineer, stating that due to technological or other physical requirements, the facility to be installed cannot be a stealth type facility. 
(6)  Statement. A certified statement or statements from a professional engineer shall be submitted certifying that the construction of personal wireless service facilities proposed to be located in the public rights-of-way will comply with applicable standards as set forth in the Florida Building Code, latest edition, the State of Florida Department of Transportation, Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways, and electrical codes; and describing the proposed personal wireless service facilities' capacity to permit multiple users, including an example of the number and type of antennas or other attachments that can be accommodated on support structures. No personal wireless service facility which exceeds its support structure's loading capacity, which causes any pole or structure to exceed its loading capacity or which does not conform to applicable electrical codes shall be permitted in the public rights-of-way. 
(7)  Dimensional limits for cabinets, boxes and vaults. No permit or order shall be granted authorizing the placement, construction or modification in the public rights-of-way of a personal wireless service facility cabinet, box or vault having a total volume exceeding 24 cubic feet, unless the applicant provides a certified statement by a professional engineer, subject to review and approval of the city engineer, explaining the need for the greater proposed dimensions and certifying that current technology provides no alternative consistent with the dimensional requirements of this subsection. 
(b)  Height, setbacks and related location requirements. 
(1)  The height of a new pole in the public rights-of-way to which an antenna is attached shall not exceed 30 feet. Height shall be measured from the crown of the road of the nearest public street. 
(2)  Except as otherwise provided herein, personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall conform to the standards and requirements set forth in the State of Florida Department of Transportation Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways. 
(3)  No antenna attached to a free-standing pole in the public rights-of-way, other than as a co-location with an existing power, light or other utility pole, or unless installed as a stealth facility, shall be permitted within 50 feet of any principal residential structure. 
(4)  A box or cabinet housing the equipment connected to an antenna attached to a freestanding pole in the public rights-of-way shall be placed on the ground instead of attached to the pole supporting the antenna, and shall be screened from view. Any deviation from the requirement that the box or cabinet housing the equipment connected to an antenna be placed on the ground, not to exceed six inches above the ground, shall be subject to the approval of the planning and zoning board. 
(c)  Antennas. 
(1)  Each application, other than for co-location, shall contain a rendering or photograph of the proposed antenna which depicts its aesthetic features including, but not limited to, the use of colors and screening devices. The city's zoning administrator may require, to the extent possible, that aesthetic features including but not limited to, the use of colors and screening devices, be used so that antennas blend into the surrounding environment. 
(2)  No signals, lights, or illumination shall be permitted on an antenna or, except in the case of a light pole or a stealth facility designed to emulate a light pole, on a pole to which such antenna is attached, unless required by applicable state or federal laws or rules. 
(3)  Antennas shall be mounted at a height and location that will not interfere with use of the public rights-of-way. 
(4)  No exterior antenna in the public rights-of-way shall exceed the height of the pole to which it is attached unless it is attached as a co-location to an existing power, light or other utility pole or on a pole designed to emulate a light pole. 
(5)  No antenna shall be mounted more than four inches from the pole to which it is attached unless it is attached as a co-location to an existing power, light or other utility pole. 
(6)  Exterior looping of excess cable length installed on any personal wireless service facility located in the public right-of-way is prohibited. 
(7)  Antenna dimensions. Antenna dimensions shall be approved by the city's zoning administrator as required by existing technology. The city's zoning administrator may require a statement certifying the need for the required dimensions. 
(8)  Distance between antenna locations/number of antenna locations within a specified area. To minimize the adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of antennas and associated above-ground personal wireless service facilities, no antenna site in the public rights-of-way shall be located within 400 feet of any other such antenna site or telecommunications tower. Furthermore, no more than 13 antenna sites may be located within an area of one square mile. This subsection (c)(8) shall not apply to any antenna collocated on an existing power, light or other utility pole within the public rights-of-way. A signed and sealed special purpose survey from a Florida certified surveyor shall be provided showing compliance with these distance separation requirements. 
(d)  Co-locations. For the purposes of this section, "co-location" means the mounting or installation of an antenna on an existing power, light or other utility pole for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes. In any co-location, the existing power, light or other utility pole may be modified or replaced to accommodate the new attachment, provided however that the modified or replacement pole complies with the height, setback and related location requirements of sections 20-38(b)(1), (2), and (4), unless such requirements are waived pursuant to section 20-38(1). For the purposes of section 20-38, an existing power, light or other utility pole modified or replaced to accommodate a new attachment shall continue to be considered an existing pole after replacement or modification. 
(e)  Approval required from governmental agencies. 
(1)  Aircraft hazard. Prior to the issuance of a building permit by the building department, the applicant shall provide evidence showing compliance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations and the Federal Communications Commission emissions standards as applicable. A written approval or a statement of no objection shall be provided. 
(2)  Other agencies. Each application may be required to include written approval or a statement of no objection from other federal or state agencies that may regulate communications or personal wireless service facilities siting, design, and construction. 
(f)  Buffering. 
(1)  Except in the case of an application for a co-location, as a condition of approval the city's zoning administrator may require the use of a fence as a buffer. Fencing colors and material shall be nature blending. 
(2)  Except in the case of an application for a co-location, as a condition of approval the city's zoning administrator may require the use of landscaping as a buffer, which landscaping is consistent with the landscaping otherwise located in the public rights-of-way and the requirements of section 42-433 of the Land Development Code. Additional landscaping may be required if deemed necessary to buffer adjacent properties and or equipment. The city's zoning administrator may require landscaping in excess of the requirements of the city code to enhance compatibility with adjacent residential and nonresidential land uses. 
(3)  All buffering required in connection with the use of personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be maintained by the owner of such facilities at its own cost. 
(g)  Equipment.

If the city does not use the 30-day negotiation period provided in subsection (b) above, the parties may mutually agree to extend the 60-day application review period. The city shall grant or deny the application at the end of the extended period. A permit issued pursuant to an approved collocation application shall remain effective for one year unless extended by the city. 
(5)  Written approval or denial. The city shall notify the applicant of approval or denial by electronic mail. The city shall approve a complete application unless it does not meet the applicable codes.

(9)  Collocation on city utility poles. 
a.  The fee to collocate a small wireless facility on a city utility pole shall be $150.00 per pole annually. 
b.  The city may reserve space on a city utility pole for future public safety uses. However, a reservation of space may not preclude collocation of a small wireless facility. If replacement of the city utility pole is necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small wireless facility and the future public safety use, the pole replacement is subject to make-ready provisions and the replaced pole shall accommodate the future public safety use. 
c.  For a city utility pole that supports an aerial facility used to provide communication services or electrical service, the city and applicant shall comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 U.S.C. § 224 and implementing regulations. The good faith estimate of the city for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation must include pole replacement, if necessary. 
d.  For a city utility pole that does not support an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the city shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation, including necessary pole replacement, within 60 days after receipt of a complete application. Make-ready work, including ay pole replacement, shall be completed within 60 days after written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the applicant. Alternatively, the city may require the applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless facility to provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant's expense of the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. The city may not condition or restrict the manner in which the applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make-ready work subject to usual construction restoration for work in the rights-of-way. 
e.  The make-ready work specified in subsections c. and d. above shall be subject to the city's usual construction restoration standards for work in the right-of-way. The replaced or altered city utility pole shall remain the property of the city. 
(10)  Design standards. The city's design standards set forth in the applicable codes may be waived by the city commission upon a showing that the design standards are not reasonably compatible for the particular location of a small wireless facility or that the design standards impose an excessive expense for a small wireless facility. The waiver shall be granted or denied within 45 days after the date of the request. 
(11)  Permitting. An applicant for installation of a small wireless facility shall obtain a right-of-way permit from the city for any work that involves excavation, closure of a sidewalk, or closure of a vehicular lane. 
(12)  Airport airspace. A structure granted a permit and installed pursuant to this section shall comply with F.S. ch. 333, and federal regulations pertaining to airport airspace protections. 
(13)  No authorization to collocate on city utility poles; no application to homeowner's association restricted pole. This section does not authorize a person to collocate small wireless facilities or micro wireless facilities on a city utility pole, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law, or erect a wireless support structure in a location subject to covenants, conditions, restrictions, articles of incorporation, and bylaws of a homeowners' association.

ARTICLE IV. - FIRE PROTECTION SPECIAL ASSESSMENT 
 
Sec. 34-81. - Intent. 
It is the intent of the city to provide a methodology for the fair and reasonable levy and collection of a citywide special assessment to fund the provision of fire protection services by the city. The city intends to utilize the uniform method for the levy and collection of special assessments, as provided in F.S. §§ 197.3632 and 197.3635, as those provisions set forth a fair and reasonable procedure to levy and collect special assessments that ensures proper notice and adequate due process to affected parties, and provides for the cooperation between the city and other governmental entities toward the collection and use of data, providing notice to affected parties, and ensuring the collection of proceeds for use by the city. It is not the intent of the city to create any additional due process rights other than those set forth in F.S §§ 197.3632 and 197.3635. To the extent any provisions in this article conflict with those statutory provisions, the aforementioned statutes shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 6-9-1998)  
Sec. 34-82. - Findings of special benefit. 
The city specifically finds that the provision of fire protection service by the city provides the requisite special benefit to real property within the city to justify the funding of fire protection services through a special assessment, as the provision of fire protection services possesses a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of real property by: 
(1)  Protecting the value of improvements and structures upon real property; 
(2)  Lowering the cost of insurance upon real property, including but not limited to fire insurance; 
(3)  Protecting the public safety; and 
(4)  Enhancing the value of real property, both commercial and residential. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 2, 6-9-1998)  
Sec. 34-83. - Authority. 
(a)  The city commission is authorized to fund all or any portion of the costs of providing fire protection services within the city by imposing an annual fire protection special assessment upon benefitted real property within the city based upon the special benefit received by such property from the provision of such service. 
(b)  The city commission shall impose the fire protection assessment pursuant to the procedures set forth in this article. 
(c)  The amount of the fire protection assessment imposed upon a particular parcel of real property within the city shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology designed to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of the assessed costs of providing fire protection services among the specially benefitted properties. Such methodology shall be set forth by separate resolution duly adopted by the city commission as provided in this article. 
(d)  No fire protection assessment shall be imposed upon governmental or institutional properties whose uses are wholly exempt from ad valorem taxation under state law, as those uses provide services and benefits to the public and the city which might otherwise need to be provided and funded by the city. The city commission finds that the benefits derived by the city and its residents from such uses provide a benefit to the city that are no less than the benefits these properties receive from the provision of fire protection services by the city. Hence, it is fair and reasonable not to impose the fire protection assessment upon governmental or institutional properties whose uses are wholly exempt from ad valorem taxation. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 3, 6-9-1998)  
Sec. 34-84. - Definitions.

The former Ch. 38 pertained to floods and derived from the Code of 1979, §§ 7-287-48.    Section 6 of Ord. No. 2012-0902 states: "For the purposes of jurisdictional applicability, this chapter shall apply in the City of Lighthouse Point. This chapter shall apply to all applications for development, including building permit applications and subdivision proposals, submitted on or after September 13, 2012." 
 
ARTICLE I. - ADMINISTRATION  
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL 
 
Sec. 38-1. - Title. 
These regulations shall be known as the floodplain management ordinance of the City of Lighthouse Point, hereinafter referred to as "this chapter." 
(Ord. No. 2012-0902, § 2, 9-13-2012)  
Sec. 38-2. - Scope. 
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 2012-0902, § 2, 9-13-2012)  
Sec. 38-3. - Intent. 
The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(Ord. No. 2012-0902, § 2, 9-13-2012)  
Sec. 38-4. - Coordination with the Florida Building Code.

(Ord. No. 2012-0902, § 2, 9-13-2012)  
Sec. 38-5. - Warning. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2012-0902, § 2, 9-13-2012)

The mayor will appoint a development review committee which may consist of the following individuals: The public works director; the development review official; the assistant to the mayor, fire chief, city attorney (as needed), city planner (as needed) and the city engineer (as needed) and the mayor. Additional appointments can be made by the mayor as required. Applications for development permits shall be reviewed by the development review committee within 30 calendar days of acceptance of the application; provided, however, if the application is not subject to major review and is for development of fewer than four dwelling units or less than 2,000 gross square feet of nonresidential floor area, the development review official may waive review of the application by the development review committee, but the application shall be subject to review by those agencies that the development review official deems appropriate. The development review official will determine whether a formal development review committee meeting is required for the particular application at the time of completeness review as performed in subsection (1) of this section. If a formal meeting of the development review committee is not required, the individual development review committee members will provide written comments to the development review official. The technical recommendations of the development review committee will be forwarded to the planning and zoning board for final approval. 
(5)  Meeting summary. Within ten working days of the development review committee's consideration of the application for a development permit, the development review official shall forward to the applicant a written review of matters discussed at the meeting regarding compliance with relevant regulations. 
(6)  Amendment to application. An application for a development permit may be amended by the applicant after it has been accepted. The development review official shall examine the amendment at the point in the reviewing process at which it occurs to determine if any portion of the reviewing process must be repeated. If any such portion must be repeated, the development review official is authorized to extend the time limits prescribed in this section as long as necessary to undertake such additional review, but not to exceed 30 calendar days from the date that the amendment is received. 
(7)  Required action by other county board or agencies. In the event this Code requires that a development permit not be issued until acted upon by some county board or agency other than the city commission, then the development review official shall forward the application for the development permit to such county board or agency for appropriate action prior to the issuance of a development order pursuant to subsections (8) and (10) of this section or the notification to an applicant that an application is ready to be presented to the city commission pursuant to subsection (9) of this section. The time limits of such subsections shall be extended to accommodate such additional board or agency action. 
(8)  Minor review; development order. Upon receipt of a completed application for development permit subject to minor review, the development review official shall make a determination, based upon required agency reviews that: 
a.  The application complies with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of this section, or that vested rights exist with regard to any noncompliance, in which case the development review official shall issue a development order granting the application; 
b.  The application is not in compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of this section, have been determined by the development review official to be reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of this section, and vested rights exist with regard to any noncompliance in which case the development review official shall issue a development order granting the application with such conditions; or 
c.  The application is not in compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of this section, in which case the development review official shall issue a development order denying the application. A development order denying an application shall include a statement of the basis for denial. A development order granting an application with conditions shall include a statement of such conditions and the basis therefor. 
(9)  Major review; development review report and notice to applicant. Within 35 calendar days from the acceptance of the application for development permit subject to major review, the development review official shall compile the individual staff reports, prepare a written development review report with proposed findings and a recommendation, and forward a notification of preparedness to the applicant stating that the report is complete and the application is ready to be presented to the planning and zoning board.

2.  The application is not in compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of this division, in which case the city commission shall adopt a development order denying the application; 
3.  The application is not in compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of this division but conditions have been determined by the city commission to be reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of this division, and that vested rights exist with regard to any noncompliance, in which case the city commission shall adopt a development order granting approval of the application with such conditions; or 
4.  The application is not in compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements. 
b.  A final determination by the city commission under this subsection may be deferred beyond the 35 calendar day limit in subsection (11)a of this section if the city commission finds that available information is insufficient on which to base either approval or denial of a particular application and the city commission directs or has directed that a specific study commence to provide the city commission with information sufficient to form the basis on which to approve or deny the application and the study will be completed within a time certain, not to exceed six months from the date of the city commission's determination under this subsection. Provided, however, as a prerequisite to directing that a specific study commence to provide the city commission with information sufficient to form the basis on which to approve or deny a particular application, the city commission shall identify the inadequacy of the information available with respect to the application. 
(12)  Reinstatement of development orders. An application denied in accordance with subsection (8)a or subsection (10)a of this section solely on the basis of inadequacy of the regional transportation network may be reinstated provided that all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The applicant, within seven calendar days of the denial, notifies the development review official of an intention to develop an action plan, and pays any appropriate fees established by the city commission for the review of an action plan.

1.  The development review committee shall, within 15 working days, review the action plan, and provide the applicant with its recommendations. 
2.  The applicant, within ten working days of the issuance of the development review committee recommendation, shall either: 
i.  Provide the development review official with a written authorization to proceed to the next available planning and zoning board meeting with the proposed action plan, and the proposed plat if the development order is for a plat; or 
ii.  Submit a revised action plan to the development review committee. Within ten working days of the resubmittal, the development review committee shall issue a revised report. Within ten working days of issuance of the revised report, the applicant shall provide the development review official with a written authorization to proceed to the next available planning and zoning board meeting with the proposed action plan and the proposed plat if the development order is for a plat. 
3.  Failure by the applicant to meet the time frames of subsections (12)b.2.i and ii of this section shall constitute withdrawal of the notification of intent to develop an action plan. For an application reinstated under this provision, the development review official shall submit the previous development review report and planning and zoning board findings, amended by the approved action plan, for scheduling if the application is for plat approval. The city commission shall consider the application for plat approval based on the conditions which existed at the time of the denial, except for the provisions of the approval action plan. The development review official shall approve the application for a development permit subject to minor review based upon the conditions that existed at the time of the denial, except for the provisions of the approved action plan. 
(13)  Effect of development order.

b.  No development permit shall be issued except pursuant to an effective development order. 
c.  No development permit shall be issued for a development which is inconsistent with the development order governing such development. 
(14)  Vested rights. 
a.  Existing agreements giving rise to vested rights. The city recognizes that certain property owners or developers may have claim to a vested rights based upon agreements with the city entered into prior to April 18, 1989, the adoption date of the 1989 city comprehensive plan. The city recognizes that such rights would arise in a circumstance where: 
1.  All regional roads. 
i.  The agreement provided for the developer to undertake or fund a road improvement which exceeded the developer's obligation under any plat approval; 
ii.  The agreement contains language or evidences the intent that construction of the road improvement would satisfy the obligation to ensure the adequacy of the regional road net work with regard to specified development on a described parcel which was not undergoing platting; and 
iii.  The developer acted in reliance upon the agreement and is not in default of the provisions of the agreement. 
2.  Specific road segment. 
i.  The agreement provided for the developer to undertake a road improvement which is unrelated to plat approval; 
ii.  The developer did not receive payment or credit for such improvement since it was determined that the road would be required to provide safe and adequate access to the unplatted property; 
iii.  The developer constructed the road to service his development without any compensation; and 
iv.  In such circumstances the vested trips on the road segment constructed by the developer shall not exceed the lesser of: The number of trips the road improvement can accommodate at Level of Service D or the number of trips generated on the segment by the intensity or density of development specified in the agreement. 
b.  Entitlement to impact fee credits pursuant agreement. Entitlement to impact fee credits pursuant to an agreement shall not, of itself, constitute a basis for vesting a development or the trips represented by the impact fee credits. 
c.  Additional circumstances. It is recognized that there may be additional circumstances where some vested rights have arisen which are not specified in subsections (14)a or b of this section. 
d.  Procedure for claiming vested rights. 
1.  Any property owner or developer may seek a vested rights determination regarding a specific unplatted parcel for which additional intensity or density is sought. 
2.  Requests for vested rights determination shall be made on forms provided by the development review official. The developer shall be required to state the parcel for which the vested rights determination is sought, the basis for the vested rights claim, and shall provide a copy of the agreement or other document which the developer asserts gives rise to a vested rights determination. 
3.  After the developer has submitted a complete application for a vested rights determination to the development review official it shall be forwarded to the city's attorney for review. 
4.  A hearing officer shall be appointed by the city commission to conduct an administrative hearing regarding the vested rights determination. The hearing shall be set for no later than 60 days from the date of application unless an extension of time is requested or agreed to by the applicant. 
5.  The city attorney shall represent the city in the administrative hearing. The hearing officer shall determine whether the vested rights have been created pursuant to statute or established case law. 
6.  If the city's attorney, any time before the hearing, reviews the application and finds that the application has provided clear evidence that vested rights claimed by the developer exist, the city attorney and the applicant may stipulate to the existence of vested rights. Such stipulation shall eliminate the need for a determination by the hearing officer. 
7.  If vested rights are stipulated to or found by the hearing officer, the trips attributable to such vested rights shall be placed within the county TRIPS system and shall be available to the benefitted property for a period of five years. 
8.  A determination by the hearing officer that vested rights have not arisen shall be determined to be a final decision of the county.

Secs. 42-7442-90. - Reserved.  
Subdivision II. - Development Review Requirements 
 
Sec. 42-91. - Development permit application requirements. 
An application for development permit in the city must comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Adequacy of regional road network. The adequacy of the regional transportation network shall be determined based upon conditions at the time the final plat or site plan application is submitted in accordance with the following provisions: 
a.  Level of service (LOS). For the purpose of issuing development permits, the level of service for roadways in the city is as follows: 
1.  U.S. 1 (north of Sample Road); LOS "D" 
2.  U.S. 1 (south of Sample Road): Maintain collector roadways: 
i.  LOS "C"Average annual daily traffic. 
ii.  LOS "C"Peak season daily traffic. 
iii.  LOS "C"Peak hour daily traffic. 
b.  Measurement of capacities. The procedure for the initial measurement of highway capacities is the state department of transportation Table of Generalized Daily Level of Service Maximum Volumes dated January 1, 1989, for use by local governments from January 1989 to December 1990. Alternately, highway capacity may also be determined through a detailed traffic engineering study of local conditions of traffic flow, field conditions and traffic operations. Such studies shall be technically developed and comply with proper and recognized traffic engineering procedures. All studies shall be evaluated by the city, and/or other parties as the city designates, for acceptability. In instances where the city finds that the study does not comply with proper and recognized traffic engineering procedures, the study results will not accepted. 
c.  Development subject to adequacy determination. 
1.  For plats and replats, site plans or building permits where the property is unplatted or was platted, with plat approval received before March 20, 1979, all development of previously vacant land except that specified in subsection (1)c.3 of this section shall be subject to adequacy determination. 
2.  For plats and replats, site plans or building permits where the property is unplatted or was platted, with plat approval received before March 20, 1989, all development of previously improved lands shall be subject to an adequacy determination for the additional trips to be generated by the development specified in the proposed note on the plat and the trips generated by any existing development. Existing development shall be construed to include previous development demolished no earlier than 18 months previous to the date the final plat is submitted, or the application for a site plan or building permit approval is submitted. 
3.  For a replat, or an amendment to a note on a plat, or a requirement to place a note on a plat, where property was platted after March 20, 1979, an adequate determination shall be required for those additional trips that equals the difference between the previous plat and the replat; or the previous note and the proposed amendment to the note; or the development approved by the city commission at the time of the plat approval and the proposed note to be placed on the plat. 
d.  Traffic study required. All development applications, except for development applications where the traffic generation of new trips is less than 1,000 trips per day, shall submit a study identifying the traffic impact of the proposed development. The city may also require traffic impact studies from development applications with less than 1,000 new trips per day in instances where existing traffic conditions warrants specific study. 
The traffic impact study shall identify existing traffic volumes and existing level of service for average daily, peak hour and peak season daily conditions. The study area shall include the entire city. The study shall identify the project's daily and peak hour trip generation, trip distribution and traffic assignment. An analysis of peak hour turning movements at project entrances shall be provided. Traffic conditions at project build-out shall be identified including existing traffic, background traffic and project traffic. The impact of the project traffic on the operating condition of U.S. 1 shall be identified. The impact of the project on the level of service of city collectors shall also be assessed. An evaluation of the need for traffic improvements at project entrances and at other roadway locations shall be provided. 
e.  Required determination. 
1.  Before a development permit is approved, the following findings shall be made: 
i.  The proposed development will not lower the level of service of arterials and collectors below the adopted levels. This includes U.S. 1 (north of Sample Road) below LOS "D" and U.S. 1 (south of Sample Road) LOS below the existing operating condition and city collectors below LOS "C" for average annual daily traffic (AADT), peak season daily traffic (PADT) and peak hour (PKHR). 
ii.  In instances where the proposed development will lower the level of service of city arterials and collectors below the adopted level of service, the necessary improvements to provide the adopted level of service are under construction at the time a permit is issued, or are subject of an executed contract with a road contractor for immediate construction, or the necessary improvements are provided in an enforceable development agreement and will be available prior to certificates of occupancy, or the necessary improvements are included in the city, the county or state department of transportation annual work program or capital improvement program. 
iii.  In instances where the existing level of service of city arterials and collectors are below the adopted level of service, the necessary improvements to provide adopted level of service are under construction at the time a permit is issued, or are subject of an executed contract with a road contractor for immediate construction, or the necessary improvements are provided in an enforceable development agreement and will be available prior to certificates of occupancy, or the necessary improvements are included in the city, the county or state department of transportation annual work program or capital improvement program or there is an approved action plan to accommodate the traffic impact of the development. 
iv.  The development is found to have vested rights. 
2.  Dedication of right-of-way for city arterials and collectors. The trafficways on the county trafficways plan and delineated trafficways plan approved by the county commission which are described on the city's land use plan map and traffic circulation element, which are located within the area proposed to be developed, shall be conveyed to the public by dedication on the face of the plat, deed or, if acceptable to the city and county, by grant or easement. 
f.  Satisfaction of Broward County Concurrency Standards. The burden shall be on the applicant to demonstrate compliance with the standards detailed in this section. If applicable, the development application shall be reviewed to ensure that the proposed development satisfies the Broward County Concurrency Standards for the Regional Road Network as outlined in section 5-182(a) of the Broward County Land Development Code, as amended from time to time. The applicant shall provide the necessary documentation from Broward County demonstrating satisfaction of these requirements. The applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirement by making a proportionate share contribution to an eligible transportation project located within Northeast Concurrency District, pursuant to the requirements set forth in section 5-182(a)(5)(a) of the Broward County Land Development Code as amended from time to time, and F.S. § 163.3280 as amended from time to time. 
(2)  Access to trafficways. A final plat of lands which abut or contain an existing or proposed trafficway shall be designed to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of vehicles between the trafficway and the proposed development and shall comply with the following standards and requirements:

i.  Additional right-of-way shall be conveyed to the public by dedication on the face of the plat, by deed, or, if acceptable to the county, by grant of easement which is necessary for the ultimate construction of turn lanes, bicycle facilities, sidewalks, bus pullout bays, bus shelters, or roadway drainage facilities as required pursuant to article II, division 4, subdivision II, of this chapter. 
(3)  Adequacy of water management. 
a.  The proposed development shall be designed to provide adequate areas and easements for the construction and maintenance of a water management system to serve the proposed development and adjacent public rights-of-way in a manner which conforms to sound engineering standards and principles, and which will be provided in accordance with applicable provisions of this Code and the local agency having water management review and permitting authority over the area. 
b.  The development order shall require that the applicant for a building permit demonstrate prior to the issuance of the building permit within the development that the following levels of service standards, where applicable, will be met prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
1.  Building elevation. The lowest floor elevation for buildings shall be no lower than the elevation for the respective area depicted on the "100-Year Flood Criteria Map." 
2.  Off-site discharge. Off-site discharge is not to exceed the inflow limit of South Florida Water Management District primary receiving canal or the local conveyance system. 
3.  Storm sewers. The design frequency applicable to storm sewers is the three-year rainfall intensity of the state department of transportation Zone 10 rainfall curves. 
4.  Floodplain routing. Calculated flood elevations based on the ten-year and 100-year return frequency rainfall of three-day duration shall not exceed the corresponding elevations of the ten-year "Flood Criteria Map" and the "100-Year Flood Elevation Map." 
5.  Antecedent water level. The antecedent water level is the higher elevation of either the control elevation or the elevation depicted on the map "Average Wet Season Water Levels." 
6.  On-site storage. Minimum capacity above antecedent water level and below floodplain routing elevations shall be design rainfall volume minus off-site discharge occurring during design rainfall. 
7.  Best available management practices. Prior to discharge to surface or groundwater, best available management practices will be used to reduce pollutant discharge. 
(4)  Adequacy of potable water service.

b.  A finding that potable water service is available at the adopted level of service must be based upon a demonstration that an existing water treatment facility has sufficient plant and network capacity to provide for the potable water needs of the application and for other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which potable water treatment capacity has been reserved. If potable water service is not available, but will be made available, any development order shall be conditioned on such availability. A finding that potable water service will be made available at the adopted level of service must be based upon a demonstration that there is a fiscally feasible plan to construct or expand a water treatment facility which will have sufficient plant and network capacity to provide for the potable water needs of the development proposed by the application prior to the issuance of certificates of occupancy for that development, and for other developments in the service area, which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which potable water treatment capacity has been reserved. 
c.  An agreement will be required between the county (or if applicable Pompano Beach) and the developer prior to the issuance of a building permit to provide for the expansion of water treatment facilities necessary to service the proposed development. City or county commission approval of an application for plat approval shall not be construed to effect a reservation of potable water plant or network capacity, or a commitment to provide service. 
(5)  Adequacy of wastewater treatment and disposal services. 
a.  Wastewater treatment and disposal services must be available prior to occupancy to provide for the needs of the proposed development at the adopted level of service of 150 gallons per year-round resident per day. The proposed development shall be designed to provide adequate areas and easements which may be necessary for the installation and maintenance of a wastewater disposal system which will meet all applicable health and environmental regulations.

If existing capacity is unavailable, conditional approval may be granted if it is shown that there is a fiscally feasible plan to construct or expand a wastewater treatment and disposal facility which will have sufficient plant and network capacity to provide for the treatment and disposal needs of the development proposed by the application prior to the issuance of certificates of occupancy for that development, and for other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which wastewater treatment or disposal capacity has been reserved. 
c.  An agreement will be required between the county and the developer prior to the issuance of a building permit for the expansion of water/wastewater treatment and disposal facilities necessary to service the proposed development. 
d.  City or county commission approval of an application for plat approval shall not be construed to effect a reservation of wastewater capacity or commitment to provide service. 
(6)  Adequacy of solid waste disposal sites or facilities. 
a.  Solid waste disposal sites or facilities shall be available prior to occupancy to provide for the needs of the proposed development at the level of service of five pounds per year-round resident per day. 
b.  A finding that solid waste disposal sites or facilities are available must be based upon a demonstration that existing solid waste disposal sites or facilities have sufficient capacity to provide for the solid waste disposal needs of the development proposed by the application and for other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which solid waste disposal capacity has been reserved. If existing capacity is unavailable, conditional approval may be granted if it is shown that there is an economically and fiscally feasible plan to expand solid waste disposal site so that sufficient capacity will be available for the solid waste disposal of the development proposed by the application and for other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which solid waste disposal capacity has been reserved. 
(7)  Consideration of hazardous material disposal services and impact on air quality and wellfield protection. An application for a development permit shall be reviewed to determine the adequacy of hazardous material treatment and disposal services, as well as, the proposed development's impact on air quality and wellfield protection. Review shall be pursuant to the county environmental quality control board's code of regulations, and any other standards which may be adopted by the city commission by amendment to this division. An application for a development permit may be denied or approved, with appropriate conditions where the property is subject to a notice of violation of an environmental regulation by a county, state or federal agency, which violation the city commission determines makes all or part of the land unsuitable for development. 
(8)  Adequacy of school facilities. An application for a development permit shall be reviewed to determine the adequacy of educational facilities to serve the needs of the future residents of the developed area. 
(9)  Protection of air navigation. If the plat or site plan includes property subject to notice requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77, Subpart B, development within the plat or site plan must receive an Federal Aviation Administration determination that it does not constitute a hazard to air navigation or require operational modifications to the airport to avoid such a hazard. The note on the plat or site plan shall specify this restriction.

Sec. 42-137. - Driveway entrance from public right-of-way. 
If a driveway connects development to a trafficway, or a street within a trafficway corridor, the provisions of subsection 42-145(9)b. shall apply. The following requirements apply to driveways connecting development to a nontrafficway corridor street. 
(1)  Design requirements. 
a.  The area within the development to which the driveway provides access shall be of sufficient size to allow all necessary functions for loading, unloading, and parking maneuvers to be carried out on private property and completely off the street right-of-way unless waived by the development review committee and planning and zoning board. 
b.  The minimum distance from the ultimate right-of-way line at any ingress or egress driveway to any interior service drive or parking stall with direct access to such driveway shall be 22 feet. 
c.  In the case of a main ingress or egress point to a public street or highway from a site of a major development that provides more than 1,000 trips per day such as a shopping center or multiple-family development the minimum distance from the ultimate right-of-way line of the driveway to any interior service drive or parking stall having direct access to such driveway shall be based on the amount of traffic utilizing the drive as determined by the development review committee and planning and zoning board. 
(2)  Number and location of driveway entrances. In order to provide the maximum safety with the least interference to the traffic flow on public streets, and to provide ease and convenience in ingress and egress to private property, the number and location of driveways shall be regulated relative to the intensity or size of the property served and the amount of frontage which that property has on a given street as follows: 
a.  One driveway shall be permitted for ingress and egress purposes to a single property or development. 
b.  Two driveways entering on a particular street from a single property or development may be permitted if all other requirements of this section are met and if the minimum driveway spacing between the two driveways equals or exceeds 50 feet. 
c.  Three driveways entering on a particular street from a single property or development may be permitted if all other requirements of this section are met and if the minimum driveway spacing between adjacent driveways equals or exceeds 100 feet. 
d.  In general, not more than three driveways will be permitted from a single property or development. However, in the case of extensive property development (property exceeding ten acres in total land area and/or containing more than 1,000 parking stalls), additional driveways may be permitted provided all other requirements of this section are met and the minimum driveway spacing between adjacent driveways equals or exceeds 300 feet. 
e.  The minimum driveway spacing between driveways on adjacent properties shall be 50 feet. This driveway spacing may be modified by the development review committee and planning and zoning board if a traffic engineering study acceptable to the city demonstrates that public safety will not be adversely affected by such modification. 
(3)  Driveway entrance width according to type. 
a.  Ramp-type or swale-type entrance. Except as provided in subsection (3)b of this section, all driveways shall be constructed with the standard ramp-type or swale type driveway entrance and shall conform to the width requirements in the city's design standards. 
b.  Street-type driveway entrance. Construction of a street-type driveway shall be required for entrances of any development which includes a parking area for 300 or more vehicles or where the development anticipates substantial loading or trucking operations. Such driveway shall be a minimum width of 30 feet and a maximum width of 60 feet. 
(4)  Limitations on driveway entrance improvements. 
a.  There shall be a minimum of 15 feet of straight tangent length between a driveway and the radius return or chord of the ultimate right-of-way line of an intersection of local streets. At all other intersections the minimum straight tangent length shall be 50 feet. 
b.  There shall be a minimum of 45 feet between the closest radius return of a driveway and the intersection of local street ultimate right-of-way lines. At all other intersections the distance shall be 80 feet. 
c.  No driveway entrance shall include any public facility such as traffic signal poles, crosswalks, loading zones, utility facilities, fire alarm supports, meter boxes, sewer clean outs, or other similar type structures. 
d.  Within the ultimate right-of-way limits, the maximum recommended driveway grade is approximately three percent. The maximum allowable grade is 4.2 percent or one-half inch per foot. The maximum slope immediately beyond the ultimate right-of-way line shall not change in excess of five percent for either angle of approach or break-over angle. Variations from these standards shall be permitted if adherence to these standards would cause incompatibility with existing swales. 
e.  Existing driveways approaches shall not be relocated, altered, or reconstructed without approval for relocation, alteration, or reconstruction of such driveway approaches. When the use of any driveway approach is changed, making any portion or all of the driveway approach unnecessary, the developer of the abutting property shall obtain a permit to abandon the driveway approach and shall, at the developer's expense, replace all necessary curbs, gutters, swale areas and sidewalks. 
f.  If the closest intersection involves two streets classified as arterial and collector, then traffic movements to and from any driveway within 125 feet of an intersection with an collector and 250 feet of an intersection with an arterial shall be limited to right turns only unless waived by the development review committee and planning and zoning board. 
g.  No driveway shall be constructed prior to issuance of a permit for work in the right-of-way by the appropriate governmental agency.

Sec. 42-139. - Sight distance. 
(a)  Cross-visibility requirements at the intersection of driveways and public rights-of-way. If a driveway intersects a public right-of-way, there shall be no sight obstruction within a triangular area of property on both sides of a driveway formed by the intersection of each side of the driveway and the ultimate right-of-way line with two sides of each triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the two other sides. 
(b)  Cross-visibility requirements at pedestrian crosswalks and other areas of pedestrian concentration. If a crosswalk intersects a vehicular access aisle, driveway or an ultimate right-of-way, there shall be not sight obstruction within a triangular area of property on both sides of a crosswalk or walkway formed by the intersection of each side of the walkway and the ultimate right-of-way line or aisle with two sides of each triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side of the triangle being a line connecting the ends of the two sides. 
(c)  Sight triangles. 
(1)  Within the triangular areas described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, it shall not be permissible to install, set out to maintain, or to allow the installation, setting out or maintenance of, either temporarily or permanently, any vehicular parking space, sign, wall, hedge, shrubbery, tree, earth mound, natural growth or other obstruction of any kind which obstructs cross-visibility at a level between 30 inches and eight feet above the level of the center of the adjacent intersection. Any wall or fence within the sight triangle must be constructed in such a manner as to provide adequate cross-visibility over or through the structure between 30 inches and eight feet in height above the driving surface. 
(2)  The following will be permitted within the triangular area described above: 
a.  Trees having limbs and foliage trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into the area between 30 inches and eight feet above the level of the center of the adjacent intersection.

Sec. 42-142. - Pervious area and greenspace. 
(a)  The area covered by structures and impervious surface shall not exceed 75 percent for commercial and 75 percent for residential uses. For the purposes of this requirement all other uses, such as, but not limited to, utilities, transportation and office park, shall be included in the commercial category. In mixed use developments, the most restrictive of the applicable impervious area limitations shall be utilized. 
(1)  Pervious areas may be used to satisfy requirements for landscaping and setbacks, buffer strips, drainfields, passive recreation areas, or any other purpose that does not require covering with a material that prevents infiltration of water into the ground. 
(2)  In the case of the use of an impervious material which does not cover all the surface to which it is applied, credit towards the computation of the pervious area shall be given according to the percentage of pervious area that is retained. 
a.  Pervious paving blocks may not be used within major driveways, loading zones, actively used parking stalls in commercial or industrial developments, or any other area that may cause a liability to the property owner. 
b.  Pervious paving blocks may be used in overflow parking areas, park and recreation parking facilities, and residential areas. In all cases where the pervious paving blocks are used where pedestrian traffic is prevalent, the block voids shall be planted with a nonrunner species of grass such as, but not limited to, zoysia and bermuda grass. 
(3)  In cases where the city zoning code allows some required parking stalls to be grassed, no credit towards the computation of pervious area shall be granted for such areas. 
(4)  Upon demonstration by the applicant that special conditions peculiar to the location or physical characteristics of a particular site are present, or special conditions resulting from the design of existing facilities or surrounding land uses are present, the development review committee and planning and zoning board may permit variation from the impervious area standards, subject to the following limitations: 
a.  Variation from the stated requirements shall be proportional to mitigating design improvements provided in excess of the minimum required engineering and landscaping standards. The impervious area shall not exceed 85 percent for commercial and 70 percent for residential uses.

iii.  Number of location of driveways. The number and location of driveways shall be determined as follows: 
(a)  Spacing of driveways. 
(1) To allow for proper corner clearance, the minimum curb length between a minor driveway and an intersection shall be 50 feet unless waived by the development review committee and planning and zoning board. 
(2) If the closest intersection involves two streets classified as arterial or collector, then traffic movements to and from any driveway within 660 feet of an intersection with a collector and 760 feet of an intersection with an arterial shall be limited to right turns only unless waived by the development review committee and planning and zoning board. 
(3) Minimum acceptable spacing between intermediate or major driveways and an intersection shall be similar to the criteria for intersections of local streets with a trafficway or collector. 
(b)  Frontage. 
(1) One driveway shall be permitted for ingress and egress purposes to a single property or development. 
(2) Two driveways entering a particular arterial street from a single property or de velopment may be permitted if all other requirements of this section are met and if the minimum distance between the adjacent driveways conforms to the minimum spacing requirements of subsection (9)b.4.iii. of this section. 
(3) Three driveways entering a particular arterial street from a single property or development may be permitted if all other requirements of these regulations are met and if the minimum distance between adjacent driveways conforms to the minimum spacing re quirements of subsection (9)b.4.iii. of this section. 
(4) A joint access driveway will be considered as adequate access for any two adjacent developments. For a development where additional driveways are being requested and where those driveways do not meet the spacing requirements, the applicant shall be required to submit a brief traffic report justifying the need, describing the internal circulation and parking system, and identifying the impact of the development and its proposed access facilities on the operation of the trafficway corridor. 
(c)  Driveway centerline spacing requirements within trafficway corridor. The minimum distance between center lines of two-way driveways shall conform to the city's design standards. For those driveways with left-turn movements, median opening spacing requirements shall have precedence. Driveway centerline spacing may be increased if the required turn lane storage or transition is increased by any governmental agency. Minimum driveway centerline spacing may be decreased if one-way driveways are utilized and accepted by the development review committee, planning and zoning board and appropriate agency. 
(d)  Special driveway requirements. In the case of a land use with special driveway needs, an applicant may submit a traffic engineering study requesting technical deviations from the requirements of this section. If deviations from driveway requirements are permitted, substitute requirements which deviate no more than necessary to serve the special land use needs may be applied to the development in order to minimize the impact on the adjacent street. Such deviations from the driveway requirements shall be approved by the development review committee, planning and zoning board and the appropriate agency. 
(e)  Replacement of abandoned driveway within a trafficway corridor. Existing driveway approaches shall not be relocated, altered, or reconstructed without approval for relocation, alteration, or reconstruction or such driveway approaches.

a. A right-turn lane shall be provided if the street's speed limit equals or exceeds 35 miles per hour or if the development will generate 100 or more right turns during the peak hours. 
b. A left turn lane shall be provided if the street's speed limit equals or exceeds 35 miles per hour or if the development will generate 25 or more left turns during the peak hour. 
(4) Required storage and transition lengths may be modified where conditions warrant and are acceptable to the development review committee, planning and zoning board and appropriate agency. When storage and transition lengths are so modified, the minimum distances set forth in the city's design standards may be correspondingly adjusted if appropriate. 
(g)  Frontage roads within the public right-of-way. All driveway access along arterials with existing or planned frontage roads shall be provided to such frontage roads. To gain temporary direct access to the arterial, the developer shall construct the section of the frontage road adjacent to the property. The frontage road section shall be located where planned. Any right-of-way not previously dedicated shall be dedicated prior to issuance of a temporary driveway permit providing direct access to the arterial. If driveway access is provided from frontage roads, driveway spacing and property clearance and minimum lot width requirements under this section may be reduced by one-third. However, minimum driveway spacing for temporary direct access to the arterial should be adequate to ensure safe traffic operation at the design speed. 
(h)  Access between trafficway and private property. 
(1)  Access easement. Easement for and construction of access on private property shall be required when property that abuts an existing or proposed roadway does not or will not align with an approved median access or when the location of the property will prohibit adjacent properties of similar land use from gaining access to an approved median opening. The easement shall guarantee the interconnection to and through such properties for access to and from the divided roadway. 
(2)  Location. The intersection of any portion of an access easement with that portion that contains the driveway shall conform to the minimum depth of the appropriate driveway type as required by this section. 
(3)  Design. The minimum pavement width for the two-way access shall be 24 feet. 
(i)  Off-street vehicular circulation. Where a development is located on a street within a trafficway corridor the parking facility shall have full internal vehicular circulation and storage. Vehicular circulation must be completely contained within the property and vehicles located within one portion of the development must have access to all other portions without using the adjacent street system. 
(j)  Off-street truck maneuvering. Where a proposed development includes a truck-loading operation and has access to a street within a trafficway corridor, adequate space shall be provided when the speed limit equals or exceeds 35 miles per hour or if the development will generate 100 or more right turns during the peak hours. 
(k)  Off-street vehicle reservoir areas. Adequate reservoir capacity shall be required for both inbound and outbound vehicles to facilitate the safe and efficient movement between the street and the development. An inbound reservoir shall be of sufficient size to ensure that vehicles will not obstruct the adjacent street, sidewalk and circulation within the facility. An outbound reservoir shall be required to eliminate backup and delay of vehicles within the development.

The design of local streets shall comply with the requirements of the provisions of the city's design standards depending on the type of development proposed. Deviations may be allowed but only where approved by the development review committee, planning and zoning board and city upon a finding that substantially equivalent protection of the public safety can be achieved by alternative standards. Provided however, that no alternative standard having more than a ten percent deviation from the numerical standard stated below shall be permitted. If a proposed development includes more than one type of use, the highest criteria shall apply. 
(1)  Residential development. 
a.  Generally. Residential streets shall be adequate to permit neighborhood traffic circulation to flow from the highest element of the hierarchial classification, the expressway, arterial or collector, to the lowest element, the local residential street. Circulation within a residential development shall be adequate when the criteria of the city's standards are met and when collectors and local streets are provided which meet the standards of the comprehensive plan. 
b.  Residential collector street. The residential collector street serves as the principal circulation facility within the residential neighborhood unit. Its function is to collect traffic from the interior and deliver it to the closest perimeter intra-neighborhood transportation between the residential units and the local centers of attraction such as neighborhood shopping centers, schools, and neighborhood parks. 
(2)  Commercial development. 
a.  Generally. Commercial development shall be designed to satisfy the needs generated by residential development. The size and location of the proposed commercial development shall be appropriate to support the proposed use. 
b.  Pedestrian access. Neighborhood and community commercial facilities shall have an efficient and direct pedestrian connection to the residential areas the facilities are intended to serve.

(a)  This section implements the policy of the City of Lighthouse Point for processing of requests for reasonable accommodation to its ordinances, rules, policies, and procedures for persons with disabilities as provided by the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (42 U.S.C. 3601, et seq.) ("FHA") and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Section 12131 et seq.) ("ADA"). For purposes of this section, a "disabled" individual or person is an individual that qualifies as disabled and/or handicapped under the FHA and/or ADA. Any person who is disabled (or qualifying entities) may request a reasonable accommodation with respect to the City's land use or zoning laws, rules, policies, practices and/or procedures as provided by the FHA and the ADA pursuant to the procedures set out in this section. 
(b)  A request by an applicant for reasonable accommodation under this section shall be made in writing by completion of a reasonable accommodation request form, which form is maintained by (and shall be submitted to) the city administrator. The reasonable accommodation request form shall contain such questions and requests for information as are necessary for processing the reasonable accommodation request. The reasonable accommodation request form shall be substantially in the form set forth herein. 
(c)  Should the information provided by the applicant or disabled individual to the city include medical information or records, including records indicating the medical condition, diagnosis or medical history of the disabled individual, such individual may, at the time of submitting such medical information, request that the city, to the extent allowed by law, treat such medical information as confidential information of the disabled individual. The city shall thereafter endeavor to provide written notice to the applicant or disabled individual, and/or their representative, of any request received by the city for disclosure of the medical information or documentation which the disabled individual has previously requested, be treated as confidential by the city. The city will cooperate with the applicant or disabled individual, to the extent allowed by law, in actions initiated by such individual to oppose the disclosure of such medical information or documentation, but the city shall have no obligation to initiate, prosecute or pursue any such action, or to incur any legal or other expenses (whether by retention of outside counselor allocation of internal resources) in connection therewith, and may comply with any judicial order without prior notice to the applicant or disabled individual. 
(d)  The city administrator shall have the authority to consider and act on requests for reasonable accommodation, after notice and public hearing to receive comments, input and information from the public (provided, however, the city administrator or designee shall not be required to render their decision at said public hearing). Alternatively, the city administrator may refer an application to the city's planning and zoning board for determination. 
(e)  When a reasonable accommodation request form has been completed and submitted to the city administrator, the city administrator or planning and zoning board for matters referred to it by the city administrator, shall issue a written determination within 45 days of the date of the city's receipt of a completed reasonable accommodation request form, subject to additional time for additional information pursuant to subsection (f), and may, in accordance with federal law: 
1.  Grant the accommodation request; 
2.  Grant a portion of the request and deny a portion of the request, and/or impose conditions upon the grant of the request; or 
3.  Deny the request, in accordance with applicable law. 
Any such denial shall be in writing and shall state the grounds therefor. All written determinations shall give notice of the right to appeal. The notice of determination shall be sent to the requesting party (i.e. the disabled individual or his/her representative) by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(g)  If reasonably necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the city administrator or planning and zoning board, may, prior to the end of said 45-day period, request additional information from the requesting party, specifying in sufficient detail what information is required. The requesting party shall have 15 days after the date of the request for additional information to provide the requested information. In the event a request for additional information is made, the 45-day period to issue a written determination shall no longer be applicable, and the city administrator or planning and zoning board shall issue a written determination within 30 days after the city's receipt of the additional information. If the requesting party fails to provide the requested additional information within said 15-day period, the city administrator or planning and zoning board shall issue and written notice advising that the requesting party had failed to timely submit the additional information, and therefore the request for reasonable accommodation shall be deemed abandoned and/or withdrawn and no further action by the city with regard to said reasonable accommodation request shall be required. 
(h)  In determining whether the reasonable accommodation request shall be granted or denied, the requesting party shall be required to establish that they are protected under the FHA and/or ADA by demonstrating that they are a disabled person. For purposes of this section, a "disabled person" is an individual that qualifies as disabled and/or handicapped under the FHA and/or ADA. The word "individual" shall include, for purposes of this section, multiple people, or qualified entities. 
The requesting party will have to demonstrate that the proposed accommodations being sought are reasonable and necessary to afford handicapped/disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing. The foregoing (as interpreted by the courts) shall be the basis for a decision, upon a reasonable accommodation request, made by the city administrator, planning and zoning board, or by the city commission in the event of an appeal. 
(i)  The city administrator's determination on a reasonable accommodation request may be appealed pursuant to sections 42-281 through 42-284 of the city's Code. A determination by the planning and zoning board may be appealed pursuant to section 42-284 of the city's Code. Unless the timeframe is waived by the applicant, appeals to the planning and zoning board shall be conducted within 30 days of the request for appeal, and appeals from the planning and zoning board to the city commission shall be conducted within 30 days of the request for the appeal 
(j)  There shall be no fee imposed by the city in connection with a request for reasonable accommodation under this section. An appeal of a determination of the city administration or of the planning and zoning board shall be subject to the same fee as other appeals filed pursuant sections 42-281 through 42-284 of the city's Code. The city shall have no obligation to pay a requesting party's (or an appealing party's, as applicable) attorneys' fees or costs in connection with the request, or an appeal. 
(k)  While a request for a reasonable accommodation, or appeal of a determination of same, is pending before the city, the city will not enforce the subject zoning ordinance, rules, policies, and procedures against the applicant. 
(l)  The following general provisions shall be applicable:

Sec. 42-385. - Satellite dish antennas. 
(a)  As used herein, "satellite dish antenna" means any device incorporating a reflective surface that is solid, open mesh, or bar configured and is in the shape of a shallow dish, cone, horn, cornucopia, or flat plate. Such device shall be used to receive or transmit radio or electromagnetic waves between terrestrially and/or orbitally based units. This definition is meant to include but not be limited to what is commonly referred to as satellite earth stations, satellite receivers, satellite discs, direct broadcast system (DBSs), television reception only systems (TVROs), and satellite microwave antennas. 
(b)  No satellite dish antenna shall be erected within the boundaries of the city without a permit from the city. No satellite dish antenna shall be erected on any property without complying with all of the following applicable provisions. No more than one satellite dish antenna may be located on a parcel of land zoned as set forth above except as hereinafter provided. 
(c)  Application for a permit shall be made to the city building department by the owners of the land and the persons in possession of the land accompanied by a dimensioned site plan of the parcel of land upon which the satellite dish antenna is to be located, which plan shall show the parcel of land in question, all structures located on such land and the proposed location of the satellite dish antenna. It shall also be accompanied by the manufacturer's installation requirements and product specifications. The city building official may require any additional information that would assist in determining visual intrusion, structural safety or otherwise assist in issuing the permit. 
(d)  All satellite dish antennas and supporting reinforced concrete slabs, except for those permitted for roof installation as hereinafter provided, shall be permanently affixed to the ground and shall be constructed in accordance with the provisions of the Florida Building Code, and Broward County Administrative Provisions, as may be amended from time to time, and the city building code. 
(e)  The location of the satellite dish antenna shall be in the following locations on the property with priority to the lower numbered locations over any higher numbered locations: 
(1)  Within the building area of the lot. 
(2)  Within the rear setback area of the lot. If the rear of the property is located on water the satellite dish antennas shall be located as close to the house as possible, but no closer than ten feet to the water. In rear waterfront lots the dish shall be at least four feet from the side lot line. 
(3)  Within the side setback except that no dish shall be permitted in a street side setback area. 
(4)  If all of the above locations do not provide for receipt of a reasonable number of satellite signals due to tree, structure or other interference, then the dish may be mounted on an approved support pole so that the dish may be raised to a height not in excess of 30 feet, but in no event any higher than is necessary to receive a reasonable amount of transmitted satellite signals. In all such pole-support structures the pole shall be anchored to the house for safety and support purposes. If the satellite dish antenna cannot receive a reasonable amount of transmitted satellite signals at the 30-foot height, then the owner and occupant may petition the city planning and zoning board for a variance to exceed such height, but in no event any higher than 40 feet. The planning and zoning board shall consider applicant's right to reasonable satellite signal reception but not necessarily optimal signal reception in considering the height variance. The variance application shall be accompanied by a fee as provided in Appendix A of this Code, and notice shall be sent to the owners of properties lying within 200 feet of the applicant's property. All height measurements, whether 30 feet in height or up to 40 feet in height, shall be measured from normal ground level. 
(5)  The choice of locations in sequence order shall be based on each location's ability to receive direct reception of unencrypted and authorized reception of encrypted satellite television transmissions. This shall not mean any one location must be able to receive optimal number of signals but such that satellite signal reception is not unreasonably hindered or technically impossible. 
(f)  No satellite dish antenna shall be placed upon the roof of any structure situated on any property within the city other than property zoned RM-25, B-1, B-2, B-2A, B-3, or B-3A, and on such RM-25 and commercial-zoned property two satellite dish antennas may be installed. 
(g)  The dish or bowl of the satellite dish antenna shall not exceed ten feet in diameter. 
(h)  On property zoned RM-25 or for business use, the satellite dish antenna shall be placed either within the 15-foot rear setback area or on the roof of the commercial building, at the option of the owner or person in possession of the property. No more than two satellite dish antennas shall be located on any such zoned property. 
(i)  All satellite dish antennas and supporting masts shall be made of noncombustible and corrosive-resistant materials, be black or gray in color or such other color that is neutral or such that it may blend with the surrounding area where it is to be installed. The administrative assistant to the mayor shall make such determination that any other color is neutral if such color blends with the surrounding dominant color, such color helps camouflage the satellite dish antenna and such color is neither bright nor metallic. All satellite dish antennas shall be adequately grounded for protection against a direct stroke of lightning, with an adequate ground wire. 
(j)  No advertising in any form shall be permitted on any part of the satellite dish antenna, except for a maximum 11-inch by four-inch display of the manufacturer's or distributor's company name. Such display may not be on the convex side, nor on the upper 50 percent of the concave side. Such advertising may be divided into two parts, the total not exceeding 11 inches by four inches, one located on the feedhorn and one located in the center of the dish on the concave side.

Sec. 42-411. - Limitations on use of required parking facilities. 
On any property which is zoned B-1, B-2, B-2A, B-3 and B-3A, the following uses and activities shall not be permitted in required parking facilities. 
(1)  Parking to serve an off-site building unless in accordance with an off-street parking agreement approved by the city in accordance with section 42-412. 
(2)  Storage, repair or display of any vehicles, equipment or merchandise. 
(3)  Parking of vehicles, which due to their size, shape, contents or location creates an obstruction or public safety hazard, or which cannot be contained within a single designated parking space. 
(4)  Off-street parking facilities supplied by the owner or operator to meet the requirements of this article shall not be used by commercial vehicles owned, operated or used in the business of such owner during regular hours. 
(5)  Required parking areas, landscape areas, swales, parkways, traveled rights-of-way, and sidewalks shall not be used for either parking, repair or storage of inoperative or unregistered vehicles, boats or trailers, except in an emergency situation and for no longer than 24 hours within a seven-day period. 
(Code 1979, ch. 21, § 5.56)  
Sec. 42-412. - Parking other than on-site location. 
(a)  The off-street parking facilities required under this article shall be located on the same lot or parcel of land the facilities are intended to serve, or upon an additional parcel of land, the nearest property line of which is located within 500 or 1000 feet in the case of valet parking, airline measurement, of the nearest property line of the premises it is intended to serve. All off-street parking facilities required under this article shall be located on property whereon off-street parking use is a permissible use and shall be designed, developed, and maintained in accordance with all applicable provisions of this Code. 
(b)  Except for required off-street parking associated solely with outdoor dining, when the required off-street parking is to be provided upon an additional parcel of land as hereinabove provided, the owner of the additional parcel of land to be used for off-street parking facilities, and the owner of the land intended to be served by the off-street parking facilities located on the additional parcel, shall enter into an agreement with the city whereby the land providing the additional parking area shall never be sold or disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the building or the use which the additional parking area serves, so long as the parking facilities are required. The agreement shall be approved by the city attorney and recorded in the public records of the county, at the expense of the owner, and shall be considered to be a restriction running with the land and shall bind the heirs, successors, and assigns of the owner. However, another additional parcel or parcels complying with the provisions of this article and subject to a recorded agreement as above specified may be substituted for the additional parcel of land. In the case of a new or substitute agreement for the use of a parcel of additional land to meet off-street parking requirements, the original or preceding agreement shall become void by the execution and recording of the new agreement. 
(c)  For purposes of this section, "owner" shall be deemed to include lessees of property under long-term leases wherein the lessees right to possession of the property is for a period of not less than 50 years from the date of the agreement and where the owner of the fee has joined in the execution of the agreement for purposes of consenting to the terms of the agreement. Any termination of a lease for additional parking area as between the lessee and the fee owner will not negate the lessee's requirement to maintain adequate parking for all permissible use. 
(d)  When an establishment for dining and consumption of alcoholic beverages on premises requires additional off-street parking pursuant to section 42-410(11)(b), the required off-street parking may be provided on an additional parcel that meets the criteria listed in subsection (a) herein, through an arrangement acceptable to and approved by the city commission, such as cross-parking agreements, shared parking agreements, and parking leases, provided: 
(1)  Any such arrangement shall not be permitted unless the parking available on the additional parcel exceeds the parking required for all uses on the additional parcel, unless a traffic study approved by the city's community development director supports shared parking based on peak and off-peak hours for the outdoor dining and the uses on the additional parcel; and, 
(2)  If, at any time, the parking arrangement terminates, or the parking on the additional parcel ceases to be sufficient for all uses on the additional parcel as well as the outdoor dining, then the establishment for dining and consumption of alcoholic beverages shall cease all outdoor dining that required the parking on the additional parcel until such time as another arrangement is approved by the city commission.

(b)  Where any structure is enlarged or any use is extended so that the size of the resulting occupancy comes within the scope of this section, the full amount of off-street loading space shall be supplied and maintained for the structure or use in its enlarged or extended size. Where the use of a structure or land or any part thereof is changed to a use requiring an off-street loading space, such space shall be supplied and maintained to comply with this section. 
(c)  For the purposes of this section, an off-street loading space shall be an area at the grade level at least ten feet wide by 25 feet long with a 14-foot vertical clearance. Each off-street loading space shall be directly accessible from a street or alley without crossing or entering any other required loading space, and shall be arranged for convenient and safe ingress and egress by motor truck and/or trailer combination.

(Code 1979, ch. 21, § 5.62; Ord. No. 2015-0921, § 2, 1-27-2015)  
Sec. 42-434. - Landscape specifications. 
The following landscape specifications shall be considered as the minimum acceptable standard. The planning and zoning board may, where the owner of a parcel of land shows substantial compliance with provisions of this division, amend or change any requirements whenever such amendment or change would be in the best interest of the city and where the literal enforcement of the minimum standards would impose an undue hardship on the property owner. As used herein substantial compliance shall be deemed to require that if a given provision can not be complied with due to the unusual shape or nature of the property, then the number of plants, shrubs, ground cover and trees as would be required shall be located on another portion of the property as to meet the objectives of this division, taking into consideration the particular configuration and location of the parcel of land and the existing structures located thereon. 
(1)  Perimeter landscaping. Perimeter landscaping shall be as follows: 
a.  Layout. The two-foot perimeter landscape area shall be determined by starting at the outside perimeter lot or parcel line and measuring perpendicularly there from two feet to the interior perimeter planting strip line. Where two parcels of land are adjacent to each other on the side or rear lot lines and both are business-zoned properties then they shall have one of the two following options available to them: 
1.  The owners of the two parcels, or the lessees with the written consent of the owners, can agree to cooperate on a contiguous boarder strip of 1½ feet on each parcel, making a three-foot interior perimeter planting strip. If such option is elected the owners and lessees of both parcels shall be responsible for the full maintenance and care of the entire three-foot strip. 
2.  Each owner or lessee shall place a full two-foot interior perimeter landscaping strip on their property without any consideration being given to the adjacent parcel or its two-foot planting strip. There shall be exempted from the perimeter landscaping strip the following areas: 
i.  Any portion of the two-foot perimeter strip upon which a building is physically located. 
ii.  Any portion of the rear perimeter lot line which is adjacent to any residentially zoned property, provided there is a wall in existence along such rear perimeter lot line in compliance with this Code. If there be no wall in existence or not in compliance with such Code then the rear perimeter lot line shall be landscaped in full compliance with this division. 
iii.  Any portion required by subsection 42-409(h) for an access way from the parcel of land through the two-foot perimeter planting strip to a dedicated public road. The balance of the street frontage not involved with access ways shall be landscaped in accordance with the perimeter planting strip provisions set out herein. 
b.  Planting requirements. Within the two-foot perimeter landscaping area and commencing at the intersection of the side lot or parcel line and the main street frontage lot or parcel line, westerly along the main street frontage there shall be two trees planted for the first 45 lineal feet, thereafter there shall be one tree planted for each additional 30 lineal feet or a major fraction thereof. Such trees shall be properly spaced allowing for access ways. In addition to the planting of trees, shrubs and hedging material shall be planted, at most, on 2½-foot centers between all trees. All portions of the two-foot perimeter landscaping area, not covered by shrubs and hedging material or trees, shall be planted with full grass sod which shall be clean and reasonably free of noxious weeds, or shall be covered by mulch, decorative stone, bark chips or other horticulturally suitable ground cover. 
(2)  Interior landscaping. Interior landscaping shall be as follows: 
a.  Interior planting area. The gross square footage of the lot or parcel of land shall be calculated. There shall be subtracted from such gross square footage the square footage of any structures and any area encompassed under the overhang of any roof that may extend beyond the side walls of the building. There shall further be subtracted from such gross square footage the total square footage of the total two-foot perimeter planting strip provided for under subsection (1) of this section. Ten percent of the square footage thus arrived at shall be called the "interior planting area." The "interior planting area" shall be the minimum amount of interior area of the lot or parcel of land which shall be planted with trees, shrubs or ground cover as provided for in subsection (2)b of this section. 
b.  Location requirement. The "interior planting area" shall include planter islands. Each planter island shall be a minimum of five feet wide by 15 feet long and shall be placed among parking spaces on such interior lot or parcel of land and shall further be placed no more than ten parking spaces apart nor less than five parking spaces apart and shall also be at the terminus of all rows of parking unless the row of parking ends at a perimeter planting strip. Each planter island shall contain at least one tree and five shrubs. All portions of the planter island not covered by shrubs or trees shall be planted in full grass sod which shall be clean and reasonably free of noxious weeds, or shall be covered by mulch, decorative stone, bark chips or other horticulturally suitable ground cover. The perimeter of all planter islands shall be encased in a barrier made of either concrete curbing, railroad ties, car stop bumpers or other solid permanent material, all of which shall be at least six inches in height and be placed so as to inhibit any vehicles from encroaching onto the planter islands. Any remaining portion of the "interior planting area" that is not contained in the planter islands, thus leaving a portion of the "interior planting area" still unlandscaped, shall be designed and located and planted within the lot or parcel of land in accordance with accepted practices of landscape architects so that when completed the lot or parcel of land shall contain a landscaped area equal to the total square footage required for the "interior planting area" calculated in subsection (2)a of this section. 
(3)  Exemption. There shall be exempted from the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, which deals with interior landscaping, any property for which a current city local business license is issued for the following permitted business uses, to wit: New and used automobile sales as provided for in subsection 42-350(a)(3). Should any such property cease to operate under the above business category, then the property shall forthwith comply with the interior landscaping requirements of subsection (2) of this section and shall thereafter continue to comply with such provisions regardless of whatever future permitted use the property may be used for.

Sec. 42-435. - New plans. 
Prior to the two-year waiting period within which compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be required, should any building, presently in existence, apply for a building permit to renovate the building so as the renovation costs equal 20 percent of the assessed valuation of the present structure then the plans shall provide for the compliance with all of the provisions of this division and no certificate of occupancy shall issue until there has been full compliance with all of the provisions of this division and no certificate of occupancy shall issue until there has been full compliance with all of the provisions of this division.

Sec. 42-437. - Parking space requirements. 
With the exception of land that is unimproved on January 23, 1990, any parcel of land that has lost any parking spaces due to the construction of a required planter island shall be given credit for such parking spaces with respect to any other provisions of this Code dealing with off-street parking. As to unimproved land on the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived, at such time as improvements are constructed upon such land, then, should such parcel of land be capable of providing all off-street parking, in addition to the planter islands required herein, then all such off-street parking shall be provided on such property. To the extent than any off-street parking cannot be provided on such parcel of land due to the construction of the required planter island, then, only to the extent necessary, credit for parking spaces shall be given for the number of planter islands constructed and needed for compliance with the off-street parking requirements. 
(Code 1979, ch. 21, § 5.66)  
Sec. 42-438. - Enforcement. 
Any person who is charged with the responsibility of the compliance of this division, and who violates this division, shall be punishable as provided for in section 1-7 of this Code, or, at the option of the city, should the violation be processed through the city code enforcement board, then punishment shall be as provided for in section 2-260 of this Code.

b.  Lack of area to comply because property is completely covered by structures and/or has no available parking area or perimeter area within which to comply with the landscaping provisions; 
c.  Existing landscaping in place which, though it does not literally conform to the terms of the ordinance, may be given some consideration or credit for landscaping materials; or 
d.  Other extreme unusual conditions except that such may not be based upon the fact that the ordinance requires extensive landscaping due to the size of the property or causes a loss of usable parking spaces. 
(2)  Such application shall be filed with the city clerk, shall be accompanied by a survey as provided for in subsection 42-433(4)a, plus a drawing prepared to scale depicting the property, building, parking spaces and landscape material and reflecting what the property would look like if the special exception requested by the applicant were granted, all of the above so as to enable the planning and zoning board and city commission to determine the criteria for the granting of a special exception, if any. All applications for granting of a special exception shall be accompanied by the fee provided in Appendix A of this Code. The application shall set forth in detail the special exception requested and the reasons and existing conditions which the applicant feels justify the granting of the requested special exception. 
(3)  The planning and zoning board shall consider all facts and conditions that they may deem appropriate under the circumstances and shall either grant the special exception, deny the special exception or grant a conditional special exception, which conditional exception shall specify, in detail, the requirements that shall be considered in compliance with the provisions of this division. 
(b)  Orders and decisions. 
(1)  The order and decision of the planning and zoning board, in every case submitted to it for consideration, shall be in writing and shall be in conformity with the decision made and contained in the minutes of the planning and zoning board meeting.

(4)  Any application considered by the board and received less than an affirmative majority vote of the entire planning and zoning board is automatically denied. 
(5)  In granting any special exception, the planning and zoning board shall have the power to attach to its approval any reasonable conditions, limitations or requirements found necessary by the board to effectuate the provisions of this article and to carry out the spirit and purpose of the commercial landscape ordinance of the city. Such conditions, limitations or requirements shall remain in full force and effect thereafter so long as the special exception status is continued and any violation of such conditions, limitations and requirements shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
(c)  Appeals from board to or review by city commission. 
(1)  All appeals or reviews of the action of the zoning board, whether with respect to the denial of a special exception application or the approval of the special exception application, shall be as provided for in section 42-284. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued for work or improvements pursuant to such special exception until after the grant of such special exception has become final. 
(3)  The grant or denial of such application for special exception shall become final upon: 
a.  The latest to occur of the times set for filing appeal or moving for review, if no appeal or review occurs; or

DIVISION 8. - TRANSIENT RENTALS 
 
Sec. 42-440. - Purpose. 
The city commission finds that transitory uses of residential property tend to adversely affect the residential character of the community and are injurious to the health of the community. Therefore, it is necessary and in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to monitor and provide reasonable means for citizens of the city to mitigate impacts created by such transitory uses of residential property within the city. It is unlawful for any owner of any property within the geographic bounds of the city, to rent or operate a transient rental contrary to the procedures and regulations established in this article or applicable state statute, except as provided in subsection 42-442(b).

("FHA") and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Section 12131 et seq.) ("ADA"). For purposes of this section, a "disabled" individual or person is an individual that qualifies as disabled and/or handicapped under the FHA and/or ADA. Any person who is disabled (or qualifying entities) may request a reasonable accommodation with respect to the City's land use or zoning laws, rules, policies, practices and/or procedures as provided by the FHA and the ADA pursuant to the procedures set out in this section.

The reasonable accommodation request form shall contain such questions and requests for information as are necessary for processing the reasonable accommodation request. The reasonable accommodation request form shall be substantially in the form set forth herein. 
(c)  Should the information provided by the disabled individual to the city include medical information or records, including records indicating the medical condition, diagnosis or medical history of the disabled individual, such individual may, at the time of submitting such medical information, request that the city, to the extent allowed by law, treat such medical information as confidential information of the disabled individual. The city shall thereafter endeavor to provide written notice to the disabled individual, and/or their representative, of any request received by the city for disclosure of the medical information or documentation which the disabled individual has previously requested, be treated as confidential by the city. The city will cooperate with the disabled individual, to the extent allowed by law, in actions initiated by such individual to oppose the disclosure of such medical information or documentation, but the city shall have no obligation to initiate, prosecute or pursue any such action, or to incur any legal or other expenses (whether by retention of outside counselor allocation of internal resources) in connection therewith, and may comply with any judicial order without prior notice to the disabled individual. 
(d)  The city administrator shall have the authority to consider and act on requests for reasonable accommodation, after notice and public hearing to receive comments, input and information from the public (provided, however, the city administrator or designee shall not be required to render their decision at said public hearing).

(1)  Grant the accommodation request; 
(2)  Grant a portion of the request and deny a portion of the request, and/or impose conditions upon the grant of the request; or 
(3)  Deny the request, in accordance with applicable law.

In the event a request for additional information is made, the 45-day period to issue a written determination shall no longer be applicable, and the city administrator shall issue a written determination within 30 days after receipt of the additional information. If the requesting party fails to provide the requested additional information within said 15-day period, the city administrator shall issue and written notice advising that the requesting party had failed to timely submit the additional information, and therefore the request for reasonable accommodation shall be deemed abandoned and/or withdrawn and no further action by the city with regard to said reasonable accommodation request shall be required. 
(e)  In determining whether the reasonable accommodation request shall be granted or denied, the requesting party shall be required to establish that they are protected under the FHA and/or ADA by demonstrating that they are a disabled person.

Sec. 77-3. - General findings. 
It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that: 
(a)  Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2(b), Florida Constitution, and F.S. §§ 166.021 and 166.041, the city has all powers of local self-government to perform municipal functions and render municipal services except when prohibited by law, and such power may be exercised by the enactment of legislation in the form of city ordinances. 
(b)  The city commission may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary power for a municipal purpose except when expressly prohibited by law, and the city commission may legislate on any subject matter on which the Florida Legislature may act, except those subjects described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of F.S. § 166.021(3). The subject matter of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of F.S. § 166.021(3), are not relevant to the imposition of stormwater assessments by the city. 
(c)  The purpose of this article is to: 
(1)  Provide procedures and standards for the imposition of stormwater assessments under the constitutional and statutory power of the city; 
(2)  Authorize a procedure for the funding of stormwater management services, facilities, or programs provided to properties within the stormwater service area; and 
(3)  Legislatively determine the special benefit provided to assessed property from the stormwater utility. 
(d)  The Florida Legislature has mandated that local governments in the State of Florida, including the city, have the responsibility for developing mutually compatible stormwater management programs consistent with the rules and regulations of the state department of environmental protection, the Federal Clean Water Act, and the water management districts and the stormwater management programs established and maintained by other local governments. 
(e)  The stormwater assessments imposed hereby are consistent with the authority granted in F.S. § 403.0893. That statutory provision is additional and supplemental authority to the constitutional and statutory power of self-government granted to a municipality.

DIVISION 2. - STORMWATER UTILITY 
 
Sec. 77-21. - Stormwater utility. 
There is hereby established a stormwater utility, which shall be the operational means of implementing and otherwise carrying out the functional requirements of the city's stormwater management system to construct or acquire stormwater improvements and provide stormwater management services. The stormwater utility shall provide: 
(a)  Administration and management services in the operation and maintenance of the city's capital facilities for stormwater management; 
(b)  The preparation of stormwater studies and the implementation of the stormwater utility; 
(c)  The regulation of stormwater basins; and 
(d)  The repair, replacement, improvement and extension, of the city's capital facilities for stormwater management. 
The stormwater utility shall place emphasis on the achievement of maximum efficiency through identifying programs and funding sources which are complementary to other regional, state, and federal programs. The city administrator shall be responsible for administration of the stormwater utility. 
(Ord. No. 2009-0884, (Art. 2.0, § 2.01), 11-10-2009)  
Sec. 77-22. - Stormwater utility fund. 
The city commission intends to fund the cost of providing services and capital facilities for stormwater management through stormwater assessments. The city commission has further concluded that periodic determination of revenues earned and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of services and capital facilities for stormwater management will enhance accountability and management control of the city's stormwater utility and will facilitate implementation of the city commission's funding policy for stormwater management. Accordingly, there shall be established a stormwater utility fund. From an accounting perspective, the stormwater utility fund shall be established as an "enterprise fund." Proceeds of the stormwater assessment shall be used for payment of the stormwater service cost, the payment of the capital cost of stormwater improvements, and the payment of debt service on obligations issued to finance stormwater improvements.

DIVISION 3. - STORMWATER ASSESSMENTS 
 
Sec. 77-31. - Legislative declarations of special benefit. 
It is hereby ascertained and declared that the stormwater utility, the stormwater management services, and the stormwater improvements provide a special benefit to the assessed property based upon the following legislative determinations: 
(a)  The stormwater utility possesses a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of all developed property by treating and controlling contaminated stormwater generated by improvements constructed on developed property, which resulted in the alteration of such property from its natural state to accommodate such improvements. 
(b)  The special benefit received by assessed property is the control, management and treatment of the stormwater burden generated by the improvements on developed property. 
(c)  Substantially all of the stormwater burden managed, controlled, and treated by the stormwater utility is generated by developed property and the amount of stormwater generated by property in its natural state that is managed, controlled, and treated by the stormwater utility is inconsequential. 
(d)  The city has adopted the infrastructure element of the comprehensive plan which sets forth goals that make it necessary and essential to construct improvements and extensions to the existing stormwater system so the collection, storage, treatment, and conveyance of stormwater within the city adequately protects the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. The creation and maintenance of the stormwater utility is designed to implement the stormwater sub-element of the infrastructure element and other municipal, federal, and state policies mandating stormwater management programs by local governments.

Sec. 77-32. - Stormwater service assessments. 
(a)  The city commission is hereby authorized to impose stormwater assessments against property located within the stormwater service area. The stormwater service cost may be assessed against developed property located within the stormwater service area at a rate of assessment based upon the special benefit accruing to such property from the stormwater management service provided by the city, measured by the number of ESUs attributable to each parcel or classification of property. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the city commission specifically determines that any portion of the stormwater service area receives a distinct special benefit from any component of the stormwater management service that is materially different in kind or degree from the special benefit received by other portions of the stormwater service area, the stormwater service cost related to such component shall be separately assessed against the portion of the stormwater service area receiving the distinct special benefit. 
(c)  The stormwater assessments shall also fund all or any portion of the capital cost or the debt service and related cost of obligations issued to finance the project cost of a stormwater improvement identified in any stormwater basin plan. Stormwater assessments to fund the capital cost or the debt service and related cost of obligations issued to finance the project cost of each stormwater improvement may be imposed against all parcels of property within the stormwater improvement area at a rate of assessment based upon the special benefit accruing to such property from the stormwater improvement, measured by the number of ESUs attributable to each parcel or classification of property. 
(d)  If stormwater assessments are imposed to fund the debt service and related cost of obligations issued to finance the project cost of a stormwater improvement, the stormwater assessment may include the amount required to fund any amounts withdrawn during the prior fiscal year from any debt service reserve account established for obligations and the amount of any principal of and interest on obligations that has become due and remains unpaid. 
(Ord. No. 2009-0884, (Art. 3.0, § 3.02), 11-10-2009)  
Sec. 77-33. - Initial assessment resolution. 
The initial proceeding for imposition of the stormwater assessments shall be the city commission's adoption of an initial assessment resolution. The initial assessment resolution shall: 
(a)  Describe the stormwater improvement or stormwater management service proposed for funding from the proceeds of the stormwater assessments and stormwater fees; 
(b)  Estimate the capital cost or stormwater service cost; 
(c)  Describe with particularity the proposed method of apportioning the capital cost or stormwater service cost among the parcels of property located within the stormwater improvement area or stormwater service area, as applicable, such that the owner of any parcel of property can objectively determine the amount of the stormwater assessments, based upon its value, use or physical characteristics; and 
(d)  Include specific legislative findings that recognize the equity provided by the apportionment methodology and specific legislative findings that recognize the special benefit provided by the stormwater improvement or stormwater management service. 
At its option, the city commission may adopt separate initial assessment resolutions for the stormwater assessment and each separate stormwater assessment.

(5)  The estimated maximum stormwater assessment to become due in the fiscal year for each parcel; and 
(6)  At the option of the city commission the stormwater assessment roll may also include the estimated maximum annual stormwater assessment to become due in any future fiscal year for each ESU (or other units used to determine the amount of the stormwater assessment) and each parcel. 
(b)  Copies of the initial assessment resolution and the preliminary stormwater assessment roll shall be on file in the office of the city clerk and open to public inspection. The foregoing shall not be construed to require that the stormwater assessment roll be in printed form if the amount of the stormwater assessment for each parcel of property can be determined by use of a computer terminal available for use by the public.

The form of such notice shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, notwithstanding that the city may use a different collection procedure in any fiscal year. The notice shall be mailed by either first class mail, or by use of the Annual Truth in Millage Notices, should the city utilize the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, at least 20 calendar days prior to the hearing to each property owner, at such address as is shown on the tax roll at the time the notices are prepared for mailing. Notice shall be deemed mailed upon delivery thereof to the possession of the U.S. Postal Service. Failure of the owner to receive such notice due to mistake or inadvertence shall not affect the validity of the stormwater assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for the payment of a stormwater assessment imposed by the city commission pursuant to this article.

Sec. 77-52. - Alternative method of collection of stormwater assessments. 
In lieu of using the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city may elect to collect the stormwater assessment by any other method which is authorized by law or under an alternative collection method provided by this section. 
(a)  The city may provide for the collection of the stormwater assessment through utility bills, mailed to all water utility users on each affected parcel of property, other than government property in the city or through an alternative billing method as may be approved by the city commission. The initial bill may, upon direction of the mayor, be accompanied by explanatory material that includes: 
(1)  A brief explanation of the stormwater assessment; 
(2)  A description of the ESU calculation used to determine the amount of the assessment; 
(3)  The number of ESUs attributed to the utility user;

(b)  The city shall have the right to record a lien for unpaid assessments in the public records of Broward County, Florida. 
(c)  The city shall have the right to appoint or retain an agent to foreclose and collect all delinquent stormwater assessments in the manner provided by law. A stormwater assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any installment is due. In the event the city exercises its rights to foreclose and collect a delinquent stormwater assessment, the city or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her stormwater assessment within 60 days from the date the stormwater assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city or its agent will initiate a foreclosure action and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent stormwater assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real estate, or otherwise as provided by law. 
(d)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as an individual person or corporation. The city may join in one foreclosure action the collection of stormwater assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent property owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent stormwater assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent stormwater assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(e)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent stormwater assessment and costs, fees, and expenses attributable thereto, may be rolled into the special assessment for such parcel in a subsequent fiscal year. 
(f)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent stormwater assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that: 
(1)  Notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by law and this article; and 
(2)  Any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent stormwater assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the stormwater assessment roll to the tax collector.

(a)  City-owned property. Unless directed otherwise by the city commission, the city will be responsible for its stormwater assessment evidence of payment for such may be by a transfer of city funds into the stormwater utility fund. 
(b)  Government property owned by a government entity other than the city. Given the minimal amount of property located in the city owned by a governmental entity other than the city, and the fact that the use of such property is typically limited to providing and facilitating services to the city and real property within it, property owned by government entities other than the city shall be exempt from the stormwater assessment.

The tax imposed herein shall not be applied against any fuel adjustment charge, and such charge shall be separately stated on the bill.

(c)  Any seller of such utility service failing to collect such tax at the time of collecting the price of such utility service, where the seller has not elected to assume and pay such tax, shall be liable to the city for the amount of such tax in like manner as if the tax had been actually paid by the purchaser thereof to the seller, and the official shall cause to be brought all suits and actions and shall take such proceedings in the name of the city as shall be necessary for the collection or recovery of such tax; provided, however, that the seller of such utility service shall not be liable for the payment of such tax upon uncollected charges.
