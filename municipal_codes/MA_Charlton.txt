ARTICLE I
Noncriminal Disposition
[Adopted as Art. XLIV of the 2005 Bylaws]
§ 10-1. Noncriminal disposition procedure.
Any person designated below as the enforcing person for a particular
bylaw, rule or regulation, or portion thereof, taking cognizance of a
violation of same which he/she is empowered to enforce, hereinafter
referred to as the "enforcing person," as an alternative to initiating
criminal proceedings may give to the offender a written notice to
appear before the Clerk of the Dudley District Court or such other
court, if any, having jurisdiction thereof at any time during office hours,
not later than twenty-one (21) days after the date of such notice. Such
notice shall be in triplicate and shall contain the name and address,
if known, of the offender, the specific offense charged, and the time
and place for his, her or its required appearance. Such notice shall be
signed by the enforcing person, and shall be signed by the offender
whenever practicable in acknowledgment that such notice has been
received. The enforcing person shall, if possible, deliver to the offender
a copy of said notice at the time and place of the violation. If it is not
possible to deliver a copy of said notice to the offender at the time
and place of the violation, said copy shall be mailed or delivered by
the enforcing person, or by his/her commanding officer or the head of
his/her department or by any person authorized by such commanding
officer, department or head, to the offender's last known address, within
fifteen (15) days after said violation. Such notice as so mailed shall be
deemed a sufficient notice, and a certificate of the person so mailing
such notice that it has been mailed in accordance with this section shall
be prima facie evidence thereof.
A.
At or before the completion of each tour of duty, or at the beginning
of the first subsequent tour of duty, the enforcing person shall give to
his/her commanding officer or department head those copies of each
notice of such a violation he/she has taken cognizance of during such
tour which have not already been delivered or mailed by him/her as
aforesaid. Said commanding officer or department head shall retain
and safely preserve one copy and shall, at a time not later than the
next court day after such delivery or mailing, deliver the other copy to
the Clerk of the Court before which the offender has been notified to
appear.
B.
As provided in MGL c. 40, § 21D (hereinafter "the statute"), any person
notified to appear before the Clerk of a District Court as hereinbefore
provided may so appear and confess the offense charged, either
personally or through a duly authorized agent or by mailing to the
Charlton Town Clerk together with the notice such specific sum of
money not exceeding three hundred dollars ($300) as the Town shall fix
as penalty for violation of the bylaw, rule or regulation. Such payment
shall, if mailed, be made only by postal note, money order or check.
C.
§ 10-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 10-1
1:21
Upon receipt of such notice, the Town Clerk shall forthwith notify the
District Court Clerk of such payment and the receipt by the District
Court Clerk of such notification shall operate as a final disposition of
the case. An appearance under the statute or this subsection shall not
be deemed to be a criminal proceeding. No person so notified to appear
before the Clerk of a District Court shall be required to report to any
probation officer, and no record of the case shall be entered in any
probation records.
D.
If any person so notified to appear desires to contest the violation
alleged in the notice to appear and also to avail himself/herself of the
procedure established pursuant to the statute and this section, he/she
may, within twenty-one (21) days after the date of the notice, request
a hearing in writing. Such hearing shall be held before a District
Court Judge, Clerk, or Assistant Clerk, as the Court shall direct, and
if the Judge, Clerk, or Assistant Clerk shall, after hearing, find that
the violation occurred and that it was committed by the person so
notified to appear, the person so notified shall be permitted to dispose
of the case by paying the specific sum of money fixed as a penalty
as aforesaid, or such lesser amount as the Judge, Clerk or Assistant
Clerk shall order, which payment shall operate as a final disposition
of the case. If the Judge, Clerk, or Assistant Clerk shall, after hearing,
find that violation alleged did not occur or was not committed by the
person notified to appear, that finding shall be entered in the docket,
which shall operate as a final disposition of the case. Proceedings held
pursuant to the statute or this subsection shall not be deemed to be
criminal proceedings. No person disposing of a case by payment of such
a penalty shall be required to report to any probation office as a result
of such violation, nor shall any record of the case be entered in the
probation records.
E.
If any person so notified to appear before the Clerk of a District Court
fails to pay the fine provided hereunder within the time specified or,
having appeared, does not confess the offense before the Clerk or pay
the sum of money fixed as a penalty after a hearing and finding as
provided in the preceding subsection, the Clerk, in accordance with the
statute, shall notify the enforcing person who issued the original notice,
who shall determine whether to apply for the issuance of a complaint
for the violation of the appropriate bylaw, rule or regulation.
F.
As used in the statute and this section, the term "District Court" shall
include, within the limits of their jurisdiction, the Municipal Court of
the City of Boston and the divisions of the Housing Court Department
of the Trial Court.
G.
The notice to appear provided for herein shall be printed in such form
as the Chief Justice of the District Courts shall prescribe for the District
Courts. Any fines imposed under the provisions of this section shall
enure to the Town for such use as the Town may direct. This procedure
shall not be used for the enforcement of municipal traffic rules and

North Charlton. Agriculture continues to be important in the area. During
its most prosperous time (1750-1840), the Village was the predominate
economic, social, and religious center in Charlton. The Worcester and
Stafford Turnpike opened through the Village in 1806. It brought additional
business to the Village. The coming of the railroad in 1829 signaled a
decline in the prosperity of business in the Northside. The typical
architecture of the District is predominately early Nineteenth Century in
date and is Federal or Greek Revival in style. All the buildings in the District
are of wood-frame construction. The Rider Tavern, a three-story structure,
is the largest domestic-type building. Most of the buildings are set back
from the roads with adjoining fields behind, and some have sheds and
barns that relate to the agricultural environment. Most of the structures
are residential. The District contains: sites of stores, schools, a tannery,
blacksmith shop, distillery, an Indian burial ground, a shoe shop, a hat
shop, a whip shop, and military training ground. The rural character of
the District exhibits a greater harmony between building groups and the
surrounding land than exists in more densely settled areas. Similarly, a
greater diversity of buildings result from the rural character, and it is
important that new construction be appropriate to its immediate
surroundings as well as the District generally.
§ 147-3. Procedures.
Any person wishing to construct, alter, repair, move, demolish or
otherwise change the exterior appearance of a natural or built feature
within the District must, before a building permit can be issued, acquire
a certificate of appropriateness from the Commission that the proposed
work is in conformance with standards for the District.
A.
In applying to the Commission for approval of the work to be
undertaken within the District, the work shall be described with
sufficient thoroughness to insure conformance with the guidelines to
facilitate the Commission with the issuance of the certificate. The
Commission may also require for existing and proposed structures
additional information about the proposed site, land use, materials,
exterior appearance, topographical plans, floor plans, building
elevations, views and a written text.
B.
Applications for certificates shall be made in triplicate, one (1) copy
being filed with the Historic District Commission, one (1) with the
Building Inspector and one (1) with the Town Clerk. Applications shall
be in the form specified by the Commission, to include plans and
elevations signed by an architect or draftsman, drawn to scale, detailed
enough to show architectural design of the structure and its relation
to the existing building, and other materials deemed necessary by the
Commission. Plot and site plans should be filed when application for
certificates are made for improvements affecting appearances, such as
walls, fences, steps and paving. In the case of demolition or removal,
the application must include a statement of the proposed condition and
appearance of the property thereafter.
C.
§ 147-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 147-3
1:97
Within fourteen (14) days of the filing of an application for any
certificate, the Commission shall determine whether the application
involves any features which are subject to approval by the Commission.
D.
If the application requires the Commission's review, or at the request
of the applicant, the Commission shall hold a public hearing, unless
waived according to the provisions of MGL c. 40C, as amended. Public
notice of the time, place and purposes of the hearing shall be given at
least fourteen (14) days in advance and the Commission must notify by
mail affected parties as provided in MGL c. 40C, as amended.
E.
The Commission shall decide upon the determination of any application
within sixty (60) days of its filing or within such further time as the
applicant may allow in writing.
F.
A certificate of appropriateness shall be issued to the applicant if the
Commission determines that the proposed construction or alteration
will be appropriate for or compatible with the preservation or
protection of the Historic District. In the case of a disapproval of an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission shall
place upon its records for such determination and shall forthwith cause
a notice of its determination, accompanied by a copy of the reasons
therefor as set forth in the records of the Commission, to be issued
to the applicant, and the Commission may make recommendations to
the applicant with respect to appropriateness of design. Prior to the
issuance of any disapproval, the Commission may notify the applicant
of its proposed action, accompanied by recommendations of changes
in the applicant's proposal which, if made, would make the application
acceptable to the Commission. If, within fourteen (14) days of the
receipt of such notice, the applicant files a written modification of
his/her application in conformity the recommended changes of the
Commission, the Commission shall issue a certificate of
appropriateness to the applicant.
G.
Upon request, the Commission may issue a certificate of nonapplicability
to any applicant whose request does not require
Commission approval.
H.
If an application is deemed inappropriate or if application is made
for a certificate of hardship, the Commission may issue a certificate
of hardship if conditions especially affecting the building or structure
involved, but not affecting the historic district generally, would make
failure to approve an application involve a substantial hardship,
financial or otherwise, to the applicant, and approval would not involve
substantial detriment to the public welfare. A certificate of hardship
shall also be issued in the event that the Commission does not make a
determination on an application within the time specified in § 147-5 of
this bylaw.
I.
Each certificate shall be dated and signed, and the Commission shall
keep a permanent record of its determination and of the vote of each

member participating therein, and shall file a copy or notice of
certificates and determinations of disapproval with the Town Clerk and
the Building Inspector.
An applicant may, within twenty (20) days of the decision by the
Commission, appeal to a Superior Court sitting in equity. The
Commission must pay costs only if it appears to the Court that the
Commission has acted with gross negligence, bad faith or malice.
K.
Structures may be repaired, and maintained without changing the
existing structure's current form.
A.
Structures may have those features removed which evidence shows are
not original or which are discordant with the character of the structure
or District.
B.
Structures may be altered in their current form in order to reconstruct
those features which evidence shows were original to the structure but
which were subsequently removed.
C.
Structures may be enlarged beyond their current or original form,
preserving the significant features of the original building. The
enlargement must be compatible with the existing structure in form,
roof shape, material, and construction.
D.
Structures may be transported to a site within the District, provided a
certificate of appropriateness has been obtained from the Commission.
The exception is when moving the structure would result in significantly
less damage to it, than leaving it on its existing site.
E.
Structures or sites of importance which, because of a moment in
history, be it the date of occupancy by a celebrated personage or
the happening of an event, may be altered in order to be in greater
conformity with the appearance at the moment in time.
F.
Structures of importance because of their date of construction may be
altered to restore features of their original appearance. If the structure
has been altered at some later time and that alteration is appropriate
to the character of the building and the District, or is notable in its own
right, that alteration can be retained.
G.
Structures which are architecturally important as unique constructions
or as exceptionally fine examples of their period, region or style should
be altered only so as to conform more closely to their original or
most characteristic appearance. In such cases, the original appearance
must be determined through convincing documentation provided by the
applicant.
H.
Structures which are typical of their age and style, but are not unique
or architecturally significant, may be altered in order to be in greater

convincing evidence.
The applicant is responsible for providing the Commission with
sufficient evidence and documentation to establish historical accuracy
of the proposed changes.
J.
A visual feature is discordant if, in the opinion of the Commission, it
is of a color, shape, form, or texture or detail that is untypical of the
District; or if it employs a typical color, shape, form, texture or detail
in ways that are uncharacteristic of the District; or if through its use or
visual appearance it presents a strong and incongruent contrast with
its surroundings.
A.
Structures which are discordant to the character of the District or
contain land uses which are not compatible may not be expanded. They
may be altered to be in greater conformity with the visual character of
the District and may be altered or screened so that their discordance is
visually less apparent.
B.
New structures shall conform to the typical styles of the District, being
similar in the following ways:
(1) The proportion and quantity of openings in the facade.
(2) The materials of construction.
(3) Roof slopes and shapes.
(4) Architectural details.
(5) Plan organization.
(6) Landscaping and vegetation.

§ 155-8. Continued compliance.
The Police Chief shall periodically check with the Executive Office of Public
Safety and Security ("EOPSS"), which has issued an Informational Bulletin
which explains the requirements for Town bylaws and the procedures for
obtaining criminal history information, to see if there have been any
updates to be sure the Town remains in compliance.
§ 155-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 155-9
1:107
§ 155-9. Procedure.
Upon receipt of the fingerprints and the appropriate fee, the Police
Department shall transmit the fingerprints it has obtained pursuant
to this bylaw to the Identification Section of the Massachusetts State
Police, the Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice Information
Services (DCJIS), and/or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or
the successors of such agencies as may be necessary for the purpose
of conducting fingerprint-based state and national criminal records
background checks of license applicants specified in this bylaw.
A.
The Town authorizes the Massachusetts State Police, the
Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice Information Systems
(DCJIS), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and their
successors, as may be applicable, to conduct fingerprint-based state
and national criminal record background checks, including of FBI
records, consistent with this bylaw.
B.
The Town authorizes the Police Department to receive and utilize state
and FBI records in connection with such background checks, consistent
with this bylaw.
C.
The state and FBI criminal history will not be disseminated to
unauthorized entities.
D.
Upon receipt of a report from the FBI or other appropriate criminal
justice agency, a record subject may request and receive a copy of his/
her criminal history record from the Police Department. Should the
record subject seek to amend or correct his/her record, he/she must
take appropriate action to correct said record, which action currently
includes contacting the Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice
Information Services (DCJIS) for a state record or the FBI for records
from other jurisdictions maintained in its file. An applicant that wants to
challenge the accuracy or completeness of the record shall be advised
that the procedures to change, correct, or update the record are set
forth in Title 28 CFR 16.34. The Police Department shall not utilize
and/or transmit the results of the fingerprint-based criminal record
background check to any licensing authority pursuant to this bylaw
until it has taken the steps detailed in this subsection. Municipal
officials should not deny an applicant the license based on information
in the record until the applicant has been afforded a reasonable time to
correct or complete the information, or has declined to do so.
E.
The Police Department shall communicate the results of fingerprintbased
criminal record background checks to the appropriate
governmental licensing authority within the Town as listed. The Police
Department shall indicate whether the applicant has been convicted of,
or is awaiting final adjudication for, a crime that bears upon his/her
suitability, or any felony or misdemeanor that involved force or threat
of force, controlled substances or a sex-related offense.

§ 155-10. Rules and regulations.
The Board of Selectmen is authorized to promulgate regulations for the
implementation of the proposed bylaw, but in doing so it is recommended
that they consult with the Chief of Police, Town Counsel, and the
Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (or its
successor agency) to ensure that such regulations are consistent with the
statute, the FBI's requirements for access to the national database, and
other applicable state laws.
§ 155-11. Use of criminal record by licensing authorities.
§ 155-12. Fees.

express or by failure of the AG to seasonably act upon a request for
approval) and upon publication, all as provided in MGL c. 40, § 32.
Licensing authorities of the Town shall utilize the results of fingerprintbased
criminal record background checks for the sole purpose of
determining the suitability of the subjects of the checks in connection
with the license applications specified in this bylaw. A Town licensing
authority may deny an application for a license on the basis of the
results of a fingerprint-based criminal record background check if it
determines that the results of the check render the subject unsuitable
for the proposed occupational activity. The licensing authority shall
consider all applicable laws, regulations and Town policies bearing on
an applicant's suitability in making this determination.
A.
The Town or any of its officers, departments, boards, committees or
other licensing authorities is hereby authorized to deny any application,
including renewals and transfers thereof, by any person who is
determined unfit for the license, as determined by the licensing
authority, due to information obtained pursuant to this bylaw.
B.
The fee charged by the Police Department for the purpose of
conducting fingerprint-based criminal record background checks shall
be $50. The Town Treasurer shall periodically consult with the
Department of Revenue Division of Local Services and/or Town Counsel
regarding the proper municipal accounting of those fees.
A.
A portion of the fee, as specified in MGL c. 6, § 172B 1/2, shall be
deposited into the Firearms Fingerprint Identity Verification Trust
Fund, and the remainder of the fee may be retained by the Town for
costs associated with the administration of the fingerprinting system.

Superintendent. Any person proposing a new discharge from any
commercial or industrial use or a new discharge in excess of one thousand
(1,000) gallons per day from any residential use, or a substantial change
in the volume or character of pollutants in an existing discharge, into the
sewage works must notify the Water/Sewer Department at least forty-five
(45) days before such proposed discharge or change. No person may break,
cut, connect to, or remove any part of the public sewer. Building sewers
shall connect to the existing connection branches unless an alternative
manner is approved by the Superintendent.

indemnify the Town from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly
be caused by the installation and connection of the building sewer.
§ 165-5. Separate building sewers required.
A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; unless otherwise approved by the Board. In cases where one
building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private
sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an
adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway, the building sewer from the front
building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered
one building sewer, if approved by the Board. The Town will not assume any
responsibility for damages caused by any such connection.

The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform
to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable
rules and regulations of the Town, or the procedures set forth in current
specifications of the ASTM and WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such
connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Special appurtenances
to prevent the backflow of wastewater may be required if deemed necessary
by the Superintendent. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved in writing by the Board or the Superintendent
before installation, denoting the grounds for such deviation.
§ 165-11. Notification and inspection of work.
The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Superintendent
at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the start of an approved installation,
unless a "Dig-Safe" number has been issued, and a second time when
the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public
sewer. The applicant shall connect all sanitary sewer discharges to the
building sewer and the connection to the public sewer shall be made under
the supervision of the Superintendent or an appointed representative. All
connections shall be made in the approved manner; no caps and/or plugs
are to be removed without explicit orders, and under the direct supervision
of the Superintendent or his/her designee, the existing septic tanks must
be pumped, crushed and filled then inspected by the Superintendent or
his/her designee before any approval can be granted. When leaching fields
are encountered, the Health Agent shall be notified. No backfilling of any
trench shall be made without the approval of the Superintendent. The
interior of the property shall be inspected by the Plumbing Inspector or
his/her designee, to assure compliance with all applicable plumbing code
requirements.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency has identified
sedimentation from land disturbance activities and polluted stormwater
runoff from land development and redevelopment as major sources of
water pollution, impacting drinking water supplies, natural habitats,
and recreational resources. Regulation of activities that result in the
disturbance of land and the creation of stormwater runoff is necessary
for the protection of the Town of Charlton water bodies and
groundwater resources, to safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of
the general public and protect the natural resources of the Town.
A.
Increased volumes of stormwater, contaminated stormwater runoff
from impervious surfaces, and soil erosion and sedimentation are major
causes of:
Impairment of water quality and decreased flow in lakes, ponds,
streams, rivers, wetlands and groundwater;
(1)
(2) Contamination of drinking water supplies;
(3) Erosion of stream channels;
(4) Alteration or destruction of aquatic and wildlife habitat;
(5) Flooding; and
Overloading or clogging of municipal catch basins and storm
drainage systems.
(6)
B.
The objectives of this bylaw are to:
(1) Protect water resources;
(2) Require practices that eliminate soil erosion and sedimentation;
Control the volume and rate of stormwater runoff resulting from
land disturbance activities in order to minimize potential impacts
of flooding;
(3)
Require practices to manage and treat stormwater runoff
generated from new development and redevelopment;

ARTICLE II
Driving Control
[Adopted 5-5-2007 ATM by Art. 20 (Art. XXXVI of the 2005 Bylaws)]
§ 185-3. Title and purpose.
§ 185-4. Operation of vehicles.
This bylaw shall be known as the "Driving Control Bylaw" and shall
further regulate driving on public Town ways and private ways open to
public travel in the Town of Charlton.
A.
The purpose of this bylaw is to encourage drivers to observe safer
practices on Town ways for the protection of the general public, and
to provide meaningful and effective enforcement mechanisms to help
achieve that purpose. Many of the substantive provisions below have
been modeled on those of 720 CMR 9.06, which regulates driving on
Commonwealth highways.
B.
Drive within marked lanes. When any roadway is divided into lanes, the
driver of a vehicle shall so drive that the vehicle shall be entirely within
a single lane, and he/she shall not move from the lane in which he/she is
driving until he/she has first ascertained if such movement can be made
with safety.
A.
Use right lane. Upon all roadways, the driver of a vehicle shall drive
in the lane nearest the right side of the roadway when said lane is
available for travel, except when overtaking another vehicle or when
preparing for a left turn.
B.
Overtaking other vehicles. The driver of any vehicle overtaking another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass at a safe distance
to the left thereof, and shall not cut in ahead of such other vehicle until
safely clear of it.
C.
Overtake only when there is a space ahead. The driver of a vehicle shall
not overtake and pass a vehicle proceeding in the same direction unless
there is sufficient clear space ahead on the right side of the roadway
to permit the overtaking to be completed without impeding the safe
operation of any vehicle ahead or without causing the driver of any
such vehicle to change his/her speed or alter his/her course, except as
provided in Subsection E immediately below.
D.
Vehicle being passed. Subject to the provisions of MGL c. 89, § 2, the
driver of a vehicle when about to be overtaken and passed by another
vehicle approaching from the rear shall give way to the right when
practicable in favor of the overtaking vehicle, on suitable and visible
signal being given by the driver of the overtaking vehicle, and shall
not increase the speed of his vehicle until completely passed by the
overtaking vehicle.
E.
§ 185-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 185-4
1:195
[Note: MGL c. 89, § 2, as of the date of adoption of this bylaw provides
as follows:10
"Except as herein otherwise provided, the driver of a vehicle passing
another vehicle traveling in the same direction shall drive a safe
distance to the left of such other vehicle; and, if the way is of sufficient
width for the two vehicles to pass, the driver of the leading one shall
not unnecessarily obstruct the other. Except when overtaking and
passing on the right is permitted, the driver of an overtaken vehicle
shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle on visible
signal and shall not increase the speed of his vehicle until completely
passed by the overtaking vehicle.
The driver of a vehicle may, if the roadway is free from obstruction and
of sufficient width for two or more lines of moving vehicles, overtake
and pass upon the right of another vehicle when the vehicle overtaken
is (a) making or about to make a left turn, (b) upon a one-way street,
or (c) upon any roadway on which traffic is restricted to one direction
of movement."]
Obstructing traffic.
No person shall drive in such a manner as to obstruct unnecessarily
the normal movement of traffic upon any street or way. Officers are
hereby authorized to require any driver who fails to comply with
this Subsection F to drive to the side of the roadway and wait until
such traffic as has been delayed has passed.
(1)
Subject to the provisions of MGL c. 89, § 11, no driver shall enter
an intersection or a marked crosswalk unless there is sufficient
space on the other side of the intersection or crosswalk and on
the right half of the roadway to accommodate the vehicle he/she
is operating without obstructing the passage of other vehicles or
pedestrians, notwithstanding any traffic control signal indication to
proceed.
(2)
F.
10.Editor's Note: This section of state law was amended by St. 2008, c. 525, §§ 8, 9, so that
the first clause now reads as follows: Except as herein otherwise provided, the driver of a
vehicle passing another vehicle traveling in the same direction shall drive a safe distance
to the left of such other vehicle and shall not return to the right until safely clear of the
overtaken vehicle."
§ 185-4 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 185-4
1:196
[Note: MGL c. 89, § 11, as of the date of adoption of this bylaw
provides as follows:
"When traffic control signals are not in place or not in operation
the driver of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way, slowing down
or stopping if need be so to yield, to a pedestrian crossing the
roadway within a crosswalk marked in accordance with standards
established by the department of highways if the pedestrian is on
that half of the traveled part of the way on which the vehicle is
traveling or if the pedestrian approaches from the opposite half of
the traveled part of the way to within 10 feet of that half of the
traveled part of the way on which said vehicle is traveling.
No driver of a vehicle shall pass any other vehicle which has
stopped at a marked crosswalk to permit a pedestrian to cross,
nor shall any such operator enter a marked crosswalk while a
pedestrian is crossing or until there is a sufficient space beyond
the crosswalk to accommodate the vehicle he is operating,
notwithstanding that a traffic control signal may indicate that
vehicles may proceed.
Whoever violates any provision of this section shall be punished by
a fine of not more than $200.
Whenever a pedestrian is injured by a motor vehicle in a marked
crosswalk, the department of state police or the municipal police
department with jurisdiction of the street, in consultation with
department of state police if deemed appropriate, shall conduct an
investigation into the cause of the injury and any violation of this
section or other law or ordinance and shall issue the appropriate
civil or criminal citation or file an application for the appropriate
criminal complaint, if any. This section shall not limit the ability of
a district attorney or the attorney general to seek an indictment
in connection with the operation of a motor vehicle which causes
injury or death and which violates this section."]
Following too closely. The driver of a vehicle shall not follow another
vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard
to the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and condition of the
way.
G.
Slow vehicles to stay two hundred (200) feet apart. Upon ways less
than twenty-seven (27) feet wide and upon which vehicular traffic is
permitted to operate in both directions, the driver of any slow-moving
commercial vehicle when traveling outside of a business or residential
district shall not follow another slow-moving commercial vehicle within
two hundred (200) feet, but this shall not be construed to prevent such
slow-moving commercial vehicle from overtaking and passing another
slow-moving commercial vehicle. The provisions of this Subsection H
shall not apply to funerals or other lawful processions.
H.
Care in starting, stopping, turning or backing, Except as otherwise
provided in 720 CMR 9.08(3), the driver of any vehicle before starting,
I.
§ 185-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 185-4
1:197
stopping, turning from a direct line, or backing shall first see that such
movement can be made in safety. If such movement cannot be made
in safety or if it interferes unduly with the normal movement or other
traffic, said driver shall wait for a more favorable opportunity to make
such a movement. If the operation of another vehicle should be affected
by a stopping or turning movement, the driver of such other vehicle
shall be given a plainly visible signal, as required by MGL c. 90, § 14B.
[Note: 720 CMR 9.08(3) as of the date of adoption of this bylaw
provides as follows:
"Backing Prohibitions. No person shall back a vehicle for the purpose
of gaining entrance to any express state highway off ramp. Exit from
the highway shall be made only at succeeding exits. No person shall
back a vehicle from any ramp which provides entrance or exit for an
express state highway."]
[Note further: MGL c. 89, § 11, as of the date of adoption of this bylaw
provides as follows:
"Every person operating a motor vehicle, before stopping said vehicle
or making any turning movement which would affect the operation of
any other vehicle, shall give a plainly visible signal by activating the
brake lights or directional lights or signal as provided on said vehicle;
and in the event electrical or mechanical signals are not operating or
not provided on the vehicle, a plainly visible signal by means of the
hand and arm shall be made. Hand and arm signals shall be made as
follows:
1. An intention to turn to the left shall be indicated by hand and arm
extended horizontally.
2. An intention to turn to the right shall be indicated by hand and arm
extended upward.
3. An intention to stop or decrease speed shall be indicated by hand
and arm extended downward.
Whoever violates any provision of this section shall be punished by a
fine of not less than twenty-five dollars for each offense."]
Obedience to traffic control signals. Colors and arrow indications in
traffic control signals shall have the commands ascribed to them in
this Subsection J, including Subsections (1) through and including (8)
below, and no other meanings, and every driver of a vehicle, railway
car or other conveyance shall comply therewith, except when otherwise
directed by an officer or by a lawful traffic regulating sign (other than
a "stop" sign), signal or device or except as provided in Subsection
X(2) below. In no case shall a driver enter or proceed through an
intersection without due regard to the safety of other persons within
the intersection, regardless of what indications may be given by traffic
control signals.
Green. While the green lens is illuminated, drivers facing the signal
may proceed through the intersection, but shall yield the right-
(1)
J.
§ 185-4 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 185-4
1:198
of-way to pedestrians and vehicles lawfully within a crosswalk or
the intersection at the time such a signal was exhibited. Drivers of
vehicles making a right or left turn shall yield the right-of-way to
pedestrians crossing with the flow of traffic.
Right, left and vertical green arrows. When a right green arrow
is illuminated, drivers facing said signal may turn right. When a
left green arrow is illuminated, drivers facing said signal may turn
left. When a vertical green arrow is illuminated, drivers facing said
signal may go straight ahead. When a green arrow is exhibited
together with a red or yellow lens, drivers may enter the
intersection to make the movement permitted by the arrow, but
shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles proceeding from another
direction on a green indication, and to pedestrians legally within a
marked crosswalk.
(2)
Yellow. While the yellow lens is illuminated, waiting drivers shall
not proceed, and any driver approaching the intersection or a
marked stop line shall stop at such point unless so close to the
intersection that a stop cannot be made in safety; provided,
however, that if a green arrow is illuminated at the same time
drivers may enter the intersection to make the movement
permitted by such arrow.
(3)
Right and left yellow arrows. When yellow arrows are illuminated,
drivers are warned that the related green movement is being
terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
(4)
Red. While the red lens is illuminated, drivers facing the signal
shall stop outside of the intersection or at such point as may
be clearly marked by a sign or line; provided, however, that if a
green arrow is illuminated at the same time drivers may enter the
intersection to make the movement permitted by such arrow.
(5)
Right and left red arrows. Vehicular traffic facing a steady red
arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to make the movement
indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to
make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering
the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication
permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow shown.
Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic
facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection
to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way
street, after stopping. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the rightof-
way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to
other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
(6)
§ 185-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 185-4
1:199
Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated by rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering
the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a stop line when
marked, and the right to proceed shall be subject to provisions of
MGL c. 89, § 8.
[Note further: MGL c. 89, § 8, as of the date of adoption of this
bylaw provides as follows:
"When two vehicles approach or enter an intersection of any ways,
as defined in section one of chapter ninety, at approximately the
same instant, the operator of the vehicle on the left shall yield the
right-of-way to the vehicle on the right. Any operator intending to
turn left, in an intersection, across the path or lane of vehicles
approaching from the opposite direction shall, before turning,
yield the right-of-way until such time as the left turn can be made
with reasonable safety. Any operator of a vehicle entering a rotary
intersection shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle already in
the intersection. The foregoing provisions of this section shall not
apply when an operator is otherwise directed by a police officer,
or by a traffic regulating sign, device or signal lawfully erected
and maintained in accordance with the provisions of section two
of chapter eighty-five and, where so required with the written
approval of the department of highways and while such approval
is in effect.
At any intersection on ways, as defined in section one of chapter
ninety, in which vehicular traffic is facing a steady red indication
in a traffic control signal, the driver of a vehicle which is stopped
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk or the near
side of the intersections or, if none, then at the entrance to the
intersection in obedience to such red or stop signal, may make
either (1) a right turn or (2) if on a one-way street may make a
left turn to another one-way street, but shall yield the right-ofway
to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the
signal at said intersection, except that a city or town, subject to
section two of chapter eighty-five, by rules, orders, ordinances, or
bylaws, and the department of highways on state highways or on
ways at their intersections with a state highway, may prohibit any
such turns against a red or stop signal at any such intersection,
and such prohibition shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof. Any person who violates
the provisions of this paragraph shall be punished by a fine of not
less than thirty-five dollars."]
(7)
Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed
through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.
(8)
K. Lane-direction-control signals.
§ 185-4 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 185-4
1:200
When lane-direction-control signals are placed over the individual
lanes of a street or highway, vehicular traffic may travel in any lane
over which a green signal is shown, but shall not enter or travel in
any lane over which a red signal is shown.
(1)
Lane control signals. When traffic control signals are located and
operated over or adjacent to the individual lanes of a street or highway
within an area designated as a lane traffic control area, vehicles shall
be operated in obedience to the command given by the signal indication
shown over or adjacent to the lane in which the vehicle is being
operated. A lane traffic control area is that portion of a way designated
by official traffic signs installed not less than one thousand (1,000) feet
in advance of lane traffic control signal installations.
L.
Obedience to isolated stop signs. Except when directed to proceed by
a police officer, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop sign or
a flashing red signal indication shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection, or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting
roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering it. After having stopped, the
driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection
or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an
immediate hazard during the time when such driver is moving across
or within the intersection or junction of roadways. This Subsection M
shall not apply when the traffic is otherwise directed by an officer or
by a lawful traffic-regulating sign, signal or device or as provided in
Subsection X(3) below.
M.
Obedience to "Yield" Signs. Every driver of a vehicle or other
conveyance approaching an intersection of ways, where there exists
facing him/her an official sign bearing the word "Yield," said sign having
been erected in accordance with the written approval of the Mass.
Highway Department to the extent legally required, and such approval

The purpose of 780 CMR 115.AA is to provide a more energy-efficient
alternative to the base energy code applicable to the relevant sections of
the Building Code for both new construction and existing buildings.
§ 195-3. Applicability.
This code applies to residential and commercial buildings. Buildings not
included in this scope shall comply with 780 CMR 13, 34, and 51, as
applicable,
§ 195-4. Authority.
A municipality seeking to ensure that construction within its boundaries is
designed and built above the energy efficiency requirements of 780 CMR
may mandate adherence to this appendix. 780 CMR 115.AA may be adopted
or rescinded by any municipality in the commonwealth in the manner
prescribed by law.
§ 195-5. Stretch Code
The Stretch Code, as codified by the Board of Building Regulations and
Standards as 780 CMR Appendix 115.AA, including any future editions,
amendments or modifications, is herein incorporated by reference into the
§ 190-16 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 195-5

3 A federally licensed amateur radio operator may be allowed to construct a communications
tower in this district, subject to a special permit issued by the Planning Board, upon
application made by following the procedure in § 200-7.1H(2) of the Charlton Zoning Bylaw.
Criteria for granting said special permit shall be based solely on that which is allowed under
MGL c. 40A, § 3. [Amended 5-21-2012 ATM by Art. 28]
Special rules.
Vehicle access to major residential developments shall be adequate
to service the traffic that such developments will generate.
Applicants for site plan approval and for special permits for such
developments shall submit a traffic and engineering study showing
the vehicle access conditions on Town of Charlton and private
streets over which vehicles must travel, on the shortest route,
to get to the development from a state highway. The study shall
identify all conditions of road surface, curvature, grade, drainage,
driver sight distance and roadway and pavement width on all such
streets. The study shall also contain an evaluation by a professional
engineer, registered in the State of Massachusetts, of the adequacy
of the streets and access to handle the estimated vehicular traffic
that will be generated with the development fully occupied.
The Planning Board, in considering an application for site plan
approval, and the Zoning Board of Appeals, in considering
such an application for a special permit, may determine that
such vehicle access to a major residential development is not
adequate, and may use that determination as a reason to
refuse to grant said site plan approval or special permit. In
making its determinations, the Planning Board and Zoning
Board of Appeals may seek the advice of other Town officials,
such as the Superintendent of Highways, Fire Chief, and Police
Chief, and may also seek advice from experts in traffic and
roadway engineering.
(a)
The Planning Board and Zoning Board of Appeals may make
their approvals of site plans and special permits, respectively,
contingent on the execution of the terms of written
agreements, voluntarily entered into between the permitissuing
authority and applicants, that bind the applicants to
remedy the substandard vehicle access conditions at their own
expense. In addition to these provisions, all requirements of
Charlton's Subdivision Regulations must be met in obtaining
site plan approval and/or a special permit.11 [Amended

NOTES:
1 An additional twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of contiguous land area is required for
each dwelling unit beyond the first dwelling unit and fifty (50) feet of additional lot frontage
plus twenty (20) feet for each dwelling unit beyond two (2). This requirement shall apply to
two-family and multifamily dwellings, but shall not apply to accessory apartments.
2 Side and rear yards shall each be at least seventy (70) feet when abutting any residential or
agricultural district.
3 In an R-SE Zone, a twenty thousand (20,000) square foot lot requires a sewer connection.
Without a sewer connection, the minimum lot size is forty thousand (40,0000 square feet.

from the front lot line. Parking lots shall be set back a minimum of twenty (20) feet from the
front lot line, or a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the front lot line if the front lot line abuts
a state-numbered route, and they shall not be located within the required side or rear yards,
nor within the required buffer area.
6 To accomplish the purposes of the Village District, the Planning Board may authorize by
special permit a reduction of front, side and rear setback standards for new or preexisting
structures. The Board must find that the required setbacks would result in, or have resulted
in, construction of structures that are not in keeping with the area's scale and character. The
Board must further find that the relaxation of said standards will not interfere or negatively
impact abutting properties, particularly property used or zoned for residential purposes.

nonconforming structure shall conform with the provisions of this
bylaw and to any proposed amendment for which first notice of the
public hearing has been published.
(1)
If a nonconforming structure devoted to a conforming use is
destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, it may be repaired or
rebuilt, provided that the restoration is commenced within twentyfour
(24) months, and completed within thirty-six (36) months of
the catastrophe, and no nonconformity with the provisions of this
bylaw is increased in degree of extent or a violation created.
Otherwise, it may be repaired or rebuilt only in conformity with the
provisions of this bylaw. [Amended 5-16-2016 ATM by Art. 20]
(2)
Any alteration of a lawfully existing nonconforming structure shall
conform with the provisions of this bylaw or to any proposed
amendment to it if the alteration is begun after the first notice

alteration will provide for the use of the structure as follows:
(a) For a substantially different purpose;
(b) For the same purpose in a substantially different manner; or
(c) For the same purpose to a substantially different degree.
(3)
Any alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change to

of the structure.
(4)
Changes in nonconforming structures devoted to nonconforming
uses shall be governed by Subsection C of this section.
(5)
Uses. Any lawful existing use of a structure or land which does not
conform to the provisions of this bylaw may continue. Any change or
substantial extension of such use shall be governed by the following:
Any change or substantial extension of a lawfully existing
nonconforming use of a structure or land shall conform with the
provisions of this bylaw and to any proposed amendment to it
for which first notice of the required public hearing has been
published. Such change or extension in an R-40 or an A District
shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the land area occupied
by the principal structure at the time such uses become
nonconforming; nor shall such change or extension cause the use
to be more nonconforming in terms of the Intensity of Use Schedule
(§ 200-3.2D). [Amended 5-15-2017 ATM by Art. 21]

use is damaged or destroyed for fire or other catastrophe, it may
be repaired or rebuilt and the use restored, provided that the
restoration is commenced within twelve (12) months and
completed within twenty-four (24) months of the catastrophe.
Otherwise, it may be repaired or rebuilt only in conformance with
the provisions of this bylaw.
(4)
Preexisting nonconforming structures or uses may be extended,
altered, or changed by special permit, provided that the Zoning
Board of Appeals finds that the extension, alteration, or change
will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing
nonconforming use of the structure. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of these bylaws, the alteration, reconstruction,
extension or structural change (collectively "alteration") of a
preexisting, nonconforming single-family or two-family residential
structure will be deemed not to increase the nonconforming nature
of such a structure, and shall be permitted as of right, if the
structure is nonconforming solely because of insufficient frontage
or lot area, or both, and the proposed change shall meet all
dimensional requirements for front setback, side and rear
setbacks, building coverage, lot coverage, maximum floors and
maximum height.

the prior written consent of the Planning Board; after a public hearing
has been held. The public hearing shall be duly advertised as per the
requirements of § 200-7.2G of this bylaw. Designation of a road as a scenic
road shall not affect the eligibility of Charlton to receive construction or
Prohibition and special permit. Not more than two (2) unregistered
motor vehicles, assembled or disassembled, shall be kept, stored or
allowed to remain on a lot except upon the grant of a special permit for
such use by the Board of Selectmen as per the Storage of Unregistered

§ 200-5.5. Historic districts.
Article 25 of the Charlton Annual Town Meeting of May 14, 1977 established
an Historic District Bylaw. With certain exceptions, as provided in Section
7 of that bylaw, no building or structure within an historic district shall
be constructed or altered in any way that affects exterior architectural

§ 200-5.6. Signs. [Amended 5-20-2013 ATM by Art. 22]
Purpose.
It is the purpose of § 200-5.6 to protect the public health, safety,
convenience and general welfare of the residents of the Town of
Charlton by regulating signs that:
(a) Obstruct traffic visibility and cause traffic hazard;
(b) Pose a danger through disrepair and threat of collapse;
Decrease property values due to incompatibility with the
property that surrounds it;
(c)
Protect the architecture, character and appearance of the
various neighborhoods in the Town;
(d)
(e) Minimize lighting impacts from signs;
(f) Disrupt the aesthetic environment of the Town of Charlton;
Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign
regulations; and
(g)
Protect and improve the public health, safety, convenience and
general welfare.
(h)
(1)
Signs constitute a separate and distinct use of the land upon which
they are placed and affect the use of adjacent streets, sidewalks
and other public places, and adjacent private places open to the
public. The unregulated construction, placement and display of
signs constitute a public nuisance detrimental to the public health,
safety, convenience and welfare of the residents of the Town.

Inspector within twenty-one (21) days of its receipt of the
application.
The Planning Board shall be the special permit granting authority
for the purposes of this section. The Board shall grant special
permits hereunder if it determines that:
The sign requested pursuant to the special permit application
is necessary due to topography or site conditions unique to its
proposed location; or
(a)
A unique and particular type of use requires additional signage
in order to identify the premises adequately.

to order the repair, alteration or removal of a sign which
constitutes a public health and/or safety problem by reason of
improper or inadequate maintenance, design, construction,
condition or dilapidation.
(6)
Purpose. The purpose of the flexible development option is to provide
for the most efficient use of services and infrastructure, to maintain the
Town's traditional New England rural character and land use patterns
and to encourage the permanent preservation of open space.
A.
Applicability. Flexible development special permits shall be permitted
on parcels of ten (10) acres or more in A, R-40, R-SE and V Districts
upon the issuance of a special permit for flexible development from the
Planning Board upon a finding that the proposed flexible development
will be superior to a conventional subdivision plan in: allowing for
greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential
developments; encouraging the permanent preservation of open space,
agricultural land, forests and woodland, historic or archaeological sites,
or other natural resources; maintaining the Town's traditional New
England rural character and land use patterns in which small villages
contrast with open spaces, farmland and forests; preserving scenic
vistas; providing for the most efficient use of municipal and other
services; preserving unique and significant natural, historical and

Every group shall be separated from every other group within any
flexible development by a distance determined by the Planning
Board.
(2)
A strip of permanently restricted open space, the width of which
shall be at the discretion of the Planning Board, shall be provided
between every group and the exterior property lines of the flexible
development parcel.

of lots or residential units within the flexible development.
[3]
(a)
The Board may also require that scenic, conservation or
historic easements be deeded to the Town or other nonprofit
organization.
(b)
(1)
The special permit shall state any restrictions on the use of the
open space. Where such land is not conveyed to the Town, it shall
be covered by a restriction, enforceable by the Town or a nonprofit
organization, running with the land, which provides that such land
shall be used only for the purposes specified in the special permit.
Such restrictions may provide easements for underground utilities
but they shall not permit wells or septic systems upon the land.
The open space may not be developed for uses accessory to the
residential use such as parking or roadways. Wherever practical,
(2)
D.
14.Editor's Note: See Ch. 210, Subdivision of Land.
§ 200-5.7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-5.7
1:283
the open space shall be contiguous to other protected open space

If the open space subject to the restrictions established by the
special permit is to be owned by a corporation or trust in
accordance with Subsection D(1)(a)[3], maintenance of the
common land shall be permanently guaranteed through the
establishment of an incorporated homeowners' association which
provides for mandatory membership by the lot or unit owners,
assessments for maintenance expenses, a general liability
insurance policy covering the open space, and a lien in favor of
the Town of Charlton in the event of the lack of maintenance. The
terms of the lien shall provide that the Town may, if it determines
that required maintenance has not been accomplished as required
by the conditions of the special permit, perform the required
maintenance and assess the members of the corporation or trust,
or the corporation or trust itself, for the cost of such maintenance.
Copies of the documents creating the corporation or trust of the
general liability insurance policy, and of the lien, shall be submitted
to the Planning Board for review and Planning Board acceptance
and shall be recorded in the Worcester District Registry of Deeds,
in the form and with content as approved by the Planning Board, as
a condition of the special permit. [Amended 5-21-2012 ATM by
Art. 28]
(3)
The open space shall not be leased, sold or used for purposes other
than those authorized by the special permit. Any proposed change
to the use of the open space shall be approved by a majority of the
Planning Board present and voting, provided that the proposed use
is consistent with the intent of this section, and it will not adversely
impact abutters and the use of surrounding open space by bright
lights, noise or other nuisances. The Board may impose conditions
on such proposed uses.
(4)
Procedure.
A pre-application meeting with the Planning Board and other
relevant boards for review and discussion of a preliminary or
conceptual plan is recommended prior to a formal submission of an
application for a special permit. Preliminary sketches of a flexible
development plan and a conventional subdivision plan are
encouraged to be submitted.
(1)
No application shall be deemed complete, nor shall any action
be taken, until all required materials have been submitted. Plans
and other submission materials conforming to the Planning Board's
adopted "Procedures for Applications for a Special Permit for
Flexible Development", as filed with the Town Clerk, shall be
submitted to the Planning Board and Town Clerk as required by
such procedures.

§ 200-5.8. Development standards for BEP Districts.
The Planning Board shall, within fifteen (15) days of submission,
distribute one (1) copy of the submission materials each to the
Conservation Commission, Board of Health, Sewer Commission,
Building Inspector, Fire Department and Board of Selectmen for
review and comment. The Planning Board shall not take final action
on the plan within thirty-five (35) days of such distribution unless
such comments are sooner received.
(3)
The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing and make its
decision in accordance with applicable provisions of MGL c. 40A,
§ 9, unless otherwise required by Massachusetts law; the Board
shall hold a public hearing within sixty-five (65) days of the filing
a complete of the application with the Town Clerk; the Board
shall file its decision with the Town Clerk within ninety (90) days
following the date of the public hearing; and the granting of a
special permit shall require a four-fifths (4/5) vote of the Planning
Board. The cost of advertising the hearing and notification of
abutters shall be borne solely by the applicant. The time limits
hereunder may be extended by written agreement between the
petitioner and the Planning Board and any such agreement shall be
filed with the Town Clerk. [Amended 5-21-2012 ATM by Art. 28]
(4)
The granting of a special permit for flexible development shall
not be construed as definitive subdivision approval under the
Subdivision Control Law. The approval of a definitive subdivision
plan showing a flexible development shall not be construed as
the granting of a special permit. However, the applicants are
encouraged to request a simultaneous public hearing for both
plans, if required.
(5)
The special permit shall not be valid until recorded in the Registry
of Deeds and no work may commence until evidence of such
recording has been received by the Planning Board and the
Building Inspector. Such recording shall be the responsibility of the
petitioner.

Definitions. The following terms shall have the following meanings for
the purposes of this section:
FLEXIBLE DEVELOPMENT — A residential development in which
single-family dwelling units are clustered together into one (1) or more

adjacent properties by permanently protected open space.
F.
Roads and utilities.
Access to the site. Vehicular access shall be only from a major
street or collector street (as defined in the Rules and Regulations
Governing the Subdivision of Land15), except where unusual
circumstances make secondary accesses from minor streets
(1)
A.
§ 200-5.7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-5.8
1:285
practicable without adverse effects on property along such minor
streets. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to
encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements
and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Left-hand
storage and right-hand turn lanes and/or traffic dividers shall be
required where existing or anticipated heavy traffic flows indicate
need.
Internal circulation. Uses within an industrial or office park shall be
served by a separate internal road system to the maximum extent
possible.
(2)
Construction standards. Site development shall be in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Rules and Regulations
Governing the Subdivision of Land regarding utilities, drainage
and roadways; roadways shall be designed to the standards for
nonresidential subdivisions in said Rules and Regulations. Upon
the written request of the applicant, the Planning Board may waive
strict compliance with such regulations where it is demonstrated
that such waiver or modification is in the public interest and is
consistent with this section, with § 210-8.1 of the Rules and
Regulations and with the Subdivision Control Law (MGL c. 41,
§ 81R).
(3)
Roadway maintenance. All internal roadways in the site that are
privately maintained may be required by the Planning Board to

record running with the land, and duly recorded at the Worcester
District Registry of Deeds to insure that the roadway will be
adequately and safely maintained. If the ways and utilities are
proposed to be accepted by the Town, the Planning Board may
require the applicant to ensure that the roadways meet all
requirements of its Rules and Regulations Governing the
Subdivision of Land or to make repairs to the facilities proposed
for acceptance, as a pre-condition to such acceptance. [Amended
5-21-2012 ATM by Art. 28]

Landscaping requirements. In addition to § 200-3.2C(2), industrial park
buffers, and § 200-3.2C(3), outside bulk storage, the following
landscaping and screening requirements shall apply. [The requirements
of § 200-4.2D(5) shall not apply to industrial and office parks.]
The front yard setback area of each lot, except for driveways and
walkways, shall be landscaped with an effective combination of
trees, ornamental trees, ground cover, shrubbery, and lawn.
(1)
Within parking lots, there shall be provided one tree for every ten
(10) spaces. A minimum of five percent (5%) of the parking lot area
having twenty-five (25) or more spaces shall be maintained with
landscaping.
(2)
Removal of healthy trees over five (5) inches in diameter at breast
height (dbh) shall be minimized along roadways to the maximum
extent practicable. Any such trees as are removed shall be
replaced. New or replacement trees must be at least two (2) inches
dbh. [Amended 5-21-2012 ATM by Art. 28]
(3)
All landscaped areas shall be properly maintained. Shrubs or trees

property owner.
(4)
B.
Lighting. Exterior illumination shall be only as necessary for safety and
lighting of buildings, walks and roads. All lighting shall be arranged and
shielded so as to prevent glare from the light source onto any public
way or any other property. No light standard shall be taller than twentyfive
(25) feet. All light standards shall be in a style approved by the
Planning Board.
C.
Utility areas. The Planning Board may require exposed storage areas,
dumpsters, machinery, service areas, utility buildings and/or other
unsightly use to be screened from view from neighboring properties
and streets through the use of berms, fences or landscaping.

§ 200-5.8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-5.8
1:287
§ 200-5.9. Special permits for adult uses.
Procedures. If new lots are created that require the approval of the
Planning Board under the Subdivision Control Law, the applicant shall
submit a definitive plan and seek approval of a subdivision.
Development on individual lots, or development of an office or
industrial park on a single lot, or on multiple lots, requires approval of
a site plan under § 200-7.1D of this Zoning Bylaw. The applicant may
submit the materials required for both applications simultaneously in
order to expedite the review process.
F.
Purpose and intent. It has been documented in numerous other towns
and cities throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and
elsewhere in the United States that adult entertainment uses are
distinguishable from other business uses and that the location of adult
entertainment uses degrades the quality of life in the areas of a
community where they are located, with impacts including increased
levels of crime, blight, and late hours of operation resulting in noise
and traffic late into the night. Therefore, this bylaw is enacted pursuant
to MGL c. 40A, §§ 9 and 9A to serve the compelling Town interests by
regulating and limiting the location of adult entertainment enterprises
as defined herein. This regulation will promote the Town of Charlton's
great interest in protecting and preserving the quality of its
neighborhoods, commercial districts, and the quality of life through
effective land use planning.
A.
General. Special permits shall be required to authorize the
establishment of adult bookstores, adult video stores, adult
paraphernalia stores, adult live entertainment establishments or adult
motion-picture theaters as hereinafter defined. Such permit shall
require specific improvements, amenities and locations of proposed
uses for which such permit may be granted. All proposals for special
permits under this section shall also require site plan review under
§ 200-7.1D of the Charlton Zoning Bylaw.
B.
Definitions. As used in this section, the following words shall have the
following meanings:
ADULT BOOKSTORE — An establishment having as a substantial or
significant portion of its stock-in-trade, books, magazines, and other
matter which are distinguished or characterized by their emphasis
on depicting, describing, or relating to sexual conduct or excitement

significant portion of its stock-in-trade, videos, movies or other film
material which is distinguished or characterized by its emphasis
depicting, describing, or relating to sexual conduct or sexual
excitement as defined in MGL c. 272, § 31. For purposes herein,
"substantial or significant portion of stock" shall mean more than
twenty-five percent (25%) of the subject establishment's inventory or
more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the subject premises' gross
floor area.
Allowable locations for adult entertainment uses:
Adult entertainment uses are allowed only within certain
boundaries within the Town's Industrial - General (IG) District,
described as follows:

No special permit shall be issued to any person convicted of
violating the provisions of MGL c. 119, § 63, or MGL c. 272,
§ 28.
(d)
Adult use special permits shall only be issued following public
hearings held within sixty-five (65) days after filing of an
application with the Charlton Planning Board, a copy of which
shall forthwith be given to the Town Clerk by the applicant.
The special permit granting authority shall act within ninety
(90) days following a public hearing for which notice has been
given by publication or posting as provided by MGL c. 40A,

if no appeal is made during the statutory appeal period, such
time as is required to pursue or await the determination of an
appeal referred to in MGL c. 40, § 17, from the grant thereof
to be excluded from the computation of such six-month period,
if a substantial use thereof has not sooner commenced except
for a good cause or, in the case of permit for construction, if
construction has not begun by such date except for good cause.
Any request for extension of the special for good cause shall
be made in writing to the Planning Board establishing such
cause before the end of the six-month period; all extensions

§ 200-5.10. Special permits for wireless telecommunication
facilities.
may be granted or denied at the sole discretion of the Charlton
Planning Board.
The granting of a special permit for adult uses shall not be
construed as approval for site plan review under § 200-7.1D of
the Charlton Zoning Bylaw. Said site plan review is required
of any proposed new adult entertainment establishment, adult
bookstore, adult video store, adult paraphernalia store, adult
motion-picture theater, and adult live entertainment
establishment. Applicants who wish to shorten the permit
timeline are encouraged to request a joint permitting process
covering both the special permit and site plan review.

entertainment establishment, adult bookstore, adult motionpicture
theater, adult paraphernalia store, or adult video store
or adult live entertainment establishment shall apply for such
permit within ninety (90) days following the adoption of this
Zoning Bylaw; along with a written request to waive the site

Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to minimize adverse
impacts of wireless communications facilities, satellite dishes and
antennas on adjacent properties and residential neighborhoods;
minimize the overall number and height of such facilities to only what
is essential; promote shared use of existing facilities to minimize the
need for new facilities; and deal effectively with aesthetic concerns and
to minimize adverse visual impacts.

No wireless communications facility may be erected except upon
the issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board and
approval under site plan review as set forth in § 200-7.1D of the
(1)
E.
§ 200-5.10 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 200-5.10
1:294
Zoning Bylaw and subject to all of the provisions of this section.
It is recommended to the applicant to undertake both the special
permit and site plan review procedures concurrently in order to
expedite the permitting process. Multiple applications for the same
site/facility are also encouraged, provided there is one (1) lead
applicant responsible for all submissions; and further provided that
no submission will be officially received until the Planning Board
is satisfied that all submission requirements for all the applicants
have been met, as described under Subsection G.
The only wireless communication facilities allowed are: (a) newly
constructed freestanding towers, and stealth communications
facilities/structures, with their associated communications devices,
and WCF accessory building(s); (b) communications devices and
WCF accessory buildings mounted on, or supported, in whole or
in part, by any existing building or structure; (c) and any WCF
located wholly within any existing building or structure. Latticestyle
towers and similar facilities that require guy wires for support
are not allowed.
(2)
All owners and operators of land used in whole or in part for
a wireless communications facility and all owners and operators
of such wireless communications facility shall, as a continuing
condition of installing, constructing, erecting and using a wireless
communications facility, permit other FCC-licenses commercial
entities seeking to operate wireless communications facility, to
install, erect, mount and use compatible wireless communications
equipment and fixtures on the equipment mounting structure on
reasonable commercial terms, provided that such co-location does
not materially interfere with the transmission and/or reception
of communication signals to or from the existing wireless
communications facility, and provided that there are no structural
or other physical limitations that make it impractical to
accommodate the proposed additional wireless communication's
equipment or fixtures.
(3)
Each proposed construction of a new WCF, tower, communications
device, stealth communications facility, or WCF accessory building
shall require an initial special permit. Any extension in the height
of, addition of WCF accessory buildings, communications devices
to, or replacement of any WCF shall require an amendment to the
special permit previously issued for that facility; or in the case
where there is no special permit, an initial special permit.
(4)
New facilities shall be considered by the Planning Board only upon
a finding by the Planning Board that: (a) the applicant has used
reasonable efforts to co-locate its proposed wireless
communications facilities on existing or approved facilities; and
(b) that the applicant either was unable to negotiate commercially
reasonable lease terms with the owner of any existing or approved
facility that could accommodate the proposed facilities from both
(5)
§ 200-5.10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-5.10
1:295
structural engineering (i.e., the height, structural integrity, weightbearing
and wind-resistant capacity of the existing or approved
facility), and radio frequent engineering (i.e., height, coverage
area, etc.) perspectives; or there neither exists nor is there
currently proposed any facility that could accommodate the
proposed facilities from structural and radio frequent engineering
perspectives. A report discussing this information, entitled "New
Wireless Communications Feasibility Study," is to be submitted to
the Planning Board as part of any special permit submission as
outlined in Subsection G(4) below.
The Town, acting through its Planning Board, may require the
applicant to pay required fees for professional peer review of the
applicant's proposal by a professional or radio frequency engineer,
attorney or other qualified professional. [Amended 5-21-2012
ATM by Art. 28]
(6)
Co-existence with other uses. A wireless communications facility
may be located on the same lot by special permit with any other
structures or uses lawfully in existence and/or lawfully undertaken
pursuant to this Bylaw.
(7)
Design requirements and performance standards. All wireless
communications facilities erected, installed and/or used shall comply
with the following design requirements and performance standards:
Shared use of towers by commercial telecommunications carriers
is required unless such shared use is shown by substantial evidence
to not be feasible.
(1)
It is presumed that the maximum allowed height of towers is one
hundred fifty (150) feet, unless the applicant demonstrates that a
greater height is essential to the proper functioning of the wireless
communications services or unless the Planning Board finds that
co-location on said tower is both practical and preferable. Stealth
facilities must meet all dimensional restrictions for buildings and
structures as required in the applicable sections of the Town of
Charlton Zoning Bylaw.
(2)
In the event that the Planning Board finds that in order to conform
to the intent and purpose of this bylaw co-location is preferable,
then towers shall be designed to accommodate the maximum
number of presently interested users which is technologically
practical. In addition, if the number of proposed users is less
than four (4), the applicant shall provide a plan showing how the
proposed tower can be expanded to accommodate up to four (4)
users. In the event that the Planning Board finds that co-location is
preferable, the applicant must agree to allow co-location pursuant
to commercially reasonable terms to additional users.
(3)
F.
§ 200-5.10 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 200-5.10
1:296
Towers shall be located a minimum of five hundred (500) feet from
an existing residential dwelling or proposed dwelling in a permitted
submission. This distance may be reduced by the Planning Board
if it finds that the visual and aesthetic impact(s) on a residential
neighborhood or dwelling would not be significantly more
detrimental by doing so.
(4)
A tower shall be set back from the property lines of the lot on which
it is located by a distance equal to the overall vertical height of the
tower and any attachments.
(5)
Clustering of several wireless communications facilities on an
individual lot may be allowed if the Planning Board finds that
the visual and aesthetic impact(s) on surrounding residential
neighborhoods or dwellings would not be significantly more
detrimental than having only a single wireless communications
facility. Such a proposal shall require three (3) additional visual
depictions of the proposed grouping of facilities as described in
Subsection G(2).
(6)
Communications devices located on a structure shall not exceed
ten (10) feet in height above the roof-line of the structure, unless
the Planning Board finds that a greater height is essential to the
proper functioning of the wireless communication services to be
provided by the applicant at such location. For structures where
it is difficult to determine the roof line, such as water tanks, the
height of the communications devices shall not exceed ten (10) feet
above the highest point of the structure.
(7)
Screening requirements. All exterior wireless communications
facilities equipment and fixtures shall be painted or otherwise
screened or colored to minimize their visibility to abutters,
adjacent streets and residential neighborhoods. Wireless
communications facilities, equipment and fixtures visible against
a building structure shall be colored to blend with such building
or structure. Wireless communications facilities, equipment and
fixtures visible against the sky or other background shall be colored
or screened to minimize visibility against such background A
different coloring scheme shall be used to blend the structure
with the landscape below and above the tree or building line.
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum
extent feasible.
(8)
Communication devices shall be situated on or attached to a
structure in such a manner that they are screened, preferably
not being visible from abutting streets. Freestanding dishes or
communications devices shall be located on the landscape in such
a manner so as to minimize visibility from abutting streets and
residences, and to limit the need to remove existing vegetation. All
equipment shall be screened, colored, molded and/or installed to
blend into the structure and/or the landscape.
(9)
§ 200-5.10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-5.10
1:297
Fencing shall be provided to control access to wireless
communications facilities and shall be compatible with the scenic
character of the Town and shall not be of razor wire. Any entry
to the proposed access road shall be gated (and locked) at the
intersection of the public way, and a key to the lock provided to the
emergency response personnel designated by the Planning Board.
(10)
Night lighting of towers shall be prohibited unless required by the
Federal Aviation Administration. Lighting shall be limited to that
needed for emergencies and/or as required by the FAA.
(11)
There shall be a minimum of one (1) parking space for each facility,
to be used in connection with the maintenance of the site, and not
be used for the permanent storage of vehicles or other equipment.
(12)
For proposed tower sites, the width, grade, and construction of the
access road shall be designed so that emergency response vehicles
can get to the tower and WCF accessory buildings, and shall be
designed to provide proper storm drainage.
(13)
Procedure for a special permit and site plan review. All applications
for wireless communications facilities, and/or communications devices
shall be made and filed on the applicable application forms for site plan
and special permit in compliance with § 200-7.1D, § 200-7.1H(2), and

requirements:
A locus plan of the site at a scale of one (1) inch equals two hundred
(200) feet (1" = 200') which shall show all property lines, zoning,
the exact location of the proposed structure(s), streets, landscape
features, residential dwellings and neighborhoods and all buildings
within five hundred (500) feet of the wireless communications
facilities.
(1)
No less than eight (8) color photographs and/or renditions to be
submitted of the proposed WCF with its tower, communications
devices, etc., showing the impact of the proposed facility on
abutting streets, adjacent property owners and residential
neighborhoods; said visuals are to be labeled with their locations.
For satellite dishes or antennas, a color photograph or rendition
illustrating the dish or antenna at the proposed locations is
required.
(2)
For new towers, and for reconstruction, alteration, or extension of
existing towers, the applicant shall arrange to either fly a balloon
of at least three (3) feet in diameter, or conduct a crane test at the
maximum height of the proposed tower at least once before the
first public hearing. The date, time and location of the test shall
be advertised by the applicant at least fourteen (14) days, but no
more than twenty-one (21) days, before the flight in a newspaper of
general circulation.

Feasibility study. For proposed new wireless communication
facilities, a feasibility study in report form is required to be
completed by the applicant's professional or radio frequency
engineer and local senior technical manager, showing
documentation of an extensive and complete search of existing
towers and WCF. The study requires answers to technical questions
such as identifying existing towers in the applicant's search ring;
coverage diagrams/percentages from available heights at these
locations; RF interference conflicts; physical capacity of towers
available in search ring and the requirements for retrofitting such
facilities; existing tower contact information and contact dates;
results of co-location efforts; proposed new tower weight/user
capacity; available height locations for co-location users; and
available ground area for WCF accessory buildings. Feasibility
study forms are available from the Planning Board.

Criteria for granting special permit.
Applications for special permits may be denied if the Planning
Board finds that the petitioner does not meet or address the
requirements of this § 200-5.10 and MGL c. 40A, § 9.
(1)
When considering an application for a wireless communication
facility, the Planning Board shall take into consideration the
proximity of the facility to residential dwellings and its impact
on these residences. New towers shall only be considered after a
finding that existing (or previously approved) towers suitable for
and available to the applicant on commercially reasonable terms
cannot accommodate the proposed use(s), taking into
consideration radio frequency engineering issues and
technological constraints.
(2)
When considering an application for a proposed communications
device to be placed on a structure, or for a proposed stealth
communications facility, the Planning Board shall take into
consideration the visual impact of the unit from the abutting
neighborhoods and street(s).
(3)
H.
Conditions. The Planning Board shall also impose, in addition to any
reasonable conditions supporting the objectives of the Zoning Bylaw,
such applicable conditions as it finds appropriate to safeguard the
neighborhood or otherwise serve the purpose of this § 200-5.10,
including, but not limited to, screening, buffering, lighting, fencing,
modification of the external appearance of the structures, limitation
upon the size, method of access or traffic features, parking, removal

or cessation of use, or other requirements. Such conditions shall be
imposed in writing with the granting of a special permit. As a minimum,
the following conditions shall apply to all grants of special permits
pursuant to this section:
Annual certification demonstrating continuing compliance with the
standards of the Federal Communications Commission, Federal
Aviation Administration and required maintenance shall be filed
with the Inspector of Buildings by the special permit holder, with
a copy received by the Planning Board no later than January 31 of
each year.
(1)
Removal of abandoned towers and facilities. Any WCF that is not
operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be
considered abandoned, and the owner of such tower and facility
shall remove same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from
the Planning Board notifying the owner of such abandonment. If
such tower or facility is not removed within said ninety (90) days,
the Planning Board may cause such tower or facility to be removed
at the owner's expense. If there are two (2) or more users of a
single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all
users cease using the tower.
(2)
For all towers, a performance bond must be issued to the Town
from a surety authorized to do business in Massachusetts and
satisfactory to the Town of Charlton, in an amount equal to the
cost of removal of any and all WCF from the premises and for
the repair of such premises and restoration to the condition that
the premises were in at the onset of the lease, said amount to be
determined at the discretion of the Planning Board by either the
applicant's engineer or professional hired by the Planning Board
at the applicant's expense. The amount of the bond shall be the
total estimate of restoration costs and anticipated fees (in today's
dollars) by the applicant's engineer, plus an annual increase of
three percent (3%) for the term of the lease. The term of the bond
shall be for the full term of any lease plus twelve (12) months. The

For all towers, an agreement must be executed whereby the user
will allow the installation of municipal communications devices
at no cost to the Town of Charlton, and which will allow other
carriers to lease space on the tower so long as such use does
not interfere with the user's use of the tower, or with any Towncontrolled
communications devices.
(4)
For all towers located on non-municipal property, a clause must
be inserted in any lease that unconditionally permits the Town
or contractors hired by the Town to enter the premises, at any
time, whereupon towers are located, if any Town-wide or Towncontrolled
telecommunications are located thereon.

A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the total units shall be
affordable in perpetuity. For the purposes of this section,
"affordable units" shall be defined as units affordable to people
or families with incomes as set by the Department of Housing
and Community Development (DHCD) for this purpose. Affordable
units shall be dispersed throughout the development and shall be
indistinguishable from market-rate units. The Charlton Housing
Authority shall be responsible for choosing purchasers or tenants,
and monitoring and ensuring the long-term affordability of the
units.
(5)
The maximum number of permitted housing units within all
permitted senior living developments in the Town of Charlton shall
be limited to a number equivalent to ten percent (10%) of all

§ 200-5.11 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 200-5.12
1:306
Purposed and intent. This section of the Charlton Zoning Bylaw is
adopted pursuant to Article 89 of the Massachusetts Constitution in
order to ensure that the issuance of building permits for new residential
construction in the Town of Charlton is consistent with the Town's
ability to provide infrastructure necessary to accommodate the new
growth. This section establishes a phased growth rate limitation
consistent with historic growth rates experienced in Charlton, as
described in the Master Plan for the Town of Charlton. The Master Plan
demonstrates that the Town is unable to provide services and facilities
at a pace equivalent to the rate of development and population growth
experienced in the Town in the past decade. The Town seeks to ensure
that growth occurs in a manner that can be supported by Town services,
particularly adequate public safety, schools, roads, water, sewer, and
human services at a level of quality expected by the citizenry and
affordable to the Town.
A.
Applicability. Beginning on the date when this section of the bylaw
was approved by Town Meeting, no building permit for a new dwelling
unit or units shall be issued unless in accordance with the schedule
set forth in this section, unless exempted pursuant to Subsection E of
this section. This section shall apply to all definitive subdivision plans,
as well as to all flexible development projects proposed pursuant to
§ 200-5.7 of this bylaw. Dwelling units shall be considered as part of
a single development, for the purposes of development scheduling, if
located either on a single parcel or contiguous parcels of land that have
been held in common ownership at any time on or subsequent to the
date of adoption of this bylaw.
B.
Zoning change protection. The protection against zoning changes as
granted by MGL c. 40A, § 6, shall, in the case of a development whose
completion has been restrained by this bylaw, be extended to the
minimum time for completion allowed under this bylaw.
C.
Development rate timetable.
Building permits for new dwelling units shall be authorized only
in accordance with the following schedule. This applies to all
definitive subdivision plans, as well as to all flexible development
projects proposed pursuant to § 200-5.7 of this bylaw, which will
result in the creation of new dwelling units.
(1)
The Planning Board shall not approve any development schedule
that would result in the issuance of building permits that exceed
the phased growth rate limitation set forth in this section of the
Charlton Zoning Bylaw.
(2)
(3) Building permits shall be issued as follows:
D.

Number of New Dwelling
Units
Percentage of Total Dwelling
Units per Year*
1 to 4 100%
5 to 10 75%
11 to 20 50%
21 to 40 25%
41 or more 20%
* Percent of new dwelling units in the development for which
building permits may be authorized per calendar year. The
yearly schedule designated above commences from the date the
Planning Board approves and signs the definitive subdivision
plan or approval for the flexible development project.
If the maximum number of building permits allowable for a
particular development in a given calendar year pursuant to the
schedule in Subsection D(3) immediately above are not actually
issued during said year, those which would have been allowed but
which did not in fact issue said year may be carried forward to the
immediately following calendar year and may be added to those
normally allotted for the project during said immediately following
year, but shall not be carried forward to any subsequent calendar
year.
(4)
Procedures.
As a condition for approval, applicants shall submit a proposed
development schedule with their application for all definitive
subdivision plans as well as for all flexible development projects
proposed pursuant to § 200-5.7 of this bylaw, that will result in the
creation of new dwelling units.
(1)
Approved development schedules shall be incorporated as part
of the decision filed with the Town Clerk in accordance with
applicable procedures for the permit sought and shall be properly
recorded at the Worcester District Registry of Deeds. One copy of
the approved development schedule shall be filed with the Building
Commissioner's Office.
(2)
E.
Exemptions. The following types of development are exempt from this
section of the Charlton Zoning Bylaw. The issuance of building permits
for these types of development are exempted from the phased growth
rate limitation in order to further the goals and objectives of the
Charlton Master Plan. In any such instance, issuance of any and all
applicable permits pursuant to the Charlton Zoning Bylaw shall be
conditioned upon the recording of a restriction enforceable by the Town
that ensures that the dwelling units shall only be used for residents as
described below.

development patterns in the existing neighborhood.
Side and rear yards shall not be reduced to less than fifty percent
(50%) of distances otherwise required.
(2)
Standards. The following design standards shall apply to a FBDP:
Types of buildings. The FBDP may consist of any combination
of structures on one (1) lot or a subdivision of land; provided,
however, that no single office buildings may be constructed unless
such single office exceeds twelve thousand (12,000) square feet in
gross floor area.
(1)
Architectural style. The architecture of all buildings is of interest
to the Planning Board, and as such the Planning Board shall

(4)
Buffer areas. A buffer area of one hundred (100) feet shall be
provided at the perimeter of the property where it abuts
residentially zoned properties, except for driveways necessary for
access and egress to and from the site. No vegetation in this
buffer area will be disturbed, destroyed or removed, except for
normal maintenance. The Planning Board may waive the buffer
requirement:
Where the land abutting the site is the subject of a permanent
restriction for conservation or recreation so long as a buffer
is established of at least fifty (50) feet in depth, which may
include such restricted land area within such buffer area
calculation; or
(a)
Where the land abutting the site is held by the Town for
conservation or recreation purposes; or

Stormwater Management Policy.
(6)
Contiguous open space. A minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) (or
less if in the opinion of the Planning Board such reduction is consistent
with the intent of this section) of the parcel shown on the development
plan shall be contiguous open space. Any proposed contiguous open
space, unless conveyed to the Town or its Conservation Commission,
shall be subject to a recorded restriction enforceable by the Town,
providing that such land shall be perpetually kept in an open state,
that it shall be preserved for exclusively agricultural, horticultural,
educational or recreational purposes, and that it shall be maintained in
a manner which will ensure its suitability for its intended purposes.
The percentage of the contiguous open space which is wetlands

or trust is utilized, ownership thereof shall pass with conveyance
of the lots or units in perpetuity. Maintenance of such open space
and facilities shall be permanently guaranteed by such corporation
or trust, which shall provide for mandatory assessments for
maintenance expenses to each lot/unit. Each such trust or
corporation shall be deemed to have assented to allow the Town
to perform maintenance of such open space and facilities, if the
trust or corporation fails to provide adequate maintenance, and
shall grant the Town an easement for this purpose. In such event,
the Town shall first provide fourteen (14) days' written notice to
the trust or corporation as to the inadequate maintenance, and, if
the trust or corporation fails to complete such maintenance, the
Town may perform it and recover from the trust or corporation the
costs of performing the maintenance and all expenses, including
attorney fees (Town Counsel otherwise), incurred in enforcing the
requirements set forth in this section, which costs and expenses
shall constitute a lien upon each of such lots/units. Each individual

property.
I.
Relation to other requirements. The submittals and permits of this
section shall be in addition to any requirements of the Subdivision
Control Law or any other provisions of this Zoning Bylaw.
J.
Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this incentive option is to increase the supply of
affordable housing in the Town of Charlton. This bylaw aims to
ensure that such housing is affordable over the long-term and
provided in accordance with the requirements of MGL c. 40B and
its implementing regulations as promulgated by the Department of
Housing and Community Development (DHCD), Charlton's Zoning
Bylaw, and the Charlton Master Plan.

B.
Applicability. Developers may exercise the affordability incentive option
for residential development projects containing at least six (6) dwelling
units in any zoning district that permits residential development by
right or by site plan approval. The option is only available to definitive
subdivision plans and is not available to projects containing fewer than
six (6) dwelling units. [Amended 5-21-2012 ATM by Art. 28]
C.
§ 200-5.15 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 200-5.15
1:314
Provision of affordable units and density bonus.
Utilizing the affordable housing incentive option will require the
granting of a special permit from the Planning Board.
(1)
Density bonus applicability. The density bonus is only available
in those areas of Charlton serviced by both municipal water and
sewer, or upon approval of both the Planning Board and the Board
of Health. [Amended 5-21-2012 ATM by Art. 28]
(2)
Density bonus formula. For projects resulting in a net increase
of six (6) or more dwelling units, the applicant has the option
of obtaining a density bonus in exchange for the provision of
affordable housing. The number of additional lots derived from the
density bonus shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the
total lots that could be created under a conventional definitive
subdivision plan design. The density bonus shall be calculated
according to the following formula:
For those residential development projects that will set aside
a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the total proposed
housing units for affordable housing, the minimum lot area per
dwelling normally required in the applicable zoning district
may be reduced by the amount necessary to permit up to two
(2) additional units for each one (1) affordable housing unit
provided.
(a)
For those residential development projects that will set aside
a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the total proposed housing
units for affordable housing, the minimum lot area per dwelling
normally required in the applicable zoning district may be
reduced by the amount necessary to permit up to one (1)
additional unit for each one (1) affordable housing unit
provided.
(b)
(3)
Fractions. If, when applying the above percentages to the total
number of units to determine the number of affordable units, the
resulting number of affordable units includes a fraction of a unit,
this fraction shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
(4)
D.
Standards. Residential projects that plan on utilizing the affordable
housing incentive option need to comply with the following standards:
Affordable units shall be dispersed throughout the project so as to
ensure a true mix of market-rate and affordable housing.
(1)
Affordable units shall conform to the general appearance of
residences in the area and/or the project. Affordable units must
contain at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the average floor area
of the market-rate units.
(2)
E.
§ 200-5.15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-5.15
1:315
All affordable housing units created under this bylaw shall be no
less accessible to public amenities, such as open space, than the
market-rate units.
(3)
The construction of the affordable units will be built (a unit is
considered "built" upon the issuance of an occupancy permit)
coincident with the development of market-rate units, but in no
event shall the development of affordable units be delayed beyond
the schedule noted below:
Market-Rate Units
(% built)
Affordable Housing Units
(% built)
Up to 30% None required
30% to 50% At least 30%
51% to 75% At least 75%
76% or more 100%
(4)
Use restrictions.
Preservation of affordability: restrictions on resale. Each affordable
unit created in accordance with this bylaw shall have the following
limitations governing its resale. The purpose of these limitations
is to preserve the long-term affordability of the unit and to ensure
its continued availability for affordable income households in
perpetuity. The resale controls shall be established through a deed
restriction, acceptable to the Massachusetts Department of
Housing and Community Development and the Charlton Planning
Board, and recorded at Worcester District Registry of Deeds or the
Land Court. Covenants and other documents necessary to ensure
compliance with this section shall be executed and, if applicable,
recorded prior to and as a condition of the issuance of any
certificate of occupancy, as the Planning Board shall deem
appropriate.
(1)
Maximum rental price. Rents for the affordable units, including
utilities, shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the targeted
annual gross household income.
(2)
Maximum sales price. Housing costs, including monthly housing
payments, principal and interest payments, and insurance, shall
not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the targeted gross household
income.
(3)
Resale prices. Subsequent resale prices shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the initial pricing of the affordable housing
unit. The resale price will be established based on a discounted
rate, which is the percentage of the median income for which the
unit was originally sold. The method of resale price calculation
shall be included as part of the deed restriction. This percentage
(4)
F.
§ 200-5.15 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 200-5.15
1:316
may be increased or decreased by up to five percent (5%) at the
time of resale, in order to assure that the target income groups'
ability to purchase will be kept in line with the unit's market
appreciation and to provide a proper return on equity to the seller.
Marketing plan. The affordable units must be rented or sold using
a plan for marketing which has been reviewed and approved by
the Planning Board (or its administrative agent). Such plan will
be consistent with any affordable housing guidelines issued by the
Planning Board. The plan shall describe marketing approaches,
selection of occupants, initial rents and sales prices for the units

H.
Landscaping.
A landscaped buffer zone, of at least the width of the required
setback, continuous except for approved driveways, shall be
established along any side of the lot with road frontage to visually
separate the building and its parking areas from the road. Trees
shall be placed at least three (3) feet from the face of the curb, and
at least two (2) feet from the sidewalk.
(1)
A landscaped buffer zone along the side and rear of each lot, of
at least the width of the required side and rear setback, shall be
provided where a proposed nonresidential use abuts a residential
use.
(2)
The buffer zones shall be planted with grass, ground cover, medium
height shrubs, and shade trees planted at least every thirty (30)
feet. The buffer zone shall include both deciduous and evergreen
shrubs and trees. Trees and shrubs at driveway intersections shall
be set back a sufficient distance from such intersections so as not
to obstruct traffic visibility. Trees shall be at least eight (8) feet tall
with a trunk caliper of at least two (2) inches.
(3)
Exposed storage areas, machinery, garbage "dumpsters," service
areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings and structures shall be
placed to the rear of buildings in visually unobtrusive locations.
Screening and landscaping shall prevent direct views of the loading
areas and their driveways from adjacent properties or from public

§ 200-5.16 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 200-5.17
1:322
The final approval of all material used within the buffer zone shall
be at the discretion of the Planning Board.
Street trees shall be planted along the edge of the parking lot
at a maximum average of thirty (30) feet on center. Parking lot
edges which abut property under a different ownership shall have a
screening wall or be planted with shrubs that obtain a height of at
least three (3) feet in three years with a maximum spacing of three
(3) feet on center.
(6)
Mechanical equipment such as HVAC units, telephone boxes, or
electrical transformers shall be integrated into the site design
through use of landscaping, berms, or fences and shall be as
unobtrusive as possible. HVAC units may be located behind roof
ridge lines so they are not visible from the front view of the
building.
(7)
Parking and access. In addition to the provisions of § 200-4.2, Off-street
parking and loading, the following provisions shall apply in the Village
District. Where this section conflicts with § 200-4.2, this section shall
govern:
Parking areas shall be located to the side and rear of the structure.
No parking area shall be designed such that parking is within
the required or authorized front yard setback. The Planning Board
may, at its discretion, allow twenty-five percent (25%) of the total
parking to be located to the front of the structure.
(1)
Recognizing that standard parking requirements may hamper
development of village-style land use and development, the
Planning Board is authorized to reduce the parking requirements
specified for the use/structure proposed up to twenty-five percent
(25%). In determining the appropriate reduction, if any, the Board
may give consideration to the hours of use of the proposed use,
hours of use of other uses/structures within the Village District,
nearby on-street spaces, the amount of "shared" parking with other
uses, the opinions of merchants, residents and municipal officials
as to the adequacy or inadequacy of parking spaces within the
specific area of the proposed use, as well as other relevant
information to assist the Board in determining the need for
additional parking for motor vehicles.
(2)
To minimize the visual impact of parking lots and promote
pedestrian use, parking lots shall occupy no more than one-third
(1/3) of the lot frontage of the proposed use, and no more than
seventy-five (75) feet in a stretch.
(3)
Parking areas shall include provisions for the parking of bicycles
in locations that are safely segregated from automobile traffic and
parking.
(4)
B.
§ 200-5.17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-5.17
1:323
A minimum of five percent (5%) landscaping and green space must
be provided for all parking areas. This area shall not include the
buffer zones, but shall include all internal landscaped islands in the
parking areas.
(5)
The number of parking spaces required for a given site may be
on another site within the district. Such off-site parking must be
established by legal documentation satisfactory to Town Counsel,
and a copy filed in the office of the Town Clerk.
(6)
Common parking areas shall be permitted for mixed-use
developments which have different hours, days and/or seasons of
peak parking demand. The Board may, in approving development
within the District, permit individual parking standards to be
reduced for separate uses where it can be demonstrated that
adequate parking will be made available on a shared basis. The
Board may require written easements or other assurances to
enforce shared parking arrangements. Where practicable, the
Planning Board may require common driveways and
interconnected parking lots in order to facilitate shared parking.
(7)
Pedestrian amenities.
Provision for safe and convenient pedestrian access shall be
incorporated into plans for new construction of buildings and
parking areas and should be designed in concert with landscaping
plans. New construction should improve pedestrian access to
buildings, sidewalks and parking areas and should be completed
with considerations of pedestrian safety, handicapped access and
visual quality.
(1)
If no public sidewalk exists across the frontage of the lot, a paved
sidewalk of at least four (4) feet in width shall be provided within
the front yard setback; and to the maximum extent possible, the
sidewalk shall be designed to create a continuous pedestrian
walkway with the abutting properties.
(2)
At a minimum, fifty percent (50%) of the walls of ground floor
spaces directly facing streets shall have transparent window and
door openings, placed at the eye level of pedestrians [between
three (3) feet and eight (8) feet above grade]. The Planning Board
may waive this standard for redevelopment if compliance would
create an economic hardship or cause undesirable changes to the
facade of the building. To allow people to see interesting things
inside buildings, fixed interior walls shall not obscure views into
the building.
(3)
Commercial and office building should include features such as
awnings, canopies, bay windows, plazas, balconies, decorative
detail, public seating, and well-designed lighting to encourage
visual interest for pedestrians.
(4)
C.
§ 200-5.17 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 200-5.17
1:324
Mixed-use projects. Ground floor space shall generally be reserved
for pedestrian-oriented retailing and services, with offices and housing
above. Second-story residential uses are encouraged, and shared
parking arrangements shall be allowed.
D.
Lighting and wiring. In addition to the requirements of § 200-5.8C, the
following requirements shall apply to the Village District:
All applications for site plan review and special permit shall include
a proposed lighting plan that meets functional security needs of the
proposed land use without adversely affecting adjacent properties
or the neighborhood. Any light used to illuminate signs, parking
areas or for any other purposes must be arranged to reflect light
away from adjacent residential properties and away from the vision
of passing motorists. The lighting plan must comply with the
following design standards:
Background spaces, such as parking lots, must be illuminated
as unobtrusively as possible to meet the functional needs of
safe circulation and protecting people and property.
Foreground spaces, such as building entrances and plaza
seating areas, must use local lighting that defines the space
without glare.
(a)
Light sources must be concealed or shielded to the maximum
extent feasible to minimize the potential for glare and
unnecessary diffusion on adjacent properties.
(b)
The style of light standards and fixtures must be consistent
with the style and character of architecture proposed on the
site.
(c)
Light levels measured twenty (20) feet beyond the property
line of the development site (adjacent to residential uses or
public rights-of-way) must not exceed one-tenth (1/10)
footcandle as a direct result of the on-site lighting.
(d)
(1)
To the extent practicable, all wiring shall be placed underground to
minimize the visual exposure of overhead wires and utility poles.
(2)
E.
Signs. The color, size, height, and landscaping of signs shall be
designed for compatibility with the local architectural motif. Permanent
signs affixed to windows that advertise a product or service are
encouraged. Such signs should have colorful and unique elements that
provide visual interest for pedestrians.
F.
Historic structures. The removal or disruption of historic, traditional
or significant uses, structures, or architectural elements shall be
minimized insofar as practicable, whether these exist on the site or on
adjacent properties. When new construction is surrounded by existing
historic buildings, building height and exterior materials shall be
harmonious with those of adjacent properties.

M.
Purpose.
Based on a March 2018 Solar Farm Report prepared at the request
of and presented to the Charlton Board of Selectmen by the
Charlton Building Inspector, the Town of Charlton currently has
20 large-scale ground-mounted solar photovoltaic energy
installations, plus an additional five in the permitting stage.
Charlton alone has over 50MW of solar power either completed,
approved or proposed.
(1)
In December 2014, the DOER released Model Zoning for the
Regulation of Solar Energy Installations. The model zoning
documents were prepared to assist Massachusetts cities and towns
in establishing reasonable standards to facilitate and regulate
development of solar energy installations. Charlton has yet to
develop zoning specific requirements as to such installations, as
(2)
A.
§ 200-5.20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-5.21
1:331
defined in § 200-2.1, other than the requirement of site plan review
in all zoning districts set forth in § 200-3.2, Use Regulation,
Subsection B6(t), and the Town has experienced exponential
growth of solar arrays. Therefore, there is an immediate, identified
need to protect the interests of the Town and its citizens by
establishing long-term zoning bylaw standards and provisions to
ensure that such uses and development will be consistent with the
Town's long-term planning interests and Master Plan. It is crucial
that the Town act now to establish a temporary moratorium on
the use of land and the construction of structures related to such
large-scale ground-mounted solar photovoltaic installations and the
issuance of building permits in connection with same.
Temporary moratorium.
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Town of Charlton
Zoning Bylaw to the contrary, no building permit may be issued
for the construction of any large-scale ground-mounted solar
photovoltaic installation until adjournment of the business portion
of the May 2019 Annual Town Meeting. The purpose of this
moratorium is to allow sufficient time to engage in a planning
process to address the effects of such structures and uses in the
Town and to enact bylaws in a manner consistent with sound
land use planning goals and objectives. To the maximum extent
legally permissible the Planning Board shall not accept any further
application for a large-scale solar photovoltaic energy system
during the aforementioned moratorium period, and were it legally
required to do so any facility proposed in such an application shall
the governed by the provisions of the Charlton Zoning Bylaw as
amended before the moratorium period (including any extensions
of same, if any) expires.
(1)
For purposes of this bylaw, "large-scale solar photovoltaic energy
system" shall be as defined in § 200-2.1 of the Charlton Zoning
Bylaws, namely, as "a solar photovoltaic system that is structurally
mounted on the ground and is not roof-mounted and has a
minimum nameplate capacity of 250 kW DC." If any provision of
this bylaw amendment shall be deemed illegal or unenforceable,
such provision shall not affect any other provision hereof, all of
which shall remain in full force and effect.

The purposes of the Floodplain Districts are to protect the public health,
safety and general welfare, to protect human life and property from the
hazards of periodic flooding, to preserve the natural flood control
characteristics, and the flood storage capacity of the floodplain, and to
preserve and maintain the groundwater table and water recharge areas
within the floodplain.
§ 200-6.2. District delineation.
§ 200-6.3. Regulations.
The Floodplain District is herein established as an overlay district.
The District includes all special flood hazard areas within the Town
of Charlton designated as Zones A and AE, on the Worcester County
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) for the administration of the National
Flood Insurance Program. The map panels of the Worcester County
FIRM that are wholly or partially within the Town of Charlton are panel

boundaries of the District may be defined by the one-hundred-year
base flood elevations shown on the FIRM and further defined by the
Worcester County Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report dated July 4,
2011. The FIRM and FIS report are incorporated herein by reference
and are on file with the Town Clerk.
A.
Within Zone A, where the one-hundred-year flood elevation is not
provided on the FIRM, the developer/applicant shall obtain existing
flood elevation data, and it shall be reviewed by the Town Inspector
of Buildings. If the Inspector of Buildings determines that the data is
sufficiently detailed and accurate, it shall be relied upon to require
compliance with this bylaw and the State Building Code. If the
determination is that the land is in the floodplain, the Inspector of
Buildings shall notify the Planning Board and the developer/applicant.
B.
The Floodplain District is established as an overlay district to all other
districts. All development in the district, including structural and
nonstructural activities, whether permitted by right or by special

or deny special permits may appeal such decisions in accordance with
the provisions of Chapter 40A of the Massachusetts General Laws.
D.
Conditions for granting. Special permits may be granted if an applicant
can show a condition peculiar to the particular case but not generally
true for similar permitted uses on other sites in the same zoning
district. The Board of Selectmen and Zoning Board of Appeals shall
deny a special permit where in its judgment a nuisance, hazard, or
congestion will be created, or for other reasons there will be substantial
harm to the neighborhood or derogation from the general purposes
and the intent of the bylaw, or that the stated district objectives or
applicable use criteria will not be satisfied.

and recommendation. The Planning Board shall submit reports to the
Zoning Board of Appeals or the Board of Selectmen within thirty-five
(35) days of the receipt of the application and supporting documents.

hearing held under this bylaw, all abutters must be notified by mail of
the hearing date and time, and notice of the hearing must be published

completed without good cause, within one (1) year from the date
granted, the special permit shall lapse. Included within the one-year
period is the time required to pursue or await the determination of an
appeal. Extensions to the special permit may be granted by the special
permit granting authority for good cause.
H.
Permits granted before zoning changes. If a special permit or a building
permit is issued before the publication of the first notice of a public
hearing of a proposed zoning amendment, but is not then utilized
by commencing construction within a six-month period and then
proceeding as expeditiously as is reasonable, the building or special
permit will lapse and a new permit will be required to conform to the
amended bylaw.

request in writing that the Board's engineering consultant prepare an
estimate of the cost of performing the various items of required work,
and submit the same to the Town agencies concerned for approval.
These estimates, as approved, will then be submitted to the Board for
use in determining the necessary penal sum of the performance bond.
J.

such hearing, and by mailing a copy of such advertisement to the
applicant and to all owners of land abutting upon the land included
in such plan as appearing on the most recent tax list.
(1)
The Board shall arrange for the publication of the notices of the
hearing. The cost of the publication shall be borne by the applicant
as part of the application fee.
(2)
L.
Final approval of definitive plan.
After the public hearing, the definitive plan will be studied by
the Board to determine its conformity with the preliminary plan,
if any, and its compliance with the design standards and other
requirements of these Rules and Regulations. After such hearing,
and after the report of the Board of Health or lapse of fortyfive
(45) days without such report, the Board shall approve; or,
if such plan does not comply with the Massachusetts Subdivision
Control Law or the Rules and Regulations of the Board or the
(1)
M.
§ 210-3.3 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 210-3.3
1:376
recommendations of the Board of Health, shall modify and approve
or shall disapprove such plan. In the event of disapproval, the
Board shall state in detail wherein the plan does not conform
to the Massachusetts Subdivision Control Law, to the Rules and
Regulations of the Board or to the recommendations of the Board of
Health and shall revoke its disapproval and approve a plan which,
as amended, conforms to the Massachusetts Subdivision Control
Law and to such Rules and Regulations or recommendations. The
Board shall file a certificate of its action with the Town Clerk, a
copy of which shall be recorded by him/her in a book kept for
the purpose, and shall send notice of such action by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, to the applicant at his/her address
stated on the application. Approval, if granted, shall be subject
to the filing of a bond or covenant or both, as herein provided.
Approval of the plan shall not be deemed to be the laying out or
acceptance by the Town of any street shown thereon.
When the Board of Health has notified the Planning Board that
it has made specific findings as to which of the lots or land in
the subdivision cannot be used for building sites without injury
to the public health, the Board shall approve the definitive plan
only on condition that no building or structure shall be built or
placed upon the areas designated without consent by such Board
of Health. Such condition shall be endorsed on the plan by the
Planning Board, specifying the lots or land to which such condition
applies. In the event approval by the Board of Health is by failure
to make a report, the Board shall note on the plan that health
approval is by failure to report.
(2)
Failure of the Board to act.
Nonresidential subdivisions. In the case of a nonresidential
subdivision where a preliminary plan has been duly submitted
and acted upon or where forty-five (45) days have elapsed since
submission of said preliminary plan, and then a definitive plan is
submitted, the failure of the Board either to take final action or to
file with the Town Clerk a certificate of such action regarding the
definitive plan submitted by an applicant within ninety (90) days
after such submission, or such further time as may be agreed upon
at the written request of the applicant, shall be deemed to be an
approval thereof. Notice of such extension of time shall be filed
forthwith by the Board with the Town Clerk.
(1)
Residential subdivisions.
Preliminary plan submitted. In the case of a subdivision
showing lots in a residential zone, where a preliminary plan
has been acted upon by the Board or where at least fortyfive
(45) days have elapsed since submission of the preliminary
plan, an applicant may file a definitive plan. The failure of the
Board either to take final action or to file with the Town Clerk
(a)
(2)
N.
§ 210-3.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-3.3
1:377
a certificate of such action on the definitive plan within ninety
(90) days after such submission, or such further time as may
be agreed upon at the written request of the applicant, shall be
deemed to be an approval thereof. Notice of such extension of
time shall be filed forthwith by the Board with the Town Clerk.
No preliminary plan submitted. In the case of a subdivision
showing lots in a residential zone, where no preliminary plan
has been submitted and acted upon or where forty-five (45)
days have not elapsed since submission of such preliminary
plan, and a definitive plan is submitted, the failure of the
Board either to take final action or to file with the Town Clerk
a certificate of such action regarding the definitive plan
submitted by an applicant within one hundred thirty-five (135)
days after such submission, or such further time as may be
agreed upon at the written request of the applicant, shall be
deemed to be an approval thereof. Notice of such extension of
time shall be filed forthwith by the Board with the Town Clerk.
(b)
Performance guarantee.
Before endorsement of the approved definitive plan of a
subdivision, the applicant shall file with the Board a performance
guarantee, in a form satisfactory to the Board, for the completion
of the required improvements specified in Section 5 of these Rules
and Regulations for all lots in the subdivision, the construction
of ways and the installation of municipal services to be secured
by one (1), or in part by one (1) and in part by another, of the
following methods, which method or combination of methods may
be selected and from time to time varied by the applicant:
By a surety company performance bond (Form E) or a
performance bond (Form F) secured by a deposit of money or
negotiable securities, and conditioned on the completion of all
required improvements or any part of the improvements not
covered by a covenant, referred to in the following Subsection
O(1)(b) of these Rules and Regulations, within two (2) years
of the date of the bond, or within such shorter time as is
specified by the Board. This bond shall be in sufficient penal
sum, in the opinion of the Board, to cover the cost of such
improvements and so drawn as to insure their satisfactory
completion. The bond shall be executed by the applicant as
principal and a surety company authorized to do business in
the Commonwealth and satisfactory to the Board as surety,
or secured by the deposit with the Town Treasurer of cash
or negotiable securities in an amount equal to the penal sum
of the bond. It shall be approved as to form and manner of
execution by the Town Counsel.
(a)
By a covenant (Form G) running with the land, executed and
duly recorded by the owner of record of all the land in the
(b)
(1)
O.
§ 210-3.3 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 210-3.3
1:378
subdivision, whereby all improvements not covered by bond
in Subsection A(1)(a) of this section of these Rules and
Regulations shall be provided to serve adequately any lot in
the subdivision before such lot may be built upon or conveyed
other than by mortgage deed as provided by statute.
By delivery to the Board of an agreement executed after the
recording of a first mortgage covering the premises shown on
the plan or a portion thereof given as security for advances to
be made to the applicant by the lender, which agreement shall
be executed by the applicant and the lender and shall provide
for the retention by the lender of funds sufficient in the opinion
of the Board and otherwise due the applicant, to secure the
construction of ways and the installation of municipal services.
Said agreement shall also provide for a schedule of
disbursements which may be made to the applicant upon
completion of various stages of the work, and shall further
provide that in the event the work is not completed within
the time set forth by the applicant, any funds remaining
undisbursed shall be available for completion.
(c)
Any covenant or agreement given hereunder and any condition
required by the Board of Health as to the approval of the plan
shall be either inscribed on the plan or contained in a separate
document, referred to on the plan.
(2)
If the applicant secures performance by a covenant, but wishes to
postpone the completion of specified items of work on the ground
until after lots have been sold and/or buildings erected, the Board
may, in its discretion, exempt from the provisions of the covenant
the items of work to be so deferred, provided a bond is filed in
accordance with the procedure set forth in Subsection O(1)(a) of
these Rules and Regulations sufficient in penal sum, in the opinion
of the Board, to cover the cost of the deferred improvements.
(3)
Reduction of bound or surety. The penal sum of any such bond, or the
amount of any deposit held under Subsection O(1)(a) hereof, may from
time to time be reduced by the Board and the obligations of the parties
thereto released by the Board in whole or in part. If release is by reason
of covenant, a new plan of the portion to be subject to the covenant may
be required.
P.
Endorsement and recording.
If the plan has been approved, and before endorsement of said
plan, the applicant shall obtain and deliver to the Board, or a
designated representative thereof, a Mylar of each of the sheets
comprising the plan. In the case of registered land, when the
required work to be performed in the subdivision is to be secured
by a covenant, the applicant shall furnish in addition to the above
prints one (1) extra Mylar of each of the sheets of the definitive
(1)
Q.
§ 210-3.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-3.3
1:379
plan comprising the lot layout plan. Also in the case of registered
land when the required work to be performed in the subdivision is
to be secured by a bond, the applicant need only furnish one (1)
print Mylar of each of the sheets of the definitive plan comprising
the lot layout plan.
Approval of the plan, if granted, shall be attested on the original
tracing and the transparent cloth prints of the definitive plan by
the signatures of the majority of the members of the Board, but not
until the statutory twenty-day appeal period has elapsed following
the filing of the certificate of the action of the Board with the Town
Clerk and said Clerk has notified the Board that no appeal has
been filed. Before the definitive plan shall have been endorsed by
the Board, the owner(s) of the subdivision shall be the owner(s) of
record. After the definitive plan has been endorsed, the applicant
shall furnish the Board with three (3) prints thereof.
(2)
The definitive plan shall be stamped as follows:
"It is agreed that this approval of the Charlton Planning Board is
for [two (2) years only or for such shorter time, specified herein, as
is determined by the Board]. In the event the ways and municipal
services shown on this Plan are not constructed and installed, as
applicable, within [two (2) years from this date, or such shorter
time, specified herein, as is determined by the Board] approval of
the Board is withdrawn, and this Plan is and shall be null and void."
(3)
After endorsement by the Board and before the recording of the
approved plan, the applicant shall obtain and deliver to the Board
nine (9) paper prints, black line on white ground, of said plan for
the Board's files and for subsequent distribution to appropriate
Town agencies.
(4)
If not otherwise taken care of, as provided for under Paragraph 7
of the application for approval of definitive plan (Form C), within
thirty (30) days after the return of the approved definitive plan
the applicant shall cause to be recorded in the Worcester District
Registry of Deeds, and, in the case of registered land, with the
recorder of the Land Court, a copy of said plan and the covenant,
if any, and shall notify the Board or its Clerk of such recording,
submitting evidence thereof satisfactory to the Board.
(5)
Upon receipt of notification of recording, the Board shall file one
(1) copy of the definitive plan with the Building Inspector.
In accordance with the statute, if performance of the construction
of ways and the installation of municipal services is secured by a
covenant, the Inspector shall issue no permit for the construction
of a building on any lot within the subdivision except upon receipt
from the Board of a copy of the certificate of performance
describing the lot in question, as provided in Subsection S hereof.
(6)
§ 210-3.3 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 210-3.3
1:380
If performance of the construction of ways and the installation of
municipal services is secured by a bond, the bituminous concrete
base satisfactory to the Town Engineer (or, if none, to the Board)
shall be constructed from an existing street to a proposed
structure, and a hydrant shall be in working condition satisfactory
to the Fire Chief within five hundred (500) feet of a lot before a
house number or building permit can be issued for a structure.
Failure to comply with the procedural and other requirements
of these Rules and Regulations may result in rescission of the
approval given hereunder by the Board.
(7)
Evidence of satisfactory performance. Before the Board will release the
interest of the Town in a surety bond or deposit, or agreement, or, in
the case of a covenant, issue a release of covenant, the applicant shall
obtain and submit to the Board written evidence that the required work
on the ground has been completed to the satisfaction of the agency and
for the facilities listed below:
The Town Engineer (or, if none, the Board), for grading, grades
of all gravity utilities, storm drainage facilities, roadways, street
signs, sidewalks, grass plots, slopes, monuments, and cleaning up.
Before the Town Engineer (or, if none, the Board) shall furnish
written evidence, as noted above, the subdivider shall obtain and
submit to said engineer (or, if none, to the Board):
A registered professional engineer's certificate of (partial)
completion (Form H); and
(a)
A complete plan and profiles drawn on tracing cloth, prepared

(5)
Release of performance guarantee.
Upon the completion of the construction of ways and the
installation of municipal services and other improvements required
under Section 5 hereof in accordance with these Rules and
Regulations, security for the performance of which was given by
bond, deposit, covenant or agreement, or upon the performance
of any covenant with respect to any lot or groups of lots, the
applicant shall send by registered or certified mail to the Town
Clerk and the Board a written statement in duplicate that the
construction of ways and the installation of municipal services and
other improvements, in connection with which such bond, deposit,
covenant or agreement has been given, has been completed in
accordance with the requirements of these Rules and Regulations,
such statement to contain the address of the applicant.
(1)
The Town Clerk shall forthwith furnish a copy of said statement
to the Board. The request to the Board or statement to the Town
Clerk, as the case may be, shall include and be accompanied by a
properly executed certificate of completion (Form H).
(2)
If the Board determines that said construction, installation and
improvements have been completed to its satisfaction, it shall
release the interest of the Town in such bond and return the
bond or the deposit to the person who furnished the same, or
release the covenant by appropriate instrument (Form K or K-1),
which may be recorded, or terminate its interest in the agreement
by an instrument satisfactory in form to itself and to the lender.
The Board shall file duplicate copies of said instrument with the
Building Inspector and with the Town Engineer, if any. However,
a sum in an amount to be established by the Board, but in no
event less than twenty percent (20%) of the market value of the
subdivided land shall be held by the Town for the maintenance and
repair of streets, ways, municipal services and other improvements
for a minimum of eighteen (18) months after completion of
construction or until the streets and ways are accepted by the Town
as public ways, whichever comes first, after which date the Town
shall return the remainder of the sums thus retained to the person
or persons who furnished same.
(3)
If the Board determines that said construction, installation or
improvements have not been completed, it shall specify in a notice
sent by registered or certified mail to the applicant and to the Town
Clerk, the details wherein said construction or installation fails to
comply with the requirements of these Rules and Regulations. If
the Board fails to prepare and mail this notice within forty-five
(45) days after receipt of the statement by the Town Clerk all
obligations under the bond shall cease and terminate by operation
(4)
S.
§ 210-3.3 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 210-3.3
1:382
of law, any deposit shall be returned and any such covenant shall
become void. In the event that said forty-five-day period expires
without such specification, or without the release and return of
the bond or return of the deposit or release of the covenant as
aforesaid, the Town Clerk shall issue a certificate to such effect,
duly acknowledged, which may be recorded.
Criteria for satisfactory partial completion.
When only a portion of the streets and other improvements shown
on the definitive plan have been constructed or installed and a
release of covenant is requested, the Board shall consider as
satisfactorily completed only such lengths and parts thereof as
will (in and of themselves) form convenient and adequate systems
without the necessity of further extension or improvement, and
shall consider as eligible for release only such lots as front on, are
connected to, or are otherwise served by such streets, utilities and
other improvements.
(1)
Work on the ground adjacent to a particular lot will normally be
considered by the Board as work necessary to serve adequately
such lot, regardless of the degree to which the lot is dependent on
said work for its access or utility service. In any case, the Board will
not issue a release of covenant for the entire subdivision, or for the
final lot or group of lots therein where progressive improvements
are made, until all items of required work on the ground are
completed, regardless of location.
(2)
T.
Conveyance of utilities and easements to the Town. Before the Board
will release the interest of the Town in a performance bond or deposit
or agreement or, in the case of approval with covenant, issue a release
of covenant, the applicant shall, upon request of the Board therefor,
convey to the Town, without cost, in a form satisfactory to the Board
(Form I), valid unencumbered title to any water mains and
appurtenances, and sewers, and prescribed easements therefor. (See
Paragraph 8 of Application for Approval of Definitive Plan, Form C.) The
applicant shall also remit to the Town Treasurer, promptly upon request
therefor, a sum sufficient in the estimation of the Board to reimburse
the Town for all deed recording, title search, attorney fees and related
expenses incident to such conveyance.
U.
Failure of performance. Any bond hereunder may be enforced and any
deposit hereunder may be applied by the Board for the benefit of the
Town as provided in MGL c. 41, § 81Y, upon failure of the performance
for which any such bond or deposit was given to the extent of the
reasonable cost to the Town of completing such construction of ways
and installation of municipal services and other improvements.
V.
Streets and ways. Approval of the definitive plan does not constitute the
laying out or acceptance by the Town of streets within a subdivision as
public ways.

SECTION 4
Design Standards
§ 210-4.1. Streets.
General system and location.
All streets in the subdivision shall be designed so that, in the
opinion of the Board, they will provide safe travel for vehicles and
pedestrians. Minor streets, particularly, shall be so located and
designed that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Due
consideration shall also be given to the attractiveness of the street
layout in order to obtain the maximum livability and amenity of
the subdivision. Proposed streets shall be designed to afford safe
access to abutting lots and existing streets, including consideration
of traffic factors, such as vision at corners, sight clearance, sight
lines, existing obstructions, width of existing streets and similar
considerations.
(1)
The proposed streets shall conform to any Master or Study Plan
adopted in whole or in part by the Board.
(2)
Streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing streets,
as far as practicable, and shall comprise a convenient system with
connections adequate to insure free circulation of vehicular traffic.
(3)
Streets in the subdivision shall connect to and be accessible from
a public way or an existing private way open to the public and in
which the applicant has rights for purposes for which ways are
intended and commonly used.
(4)
There shall be provided at least two (2) recognized means of
vehicular access, as noted above, for each subdivision except one
(1) comprising only one (1) dead-end street. In the case of an
approved definitive subdivision plan under development, the Board
will not release a surety bond or deposit, or, in the case of a
covenant, issue a release of covenant for a portion or section of
the subdivision under development unless there is provided and
constructed first, except for a dead-end street, two (2) means of
vehicular access to said portion or section.
(5)
Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with other
streets already existing and named shall bear the names of existing
streets. The names of all proposed streets shall be subject to the
approval of the Board.
(6)
If adjoining property is not subdivided but is, in the opinion of the
Board, suitable for ultimate development, provision shall be made
for proper projection of streets into such property by continuing
appropriate streets within the subdivision to the exterior boundary
thereof.
(7)
A.
§ 210-4.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-4.1
1:385
Temporary dead-end streets, laid out to permit future projection,
shall conform to the provisions of alignment, width, and grade that
would be applicable to such streets if extended.
(8)
Reserve strips prohibiting access to streets or adjoining property
shall not be permitted except where, in the opinion of the Board,
such strips shall be in the public interest.
(9)
Adequate stopping sight distance shall be provided at all proposed
internal subdivision and proposed/existing roadway intersections
in accordance with the most recent AASHTO standards. A
minimum design speed of thirty (30) miles per hour shall be utilized
for calculating stopping sight distance within the proposed
subdivision roadways. At intersections of proposed and existing
roadways, field measurements of existing stopping sight distance
shall be made in the presence of the Planning Board or its
designated agent.
(10)
Alignment. All reverse curves on major and collector streets shall be
separated by a tangent at least one hundred (100) feet long.
B.
Intersections.
Streets shall be located to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than
sixty (60) degrees.
(1)
Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two (2)
streets shall be avoided. Where this proves impossible, in the
opinion of the Board, such intersections shall be designed with
extreme care for both pedestrian and vehicular safety.
(2)
Streets entering opposite sides of another street shall be laid out
either directly opposite each other, or with a minimum offset of one
hundred twenty-five (125) feet between their center lines, unless,
in the opinion of the Board, this requirement necessitates the
division of land into substantially fewer lots than would otherwise
be the case.
(3)
Street lines and property lines at all street intersections shall be
rounded with a corner having a radius of not less than twenty (20)
feet. However, when the intersection of two (2) ways varies more
than ten (10) degrees from a right angle, the radius of the curve
at the acute angle may be less and at the obtuse angle shall be
greater than twenty (20) feet to the extent approved or required by
the Board.
(4)
C.
Width.
The Board will give due regard to the prospective character of
different subdivisions, whether open residence, dense residence,
business or industrial, nature of terrain and the prospective
(1)
D.
§ 210-4.1 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 210-4.1
1:386
amount and type of travel upon various streets and footpaths
therein. Subject to adjustment in light of such factors, streets
shown on subdivision plans shall be classified as major, collector or
minor streets.
COLLECTOR STREET — A street intercepting one (1) or more
streets and which, in the opinion of the Board, is used to carry
a substantial volume of traffic from such streets to a major or
collector street or community facility, or which includes a principal
entrance street to a large subdivision or group of subdivisions.
FLEXIBLE DEVELOPMENT MINOR STREET — A street, which, in
the opinion of the Board, is being used or will be used primarily
to provide access to abutting lots in a flexible development in
accordance with § 200-5.7 of the Zoning Bylaw, and which is not
intended for use by through traffic.
MAJOR STREET — A street which, in the opinion of the Board, is
being used or will be used as a thoroughfare within the Town of
Charlton or which otherwise carries or will carry a heavy volume of
traffic.
MINOR STREET — A street which, in the opinion of the Board, is
being used or will be used primarily to provide access to abutting
lots, and which is not intended for use by through traffic.
The minimum width of street rights-of-way shall be as follows:
(a) Minor streets: sixty (60) feet.
(b) Collector streets: sixty (60) feet.
(c) Major streets: sixty-six (66) feet.
(d) Flexible development minor streets: forty (40) feet.
(2)
Alleys with a minimum width of thirty (30) feet may be required
by the Board at the rear of any lots designated or zoned for
commercial use.
(3)
All streets serving an industrial or commercial subdivision shall be
a minimum sixty-six (66) feet width.
(4)
The Board may require greater minimum widths as to streets
shown on subdivision plans, when in its opinion the additional
width is essential to safe and orderly travel upon such streets,
in light of projected short-term and long-term traffic conditions
thereon.
(5)
Grade.
Grades of all streets shall be the reasonable minimum, but shall not
be less than three-fourths percent (0.75%).
(1)
(2) The maximum center-line grades shall be as follows:
E.
§ 210-4.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-4.1
1:387
(a) Minor streets: ten percent (10%).
(b) Collector streets: eight percent (8%).
(c) Major streets: six percent (6%).
All changes in grade exceeding three-fourths percent (0.75%) shall
be connected by vertical curves of sufficient length to afford a
minimum sight distance two hundred (200) feet or more if deemed
appropriate in the opinion of the Board. The minimum design rate
of vertical curvature (k) shall be 19 for crest curves and 37 for sag
vertical curves.
(3)
On any street at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area
shall be provided having not greater than three-fourths percent
(0.75%) grade for a distance of twenty-five (25) feet measured from
the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
(4)
Dead-end streets.
Dead-end streets, designed as permanent culs-de-sac, shall not
exceed five hundred (500) feet in length unless, in the opinion of
the Board, a greater length is necessitated by topography or other
local conditions. This requirement shall not apply to culs-de-sac
located within flexible development, where the maximum length
shall be determined by the Board. The Board may also allow deadend
streets to exceed five hundred (500) feet in length, up to a
length of one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet, for the purpose
of allowing a dead-end street as roadway for a Business Enterprise
Park (BEP) development.
(1)
Such culs-de-sac shall be provided at the closed end with a
turnaround having an outside street line diameter of at least one
hundred twenty (120) feet, and a property line diameter of at
least one hundred forty-six (146) feet. However, in a flexible
development in accordance with § 200-5.7 of the Zoning Bylaw, the
turnaround may have an outside street line diameter of at least one
hundred (100) feet, and a property line diameter of at least one
hundred twenty (120) feet.
(2)
Such culs-de-sac shall not provide access to more than ten (10) lots,
unless such cul-de-sac is located within a flexible development.
Culs-de-sac within flexible development shall not provide access to
more than fifteen (15) lots.
(3)
F.
Street design standards. Minor and collector streets shall conform to
the following design standards. Major streets shall conform to the
standards of the Mass DOT, if applicable, and shall otherwise conform
to the standards set forth below.

NOTE: The Board may, at its discretion, also require an increase in
right-of-way widths by up to ten (10) feet to allow construction of
ample walkways and to preserve natural features. Also, see Appendix
A for cross-section details for the four (4) types of roadways (minor,
major, flexible and collector).
§ 210-4.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-4.2
1:389
§ 210-4.3. Lots.
§ 210-4.4. Open spaces.
Before approval of a plan, the Board may also require the plan to show a
park or parks suitably located for playground or recreation purposes or for
providing light and air. The park or parks shall not be unreasonable in area
Where water and sewer mains, storm drains or other utility installations
require, in the opinion of the Board, a location outside of any street
line, there shall be reserved, and shown on the plan, easements to
accommodate such utilities having a minimum width of twenty (20)
feet.
A.
Where a subdivision is traversed by watercourses, drainageways,
channels or streams, the Board may require that stormwater easements
or drainage rights-of-way may be reserved conforming substantially
with the lines of such watercourses, drainageways, channels or
streams, and having such further width as it deems necessary.
B.
Where the side slopes hereinafter required will extend outside of the
street right-of-way lines, suitable slope easements shall be provided of
sufficient dimensions to accommodate all portions of the slope above or
below the finished grade of abutting lots.
C.
The plan and each lot set forth thereon shall comply in all respects with
the provisions of the Zoning Bylaw of the Town of Charlton, including,
but not limited to, all such provisions relating to size, shape, width, and
frontage of lots within a subdivision.
A.
Land subdivided into lots shall be of such general character that it can
be used for building purposes without danger to health.
B.
Two-thirds (2/3) of the minimum lot area of every building lot must be
free from wetlands as defined in the Massachusetts Wetland Protection
Act as most recently revised and free also from other conditions which
in the opinion of the Board make building or construction thereon
impossible or hazardous.
C.
No lot within the Town shall be divided so as to create a lot which
does not conform with the minimum area, frontage, width and depth
requirements of the Charlton Zoning Bylaw,22 and no property line shall
be redrawn so as to create such a lot.
D.
Not more than one (1) building designed or available for use for
dwelling purposes shall be erected or placed or converted to use as
such on any lot in a subdivision nor shall any parcel or lot of land
contain more than one (1) unit designed for commercial, industrial,
warehouse, communications, transportation, public utility, or other
business uses in the Town without the consent of the Planning Board.
E.
22.Editor's Note: See Ch. 200, Zoning.
§ 210-4.2 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 210-4.4
1:390
in relation to the area of the land being subdivided and to the prospective
uses of such land. As to plans setting forth six (6) or more lots, however,
any such park shall contain a minimum of one (1) full acre, plus additional
land equal to one-tenth (1/10) of the land area, in aggregate, of all lots
depicted on the plan. Should the Board require such park or parks, it shall
by appropriate endorsement (See MGL c. 41, § 81U.) on the plan require
that no building may be erected on such park or parks for a period of not
more than three (3) years without its approval.
§ 210-4.5. Protection of natural features.
Due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as large trees,
watercourses, scenic points, historic spots, stone walls and similar
community assets, which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to
the subdivision.
§ 210-4.6. Bikeways and walkways.
Public bikeways or pedestrian walkways may be required by the Board
to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, parks, shopping,
transportation, open space and/or community facilities or for such other
reason as the Board may determine. These may or may not be part of normal
sidewalk provision, but they shall not be a part of any lot in the subdivision.
§ 210-4.7. EPA NPDES regulations.
When applicable, all subdivisions shall comply with the current EPA NPDES
Phase II regulations. If the proposed subdivision would disturb more than
one (1) acre of land, a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) will
be required to be submitted by the applicant to the EPA.

SECTION 5
Required Improvements
§ 210-5.1. General.
§ 210-5.2. Streets.
All improvements hereinafter specified shall be constructed or installed
by the applicant in accordance with these Rules and Regulations, in
conformity with the approved definitive plan and the specifications
and other requirements of the Town agencies concerned, and to the
satisfaction of such agencies.
A.
The applicant shall also provide all necessary materials except for such
materials, if any, as the Town agrees to furnish, which shall at all times
remain the property of the Town. The Town will only furnish materials
when the applicant is required to construct or install improvements
which, in the opinion of the Town agencies concerned, have a capacity
substantially greater than necessary to serve the subdivision alone, in
which case the value of the materials furnished by the Town will not
exceed the cost of providing the extra capacity.
B.
In addition to notifying, under § 210-3.3I of these Rules and
Regulations, all Town agencies concerned of the commencement and
completion of various items of work, the applicant or subdivider shall
keep them informed at all times of the progress of the work, and shall
provide continuously safe and convenient access to all parts of the work
for inspection by the Town agencies concerned or by such persons as
they may designate for that purpose. No work will be approved that
has been covered before such inspection. In addition, the subdivider
shall arrange for inspections of the work by the appropriate agencies
hereunder at each significant construction stage as specified in Form
L hereof. The subdivider shall request each inspection at least fortyeight
(48) hours prior to the requested inspection date and time. The
representative of each inspecting agency shall set forth on Form L the
date of inspection and approval, and shall also file thereafter with the
agency and with the Board a copy of Form L, together with any report
or other documentation generated by the inspection.
C.
The subdivider shall provide for tests of materials by independent
laboratories, at his/her own expense, when requested to do so by the
Town agencies concerned, and shall provide copies of the test results to
said Town agencies.
D.
Grading.
The entire area within the exterior street lines shall be cleared,
excavated or filled as necessary, and graded in accordance with the
then-standard specifications of the Town Engineer (or, if none, of
the Board).
(1)
A.
§ 210-5.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-5.2
1:393
All roadways, all areas between the roadway and sidewalk lines
and curblines, and all slopes outside exterior street lines shall be
constructed to finished transverse grades parallel to those shown
on the then-current standard cross-section plans of the Town
Engineer (or, if none, of the Board) as specified on the definitive
subdivision plan. Any deviation necessitated by unusual
topographic conditions must have the specific approval of the Town
Engineer (or, if none, of the Board).
(2)
Subgrade. The subgrade surface, fifteen and one-half (15 1/2)
inches below the finished surface grade in all streets, shall be
prepared true to the location and grades and cross sections given
and rolled with not less than a ten-ton roller. All soft or spongy
material below the subgrade shall be removed and replaced with
gravel borrow conforming to MassDOT spec. M 1.02.0 Type a
containing no stones over six (6) inches in diameter.
M 1.03.0 Sieve Designation Percent Passing
Type a 6 inches 100%
1/2 inches 50% to 80%
No. 4 40% to 75%
No. 50 8% to 28%
No. 200 0% to 10%
(3)
Gravel subbase.
The gravel subbase shall be spread in one (1) layer. The layer
shall be twelve (12) inches in depth compacted measurement
and shall conform to MassDOT spec. M 1.03 Type b with no
stone larger than three (3) inches. Gravel shall be compacted
to not less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the maximum dry
density of the material as determined by the Modified AASHTO
Compaction Test Method at optimum moisture content.
(a)
The subgrade and subbase shall contain no loam, soft yielding
material, clay, organic or other unsuitable material. All
unsuitable material shall be removed and replaced with
compacted gravel conforming with the above specifications.
(b)
(4)
Over the top layer of the gravel subbase shall be laid in two (2)
separate courses a base course of Class I bituminous concrete Type
I-1 and a surface course of Class I Type I-1 both in accordance
with Section 460 of the state standards specified above or of any
successor publication. The finished surface must be level and even
and is to form and close, even union around all curbs and projecting
frames. It is the subdivider's responsibility to see that all manhole
frames, gate boxes and catch basin frames are at street grade and
accessible for their intended use. The depth of each course shall
be:

Collector streets 3" 1 1/2"
Major streets 3" 1 1/2"
The roadway area within the frontage of a lot shall have all utilities
and the bituminous concrete base installed and approved by the
appropriate agency before said lot can be released or built upon.
(6)
Before application of the finish coat, the bituminous concrete base
shall have been in place for a minimum of twelve (12) months or for
a lesser period as may be determined by the Board.
(7)
Immediately before application of the finish coat, the bituminous
concrete base shall be swept clean and a tack coat applied
mechanically (by truck or trailer with spreader bar), evenly, and at
application rates in accordance with MassDOT.
(8)
Underground structures and facilities.
All storm drains, sewers, water mains, related installations, and
service connections to be placed within the exterior lines of a street
shall be installed, and approved as herein required, and all gas
pipes and other underground utilities shall be installed prior to
completion of the roadway foundation.
(1)
All electric, telephone, cable television, and other utility
installations, including wiring, shall be placed underground in all
subdivisions. All such utilities serving a subdivision must be
installed underground, starting at the point where a subdivision
road intersects with an existing public way or other subdivision
road, and must be placed within the required right-of-way for the
subdivision roadway.
(2)
Conduit (including wiring) fire alarm and terminal boxes with
appurtenances as required shall be installed for the fire alarm
system in accordance with the standard specifications of the Fire
Department.
(3)
All installations shall be to the specifications of the utility company
concerned and of the Town of Charlton.
(4)
The subdivider shall be responsible for all trenching, backfilling,
and paving for the installation of the necessary appurtenances for
streetlighting.
(5)
An as-built (supplementary) plan showing the locations of all
underground wiring, transformers, poles and streetlighting
(including type of fixture and lumens) shall be submitted to the
(6)
B.
§ 210-5.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-5.2
1:395
Planning Board before the definitive plan of the subdivision has
been recorded in the Registry of Deeds, or, as applicable, with the
recorder of the Land Court.
Definitive plan approval shall be subject to said plans being
approved by the concerned utility company and the Planning
Board. No installation of any utilities shall commence until the
Town has received and approved said plans.
(7)
New electric streetlighting and light standards approved by the
Board shall be installed at each intersection of streets (including
cul-de-sac) and/or ways.
(8)
Streetlighting will be consistent with the neighborhood and
surroundings and the safety of the traveling public. The subdivider
will be responsible for all trenching, backfilling and paving in
connection with the installation of all necessary cables for
streetlighting. The developer will be required to provide, at his/her
expense, underground conduits for police and fire communications.
(9)
Roadways.
Roadways shall be constructed for the full length of all streets
shown on the plan. The center lines of such roadways shall coincide
with the center line of the street rights-of-way unless a minor
variance is specifically authorized by the Town Engineer (or, if
none, by the Board).
The minimum width of roadways, between curblines, shall be
as follows:
[1] Minor streets: twenty-eight (28) feet.
[2] Collector streets: thirty-five (35) feet.
[3] Major streets: forty-five (45) feet.
(a)
The minimum outside diameter of roadways within permanent
turnarounds shall be one hundred twenty (120) feet.
(b)
Greater width, and/or greater outside diameter of roadways
within permanent turnarounds, shall be required by the Board
when deemed necessary for present and future vehicular
travel.
(c)
(1)
Where a temporary dead-end street extends one hundred fifty (150)
feet or more beyond an intersection, there shall be constructed as
part of the roadway a temporary cul-de-sac extending across the
full width of the street right-of-way, and having a minimum length
of fifty (50) feet.
(2)
Sloping at roadway intersections shall conform to the Town Bylaw
on Vision Clearance, if any.
(3)
C.
§ 210-5.2 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 210-5.2
1:396
Dwelling unit access. Dwelling units shall not be given direct driveway
access to major streets, except: (a) where existing lots of record abut
on major streets; (b) in subdivisions which front on an existing major
street; and (c) in special instances where the configuration of the tract
prevents the construction of an access road or an interior roadway,
after review and approval by the Board and by the Highway
Department of the Town of Charlton.
Minor streets shall not connect two (2) or more major streets, or
a major street and a collector street. Residential streets which
connect higher-order streets often become shortcuts, thereby
increasing the traffic load on purely residential streets and
endangering the health and safety of pedestrians and residents
thereon.
(1)
Subdivisions containing ten (10) or more lots shall provide a
minimum of two (2) means of vehicular access to and from the
subdivision onto previously existing public ways.
(2)
The Board may disapprove a plan where it determines that
dangerous traffic conditions may result due to inadequacy of the
proposed access or of the proposed ways within the subdivision
or of any of the ways adjacent to or providing access to the
subdivision.
(3)
Alternatively, where the street system within a subdivision does
not connect with or have, in the opinion of the Board, adequate
access from a public way, the Board may require, as a condition of
approval of a plan, that such adequate access by provided by the
subdivider, and/or that the subdivider make physical improvements
to and within such a way of access, in accordance with these Rules
and Regulations and the recommendations of the Board, from the
boundary of the subdivision to a public way. All costs of any such
improvements or construction shall be done by the subdivider.
(4)
Where the physical condition or width of a public way from which
a subdivision has its access is considered by the Board to be
inadequate to carry the traffic expected to be generated by such
subdivision, the Board may require the subdivider to dedicate a
strip of land for the purpose of widening the abutting public way
to a width at least commensurate with that required within the
subdivision, and to make physical improvements to and within such
public way to the same standards required within the subdivision.
Any such dedication of land for the purpose of way and any such
work performed within such public way shall be made only with
permission of the governmental agency having jurisdiction over
such way, and all costs of any such widening or construction shall
be borne by the subdivider.
(5)
D.
Curbs. In all subdivisions, curbing shall be installed along the gutter
line of both sides in all streets. The curbing shall be standard granite,
E.
§ 210-5.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-5.2
1:397
sloped granite, or precast reinforced concrete, or asphalt berm, as
designated by the Board. On all curbs having a radius of eighty-five
(85) feet or less at the street line, the gutter line shall be curbed
with circular granite curbing, or, with Board approval, circular precast
reinforced concrete curbing, cut to fit the curve. On all curbs having a
radius of more than eighty-five (85) feet, up to and including a radius
of one hundred fifty (150) feet, the gutter line shall be curbed with
straight sections of granite curbing or, with Board approval, precast
reinforced concrete curbing, not more than six (6) feet long. The ends
of each curve shall be extended by a straight section of granite curbing,
or, with Board approval, precast reinforced concrete curbing, not less

§ 220-4.2. Life insurance.
The Town shall contribute seventy-five percent (75%) to a basic life
insurance plan for all eligible employees as at present.
§ 220-4.3. Health insurance.
The Town shall contribute eighty percent (80%) towards a major indemnity
insurance plan or an equivalent amount to other group health insurance, as
specified by the Town. See MGL c. 32B, § 3.
§ 220-4.4. Holidays.
The benefits set forth below shall be provided to eligible Town
employees as such employees are defined in § 220-5.1 of this bylaw.
A.
Benefits for eligible employees will be administered in the following
manner:
New employees have thirty (30) days to enroll in their choice of
benefits. Benefits, such as health and life insurance, are prepaid
by the employee. Therefore, the employee choosing to enroll must
authorize payroll deductions so as to be effective upon hire date
and coverage will become effective thirty (30) days from hire date.
If the employee elects the coverage to start sooner, that employee
must authorize sufficient deductions from the first paycheck to
cover the entire prepayment cost. Coverage can begin as early as
the employee's hire date. Any employee that elects to start their
insurance later than thirty (30) days following the initial hire date
will require a qualifying event to enroll outside the allotted time
and during an open enrollment period if any such is applicable to
participation in a particular benefit.
(1)
Existing eligible employees have the opportunity every year at
open enrollment in April/May to make changes to their benefit
elections in coverage to be effective the following July 1. Changes
are also possible, but limited, when there is a qualifying event,
allowing thirty (30) days from the date of the event to elect the
changes. Adjusted payroll deductions may be needed to cover the
cost of changes to benefit coverage.
(2)

§ 220-4.6. Sick leave.
The vacation year is the twelve-month period from July 1 through June
30 each year, except after the completion of the six-month probationary
period. The length of continuous service is determined by the number of
years of service which the employee has completed as of July 1 of each
year. An employee who, as of July 1 of a given year, has not reached
the five-year increments of continuous service required in Subsection
A so as to qualify for a greater vacation entitlement, but who does
reach such increment during the course of such year, will be entitled
to the additional vacation time provided by such increment as of the
anniversary of such employee's benefit eligibility date. [Amended
10-27-2009 STM by Art. 12]
B.
For the purpose of vacation time, a "week" shall consist of the average
number of scheduled hours worked by the employee on a regular
basis, not to exceed a maximum of forty (40) hours. [For example,
an employee working forty (40) hours or more per week shall receive
forty (40) hours' pay for each vacation week. An employee working
twenty (20) hours per week shall receive twenty (20) hours' pay for
each vacation week.)
C.
Computation of required continuous employment with the Town for
vacation leave benefits shall include both part- and full-time
employment as an eligible employee as defined in Article 5, § 220-5.1.
D.
A maximum of one (1) week of vacation may be carried over to a
succeeding year when requested by an employee prior to June 30 and
when approved by the Town Administrator.
E.
All eligible employees of the Town shall earn one and a quarter (1.25)
paid sick days per month.
A.
A sick day shall be equal to the average number of hours the employee
is regularly scheduled to work per day. Unused sick days may be carried
over to the succeeding fiscal year or years, but shall not be accumulated
for a total of more than one hundred fifty (150) days.
B.
All eligible employees with five (5) or more years of service with the
Town of Charlton shall receive full payment for accumulated sick leave
not to exceed forty-five (45) days upon retirement at the employee's
regular hourly rate. Any employee who is eligible to receive payment
for unused sick days shall (if possible) notify the Town six (6) months
prior to retirement. Upon death of an employee, payment shall be
made to the employee's beneficiary as stipulated on the employee's life
insurance policy provided by the Town of Charlton.
C.
Sick time may be used for the employee's illness or the employee's care
of the employee's spouse, significant other, child or any member of the

in writing to the Department Head stating the reason the leave of absence
is being requested and the beginning and ending dates. The Department
Head will submit the request with his/her recommendations to the Town
Administrator. The Town Administrator will submit a written decision to the
Department Head. The employee shall receive a written response from the
Department Head stating the decision. Either party may appeal the decision
to the Board of Selectmen.
§ 220-4.8. Bereavement leave.

15]
All eligible full- and part-time employees shall be granted up to four (4)
scheduled working days as bereavement leave with pay.
A.
Bereavement leave shall be granted for the death of any following
family members: spouse, significant other, child, father or mother,
stepfather, stepmother, loco parentis, brother or sister, stepbrother,
stepsister, grandparent, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law,
sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law or stepchild, whether or not
such relative resides in the employee's household, or any person living
in the employee's household.
B.
For other relatives, a maximum one (1) day of paid leave of absence will
be granted. Special or unusual situations (such as the need for extra
time for travel) will be considered on an individual basis by the Town
Administrator. Employees granted such bereavement leave extension
may be required to use accrued vacation leave or personal leave.
C.
The Family and Medical Leave Act.
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides an entitlement
of up to twelve (12) weeks of job-protected, unpaid leave to eligible
employees. The employer must grant an eligible employee FMLA
for the following reasons:
Birth and care of the employee's child, or placement for
adoption or foster care of a child with the employee;
(a)
Care of an immediate family member (spouse, child, parent)
who has a serious health condition; or
(b)
(1)
A.
§ 220-4.6 CHARLTON BYLAWS § 220-4.9
1:422
(c) Care of the employee's own serious health condition.
If an employee was receiving group health benefits when leave
began, the Town of Charlton will maintain them at the same level
and in the same manner during periods of FMLA leave as if the
employee had continued to work. The Town may elect or require
the use of any accrued paid leave (vacation, sick, personal, etc.) for
periods of unpaid FMLA leave.
(2)
Employees may take FMLA leave in blocks of time less than the full
twelve (12) weeks on an intermittent or reduced leave basis when
medically necessary. Taking intermittent leave for the placement,
adoption, or foster care of a child is subject to the Town's approval.
Intermittent leave taken for the birth and care of a child is also
subject to the Town's approval except for pregnancy-related leave
that would be leave for a serious health condition. Approved FMLA
leave for maternity shall run concurrent with the Maternity Leave
Act.
(3)
When the need for leave is foreseeable, an employee must give the
Department Head at least thirty (30) days' written notice, or as
much notice as is practicable. When the leave is not foreseeable,
the employee must provide such notice as soon as possible.
(4)
The Town may require medical certification of a serious health
condition from the employee's health care provider. An employer
may also require periodic reports during the period of leave of
the employee's status and intent to return to work, as well as
"fitness-for-duty" certification upon return to work in appropriate
situations.
(5)
An employee who returns from FMLA leave is entitled to be
restored to the same or an equivalent job (defined as one with
equivalent pay, benefits, responsibilities, etc.). The employee is not
entitled to accrue benefits during periods of unpaid FMLA leave,
but the employer must return him/her to employment with the
same benefits at the same levels as existed when leave began.
(6)
An "eligible employee" is an employee who has been employed by
the Town for at least twelve (12) months, and has been employed
for at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours of service
during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the
commencement of the leave.
(7)
The Small Necessities Leave Act.
The Small Necessities Leave Act permits an employee leave for the
following purposes:
To participate in school activities directly related to the
educational advancement of a son or daughter of the employee,
(a)
(1)
B.
§ 220-4.9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 220-4.9
1:423
§ 220-4.10. Maternity leave.
such as a parent-teacher conference or interviewing for a new
school;
To accompany a son or daughter of the employee to routine
medical or dental appointments, such as check-ups or
vaccinations; and
(b)
To accompany an elderly relative of the employee to routine
medical or dental appointments or appointments for other
professional services relating to the elder's care, such as
interviewing at nursing or group homes.
(c)
The twenty-four (24) hours of leave available under this benefit are
in addition to the twelve (12) weeks of leave provided for under the
Federal Family and Medical Leave Act. The twenty-four (24) hours
may be taken within the twelve-month calendar year period and the
time may be taken on an intermittent [i.e., two (2) hours to attend
a parent-teacher conference] or reduced-time schedule.
(2)
An employee is required to provide his/her department with seven
(7) days' written notice of the need for the leave if the leave is
foreseeable. If the necessity for the leave is not foreseeable, the
employee is required to provide notice of the leave as soon as
practicable.
(3)
The law provides for an unpaid leave of absence. An employee may
elect to use any available accrued vacation, personal or sick leave
benefits, provided the use of such time is in accordance with the
employee's appropriate collective bargaining agreement.
(4)
A Department Head may require that written certification or
documentation support a request for leave under this Act.
(5)
An "eligible employee" is an employee who has been employed by
the Town for at least twelve (12) months, and has been employed
for at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours of service
during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the

(6)
Maternity leave shall be granted in accordance with MGL c. 149,
§ 105D (Massachusetts Maternity Leave Act). This section is intended
simply to describe the provision of MGL c. 149, § 105D, as they existed
when this became effective.
A.
An eligible employee who has worked for at least three (3) consecutive
months as a full-time employee and who gives written notice, if
possible, at least two (2) weeks advance to her Department Head of her
anticipated date of departure and her anticipated date of return, shall
be allowed maternity leave of eight (8) weeks for the purpose of giving
birth or for adopting a child under three (3) years of age. If an employee

has accrued sick leave or vacation time at the commencement of her
maternity leave, she may use such leave and/or vacation time for which
she may be eligible. Maternity leave shall be without pay. All maternity
leave shall run concurrent with Family Medical Leave Act and Small
Necessities Act where applicable.
Military leave, or its equivalent, shall be granted to any employee upon
submission of satisfactory documentation in accordance with applicable
state and federal law.
A.
Any employee, upon proper notice, may take an unpaid military leave
of absence to perform service in the uniformed services. The military
leave of absence may be involuntary or voluntary. The employee retains
the right to return to his/her former position upon return from active
duty. Health insurance will be provided at the same contribution level
for the first thirty (30) days of military leave after which the employee
may elect to continue participation by paying one hundred two percent
(102%) of the monthly premium. If the employee does not participate,
he/she has the right to join the health insurance group immediately
upon return from military leave. Military leave is limited to five (5)
years of cumulative service during employment with the Town of
Charlton. Employees considering military leave should consult USERRA
regulations as well as applicable state and federal laws for additional
rights and requirements.
B.
Jury duty/witness leave shall be granted in accordance with MGL c.
234A.
A.
An employee summoned for jury duty shall receive from the Town the
difference between the compensation of the employee received for such
jury service and the regular wages the employee would have earned for
the day, exclusive of any travel or other allowance, upon submission of
satisfactory documentation.
B.
An employee summoned by the Town, as a witness on behalf of the
Town, shall be granted leave with pay for the time lost from the
employee's regular work schedule.

year with no loss in pay (part-time employees on a pro-rated basis).
Personal days will not be allowed to accumulate year to year.

§ 220-4.15. Longevity. [Added 10-16-2017 STM by Art. 8]
Personal days shall be available to new eligible employees but only after
completion of six (6) months of work for the Town.
B.
As of every July 1 following completion of the applicable minimum
number of years of continuous service set forth below any eligible
employee covered under this bylaw and still employed by the Town
shall be eligible for an annual longevity payment (not added to the base
salary) according to the terms set forth below:
10 years but less than 15 years $200 per year
15 years but less than 20 years $400 per year
20 years but less than 25 years $600 per year
25 years or more $1,000 per year
A.
Such increases shall not be cumulative. Rather, for example, an
employee having completed fifteen (15) years' continuous service shall
receive a total, additional four hundred dollars ($400) per year [rather
than two hundred dollars ($200) plus four hundred dollars ($400)]
until the July 1 following completion of twenty (20) years' continuous
service, at which point the employee would receive a total additional six
hundred dollars ($600) per year [not four hundred dollars ($400) plus
six hundred dollars ($600)].
