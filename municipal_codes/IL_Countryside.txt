BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COUNTRYSIDE, ILLINOIS:
SECTION 1: That, the City of Countryside has a Non-Harassment Policy section as part of its
ADMINISTRATIVE POLICES. The Non-Harassment Policy section is hereby amended in part by adding the
following to the end of paragraph 2; and which shall be and read as follows:
… All City officials, City agents, City employees and City offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any
person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof.
SECTION 2: The Non-Harassment Policy section is hereby amended in part by adding the following new
Paragraph 5; and which shall be and read as follows:
Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
· Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or
gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about
other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
· Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive
bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking” or “kissing” noises.
· Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or websites.
· Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act
or actual assault.
· Textual/Electronic: “sexting” (electronically sending messages with sexual content, including pictures
and video), the use of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant
messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine. On the other end of the
spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a “reasonable
person.”
SECTION 3: The Non-Harassment Policy section is hereby amended in part by adding the following new
paragraph 7; and which shall be and read as follows:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to City of Countryside policies,
employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any
person who violates this policy or the Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be
subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State law or Federal law. Each violation
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 3/767
may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the City shall be separate and distinct from any
penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a State or
Federal agency.
SECTION 4: The Non-Harassment Policy section is hereby amended in part by deleting the following language:
In order to administer this policy, all employees have a responsibility to report any incident of harassment to the
attention of their immediate supervisor. Employees who feel aggrieved because of harassment are strongly
encouraged to bring the matter to the immediate attention of their supervisor.
SECTION 5: The Non-Harassment Policy section is hereby amended in part by deleting the following language
of paragraph 8:
Employees who have a complaint of harassment should follow the following steps:
1. Employees are encouraged, whenever appropriate; to directly inform the person engaging in harassing
conduct that such conduct is offensive and must stop.
2. The employee should verbally contact his/her immediate supervisor to register a complaint of
harassment.
3. In the event the immediate supervisor is the person engaging in the harassing conduct, the employee
should contact the City Administrator or the Mayor.
4. As soon as practicable after the completion of the investigation, the designated investigator will apprise
the City Council of its findings and, with appropriate legal counsel, pursue resolution of the matter.
SECTION 6: The Non-Harassment policy Section is hereby amended in part by adding the following new
paragraph 9; and which shall be and read as follows:
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes she/he to be the object of sexual harassment
should deal with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be
directed at the person making the report. Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
· Electronic/Direct Communication. If there is sexual harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed
employee should directly and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and
request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages
are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
· Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 4/767
reported to the immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a director of
human resources, an ethics officer, the City Administrator, or the Mayor of the City of Countryside.
The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must not assume that the
employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or
other responsible officer, the City of Countryside will not be presumed to have knowledge of the
harassment.
· Resolution Outside the City of Countryside. The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough
and effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that problems can be identified
and remedied by the City of Countryside. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
for information regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed
within 180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC
must be filed within 300 days.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said or done, the date, the time and
the place), including, but not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated regardless of how the matter
comes to the attention of the City of Countryside. However, because of the serious implications of sexual
harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of credibility
involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate
outcome.
SECTION 7: The Non-Harassment Policy section here hereby amended in part by deleting the following
paragraph 10:
To the extent possible, every reasonable attempt will be made to maintain confidentiality during the course of an
investigation into a charge of harassment.
SECTION 8: The Non-Harassment Policy section is hereby amended in part by adding the following new
paragraph 10; and which shall be and read as follows:
No City official, City agency, City employee or City office shall take any retaliatory action against any City
employee due to a City employee’s:
1. Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy,
2. The provision of information related to or testimony before any public body conducting an investigation,
hearing or inquiry into any violation of this policy, or
3. Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this policy.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 5/767
For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial
of promotion or transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is
taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected activity pursuant to this policy.
No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made in good faith is not substantiated.
In addition, any witness will be protected from retaliation.
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5
ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does
any of the following:
1. Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of
any officer, member, State agency, or other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes
is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
2. Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or
inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee, or
3. Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee
who discloses information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or
committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not
retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a State or federal law,
rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two
or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has made a
charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
SECTION 9: The Non-Harassment Policy section is hereby amended in part by adding the following new
paragraph 11; and which shall be and read as follows:
Persons making false reports: A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the
sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for
reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given
the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense that can
itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 6/767
provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable City policies,
employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of the State
Officials and Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a State’s
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An
ethics commission may levy an administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.
SECTION 10: This Ordinance shall not be held to repeal a former ordinance as to any offense committed
against the former ordinance or as to any act done, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any
right accrued or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatsoever affect any such offense or
act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred to any right accrued to claims
arising before this Ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform to the
ordinance in force at the time of such proceedings, as far as practicable.
SECTION 11: That if any part or parts of this Ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court
of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts
of this Ordinance. The City Council declare hereby that they would have passed the remaining parts of this
Ordinance, if they had known that such part or parts thereof would be declared unconstitutional.
SECTION 12: The City Clerk of the City of Countryside is directed hereby to publish this Ordinance in pamphlet
form.
SECTION 13: This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage, approval, and
publication in pamphlet form.

A. Retaliation…
… No officer, employee, agent or servant of the City shall retaliate against any person who discloses or
threatens to disclose any violation of this Chapter, provides information to any public body pursuant to this
Chapter, or who assists or participates in any proceeding to enforce this Chapter.
For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial

charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a promotion after filing a
complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge – due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC)

REGISTRATION OF DEFAULTED MORTGAGE AND VACANT PROPERTY
8-11-1 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
It is the purpose and intent of the Mayor and City Council to establish a process to address the deterioration,
crime, and decline in value of City neighborhoods caused by property with defaulted mortgages located within
the City, and to identify, regulate, limit and reduce the number of these properties located within the City. It has
been determined that Owner-occupied structures are generally better maintained when compared to vacant
structures, even with a diligent off-site property Owner. Vacant structures or structures owned by individuals
who are economically strained and unable to meet their mortgage obligations are often not properly or diligently
maintained, which contribute to blight, declined property values, and have a negative impact on social
perception of the residential areas where they are located. It is the Mayor and City Council’s further intent to
establish a registration program as a mechanism to help protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted
through the lack of adequate maintenance of properties that are in Default or Defaulted, and to provide a
mechanism to avert foreclosure actions through timely intervention, education, or counseling of property
Owners.

limited to: overgrown and/or dead vegetation; past due Utility notices and/or disconnected Utilities;

furnishings and/or personal items consistent with habitation or occupancy; the presence of an unsanitary,

1-1-2: ACCEPTANCE:
The City Code, as hereby presented in printed form, shall hereafter be received without further proof in all

1-1-3: AMENDMENTS:
Any ordinance amending this City Code shall set forth the title, chapter and section number of the section or

prepared for insertion in its proper place in each copy of this City Code. Each such replacement page shall be

SAVING CLAUSE
1-2-1: REPEAL OF GENERAL ORDINANCES:

of real estate by or from the City; and all special ordinances. (1986 Code)
The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are substantially the same as all those other ordinances
existing at the time of the adoption of this Code, shall be construed as a continuation thereof and not as new
enactments. (1970 Code §1-1.07)
1-2-2: PUBLIC UTILITY ORDINANCES:
No ordinance relating to streets and other public ways, or relating to the conduct, duties, service or rates of
public utilities shall be repealed by virtue of the preceding section, excepting as this City Code may contain
provisions for such matters, in which case this City Code shall be considered as amending such ordinance or
ordinances in respect to such provisions only. (1986 Code)
1-2-3: COURT PROCEEDINGS:
No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance whether such former ordinance is
expressly repealed or not, as to any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done,
any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising under the former
ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty,
forfeiture or punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes effect,
save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding,

such provision may be, by consent of the party affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new
ordinance takes effect.
This Section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or implication, whether the repeal is in the
ordinance making any new provisions upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of
any general ordinance of the City herein repealed and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this
Code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the same provision; nor shall
this Chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as
affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of the City under any ordinance
or provision thereof in force at the time of the adoption of this City Code. (1986 Code)

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 56/767
Sick leave benefits are payable to an employee under the following conditions:
1. The allowance period will begin as of the date the employee gives oral or written notification of disability
to his department head or supervisor, or, in the event of inability to reach a department head or
supervisor, to the desk officer on duty at the Police Department1. No sick leave will be granted unless the
employee reports to the department head or supervisor, or leaves such notification with the Police
Department, not less than one hour prior to his scheduled starting time. The employee, in making this
report, must do so in person or through another person, stating the reason for his being unable to work
and the amount of time he will expect to be absent.
2. Any employee who is disabled for three (3) consecutive days or more will, upon request, furnish his
department head or supervisor with written evidence from a physician stating:
a. That the employee is disabled;
b. Nature of illness or injury; and
c. When the employee will be capable of returning to work.
3. Pay for any employee during the sick leave allowance period shall be at his regular salary rate.

cases and with prior approval of the City Council, grant additional days of sick leave even if sick leave
credit is not available.
5. Violations of the regulations for use of sick leave or request of sick leave for an improper purpose is an
act of dishonesty and can result in disciplinary action or discharge.
6. It is the employee's responsibility to:
a. Promptly notify the department head, or supervisor, or the desk officer on duty at the Police
Department, of illness or injury;
b. Obtain adequate medical treatment to speed recovery; and
c. Provide satisfactory proof of disability and submit such medical return-to-work clearance as required by
this policy.

expected to return to duty status six (6) weeks after the birth of the child.
If an employee fails to report back to duty status when released by her physician, it shall be equivalent to a
resignation and/or a dismissal will be sought from the City Council. (1970 Code §2-18.02)
E. Accumulation Of Sick Leave: Sick leave will be credited on the employee's personnel reports at the rate of
one day of sick leave credit accumulated each month, which will total twelve (12) working days of sick leave
credit each year. This sick leave can accumulate to a maximum of two hundred thirty six (236) working days
of sick leave credit. Sick leave credit will not accumulate beyond this two hundred thirty six (236) working
days limit.
At retirement, with a minimum of ten (10) years of service, at age fifty five (55) or older, full-time employees

the group accident and health insurance provided by the City at the time of their retirement, and who elect to
do so, or who elect to secure and maintain such coverage on their own, the City will pay up to one-half (1/2)
of the monthly premium, not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month, so long as such retired
employee is eligible to continue such coverage and elects to do so.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 58/767
1-6A-7: EMPLOYEE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES:
A. Purpose: Section 504 Regulations of the Office of Revenue Sharing (31 C.F.R. 51.55 (d)(2)) requires that
each recipient of revenue sharing funds adopt a grievance procedure which may be utilized by persons who
believe that such recipient, by its policies or inaccessibility of facilities or programs, discriminates against
individuals because of handicapped status. Section 504 states, in part, that "no otherwise qualified
handicapped individual . . . shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal
financial assistance . . .". Therefore, the City adopts the following internal grievance procedure providing for
prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the Office of Revenue
Sharing's (ORS) regulations (31 C.F.R. 51.55 (d)(2)) implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794). (1970 Code §2-19.01, as amended)
B. Procedure:
1. Complaints should be addressed to: Mayor of the City of Countryside, 5550 East Avenue, Countryside,
Illinois 60525, who has been designated to coordinate section 504 compliance efforts.
2. A complaint may be filed in writing or verbally, should contain the name and address of the person filing it,
and briefly describe the alleged violation of the regulations.
3. A complaint should be filed within thirty (30) days after the complainant becomes aware of the alleged
violation. (Processing of allegations of discrimination occurring before this grievance procedure was
adopted will be considered on a case-by-case basis.)
4. An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow filing of a complaint. All such investigations will be
conducted by the Mayor. These rules contemplate informal but thorough investigations, affording all
interested persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to a
complaint. Under 31 C.F.R. 51.55 (d)(2), the City need not process complaints from applicants for
employment.
5. A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and description of resolution, if any, shall be
issued by the Mayor and a copy forwarded to the complainant no later than ninety (90) days after initial
filing of the complaint.
6. The section 504 coordinator shall maintain the files and records of the City relating to the complaints filed.
7. The complainant can request a reconsideration of the case in instances where he is dissatisfied with the
resolution. The request for reconsideration should be made within thirty (30) days to the Mayor.
8. The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint filed hereunder shall not be
impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as the filing of a section 504 complaint with the
Office of Revenue Sharing, U.S. Department of the Treasury. Utilization of this grievance procedure is not
a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies. (1970 Code §2-19.02, as amended)
C. Construction Of Rules: These rules shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of interested persons,
to meet appropriate due process standards and to assure that the City complies with section 504 and the
ORS regulations. (1970 Code §2-19.03, as amended)
1-6A-8: VACATION TIME FOR PART-TIME REGULAR EMPLOYEES:
A. Definitions:
PART-TIME REGULAR EMPLOYEE: A person regularly employed by the City but whose total base hours of
work are less than two thousand eighty (2,080) hours per year.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 59/767
REGULARLY EMPLOYED: Employment for which the employee is expected to report to work on a regular
basis and which, regardless of the length of time between periods of work, shall not require that the
employee go through any reemployment procedures or be rehired.
B. Computation Of Vacation Time: Each part-time regular employee shall be entitled to paid vacation based
upon the ratio his or her annual base hours of work bears to the number of the minimum annual base work
hours of a full-time employee, two thousand eighty (2,080), multiplied by the number of vacation days to
which a full-time employee with the same number of years worked would be entitled. Where such product
results in a fraction of five-tenths (0.5) or more, the employee shall receive one additional day of paid
vacation. (i.e., where a part-time regular employee has an annual base of 1,560 work hours, the ratio his or
her base bears to that of a full-time employee is 0.75. If that part-time regular employee has completed 6
years of employment, he or she shall receive 75 percent of the 15 days of paid vacation to which a full-time
employee with 6 years of service is entitled. Because the product of multiplying 10 work days by 0.75 equals
7.5, the employee would be entitled to 8 days of paid vacation time.) (Ord. 93-09-0, 1-27-1993)

(Ord. 95-32-0, 8-23-95)
1-11-4: EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES:
A. The educational decisions should reflect current career plan goals.
B. It is recommended that the employee's career plans be periodically reviewed by his or her supervisors in
conjunction with all educational plans.
C. Questions concerning the appropriateness of a course or a degree should be directed to the employee's
supervisor.
D. TAP applicants must report any monies received from another agency or institution (e.g., scholarship,
fellowship, grant, Veterans' Educational Assistance) for TAP-covered tuition and allowed expenses. These
funds are deducted from TAP payments. Failure to report these funds is considered misconduct and may
result in loss of tuition assistance and disciplinary action up to and including termination.
E. Employees must also inform granting agencies or institutions of tuition assistance received from the City.
F. To be covered by the TAP, an employee must receive a minimum grade of "C-" (C minus) or equivalent for
each course. A grade of "pass" is acceptable for courses graded on a "pass/fail" basis.
Employees must submit an original grade report within sixty (60) days of course completion.
An incomplete grade ("I") is valid for one hundred twenty (120) days from the course completion date. All
that time, the supervisor assigns an "F" if a passing grade report is not received.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 86/767
Further tuition assistance may be denied until an employee has demonstrated successful completion of the
course.
G. TAP participants are also responsible to:
1. Tell his or her supervisor of educational plans so the supervisor can budget funds.
2. Discuss career goals with the supervisor and link to educational goals.
3. Consult with the supervisor on course(s) or degree(s) relating to job or career plan.
4. Seek supervisory guidance to ensure educational activities will not negatively effect job performance.
5. Prepare TAP request completely and accurately and submit to supervisor for initial review and approval.
6. Submit a completed original request for final review and approval at least three (3) weeks before course
starts. Reimbursements or payment will not be made if the original application arrives after course finish
date.
7. Submit original, itemized documents showing payment of tuition and allowed expenses.
8. Submit an original grade report to the supervisor (within sixty calendar days after completing course).
Further, tuition assistance may be denied until an employee has demonstrated successful completion of
each course taken.
H. Employees should discuss educational plans with their supervisors before applying for tuition assistance.
(Ord. 95-32-0, 8-23-95)
1-11-5: REIMBURSEMENTS:
When tuition repayment is required, the employee should contact the City (preferably through his or her
supervisor) as soon as possible but not later than sixty (60) days after course completion to arrange
reimbursement.
Payment is made when original itemized expense statements from the school, or itemized bills and receipts
from the employee are provided to the City. (Ord. 95-32-0, 8-23-95)
1-11-6: TAX CONSIDERATIONS:
Tuition assistance is considered income when a course or degree is not directly job related and the total
nondirectly job-related annual tuition exceeds Federal, State, or local exclusion limits. As the tax laws are
changed, the students withholdings may vary. Most states follow Federal tax laws for tuition assistance. If the
tuition is taxable at the Federal level, the aggregate withholding is approximately thirty eight percent (38%) of
the total taxable tuition assistance. The employee's tax liability, however, may vary based upon personal
circumstances.
Tuition assistance is treated according to the tax laws in effect when the grades are processed and associated
course dollars are expended to the proper area.
Note: Employees should consult their personal tax advisor about tuition assistance taxability, since tax laws are
subject to change from time-to-time. (Ord. 95-32-0, 8-23-95)
1-11-7: SUPERVISOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 87/767
The employee's supervisor at the time of course enrollment has the responsibility to do the following:
A. Review selected course or degree for content and job/career relatedness.
B. Determine whether the number of credits of courses requested will negatively affect employee's job
performance.
C. Align employee's educational goals with current career plan (if appropriate).
D. Ensure TAP participants are aware of their obligations to:
1. Pay applicable taxes for course(s)/degree(s) that are not directly job-related;
2. Verify that the requested courses are scheduled during nonwork hours.
E. Ensure that requests are submitted to the Finance Committee for final review and approval within the
requested time frame.
Note: The supervisor should advise the employee to submit a copy of the applied for course(s) at least three
(3) weeks before a course(s) start(s). If late fees are assessed for a job-related reason (e.g., extended
business trip), send a letter of explanation to the supervisor.
F. Discuss TAP with new employees and TAP participation status with transferred employees.
G. Allocate funds for tuition when preparing or reviewing budgets, since tuition assistance is an organizational
expense. (Ord. 95-32-0, 8-23-95)
1-11-8: CONFLICTS WITH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT:
If any provisions in this Chapter differ from the requirements of a collective bargaining agreement, the collective

manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

petition filed within twenty one (21) days after the issuance of the order of default, if the hearing officer

Policy prohibits all forms of sexual harassment.
The protections in the Policy are enforced by the City Council acting ex officio as the City Commission on
Human Rights. The Commission is empowered to conciliate and conduct hearings on complaints of sexual
harassment and to order the implementation of measures for the prevention, alleviation, remediation, and
punishment of violations of the Policy. (Ord. 99-17-0, 4-14-1999)

This section has been affected by a recently passed ordinance, 18-2 - ANTI-SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.
Go to new ordinance.
1-13-3: EMPLOYMENT:
A. Coverage: The prohibitions against sexual harassment contained in this section apply to employment that is
or would be in whole or in part by the City.
B. Prohibitions: The City shall not directly or indirectly permit or commit any act of "sexual harassment" as
defined in this section against any individual in hiring, classification, grading, recruitment, discharge,
discipline, compensation, selection for training and apprenticeship, or other term, privilege, or condition of
employment, on the basis of an individual's refusal to grant favors of a sexual nature. (Ord. 99-17-0, 4-14-
1999)
C. Sexual Harassment:
1. Neither any officer of the City, nor any employee thereof, nor any agent or servant thereof, (hereinafter
referred to collectively in this section as "employer") shall engage in sexual harassment. "Sexual
harassment" means any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors, and other verbal and
physical conduct of a sexual nature when: a) submission to such conduct is an explicit or implicit term or
condition of an individual's employment; or b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual
is used as the basis for any employment decision affecting the individual; or c) such conduct has the
purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
2. The City is responsible for acts of sexual harassment between coemployees in the workplace when,
through its agents or supervisory employees, it knew or in the exercise of ordinary care should have
known, of the conduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. The
City may also be responsible for the actions of nonemployees, with respect to sexual harassment of
employees in the workplace, where through its agents or supervisory employees, it knew or in the
exercise of ordinary care should have known of the conduct and could have but failed to take immediate
and appropriate corrective action. (Ord. 99-17-0, 4-14-1999; amd. Ord. 18-01-0, 1-10-2018)
3. An employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must not assume that the
City is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the City will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
4. Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
a. Verbal: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or
gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 93/767
other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
b. Non-verbal: Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive
bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking" or "kissing" noises.
c. Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or
websites.
d. Physical: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act
or actual assault.
e. Textual/electronic: "Sexting" (electronically sending messages with sexual content, including pictures
and video), the use of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant
messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
5. The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine. On the other end of the
spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception
and interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
"reasonable person". (Ord. 18-01-0, 1-10-2018)
D. Police Department: All regular full-time, certified police officers, who are subject to disciplinary action by the
Fire and Police Commission, are specifically exempted from the provisions of this policy, such officers being
within the jurisdiction of the police regulations in section 4-1-17, "General Rules Of Conduct", of this Code
which provides for its own anti-sexual harassment policy including investigation, enforcement and discipline.

C. Sexual Harassment:
1. No officer, employees, agent or servant of the City shall engage in sexual harassment in the provision or
distribution of any City facilities, services, or programs. "Sexual harassment" means any unwelcome
sexual advance, request for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
a) submission to such conduct is an explicit or implicit term or condition of an individual's use of City
facilities, or the provision of City services or programs; or b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by
an individual is used as the basis for any decision affecting the provision or allocation of City services or
programs, or the use of City facilities; or c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's access to City services, programs, or facilities, or the conduct creates an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for the provision of City services or programs, or in the use
of City facilities. (Ord. 99-17-0, 4-14-1999; amd. Ord. 18-01-0, 1-10-2018)

responsible officer, the City will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
3. Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
a. Verbal: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or
gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about
other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
b. Non-verbal: Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive
bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking" or "kissing" noises.
c. Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or
websites.
d. Physical: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act
or actual assault.
e. Textual/electronic: "Sexting" (electronically sending messages with sexual content, including pictures
and video), the use of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant
messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
4. The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine. On the other end of the
spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception
and interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
"reasonable person". (Ord. 18-01-0, 1-10-2018)
1-13-5: CONTRACTS:
A. Prohibition: No person who is a party to a contract with the City shall engage in sexual harassment against
any individual in the terms or conditions of employment, credit, public accommodations, housing, or
provision of facilities, services or programs. "Sexual harassment" has such meaning as is ascribed to it in
this chapter.
B. Contract Provisions: Any purchasing agent for the City, and any department heads, as authorized by the City
Council, shall include a provision in all City contracts that sets forth the City's policies with respect to sexual
harassment, as embodied in this chapter, and that requires every contractor to certify its compliance with
these policies and its agreement to abide by such policies as a part of the contractor's contractual
obligations.
All City contracts shall further provide that if any party to a contract with the City is found to have violated
any provision of this chapter, or furnished false or misleading information in any investigation, hearing, or
inquiry held pursuant to this chapter, that contract may be subject to a declaration of default and termination.
C. Exception: This section applies only to contracts executed after the effective date of this chapter. (Ord. 99-
17-0, 4-14-1999)

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 95/767
A. Retaliation: No officer, employee, agent or servant of the City shall retaliate against any person because that
person in good faith has opposed that which he or she reasonably believed to be sexual harassment, or
other violation of this chapter, or has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter. (Ord. 99-17-0, 4-14-1999)
No officer, employee, agent or servant of the City shall retaliate against any person who discloses or
threatens to disclose any violation of this chapter, provides information to any public body pursuant to this
chapter, or who assists or participates in any proceeding to enforce this chapter.
For the purposes of this chapter, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge, suspension,
demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any City
employee that is taken in retaliation for a City employee's involvement in protected activity pursuant to this
chapter.
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics
Act1 provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension,
demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the
following:
1. Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of
any officer, member, State agency, or other State employee that the State employee reasonably
believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
2. Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or
inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other
State employee, or
3. Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act2, an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses
information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses
a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against
an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee
has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule,
or regulation3.
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act4, it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two (2) or more
people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has made
a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing
under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a promotion after filing
a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge - due within one hundred eighty (180) days
(IDHR) or three hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. (Ord. 18-01-0, 1-10-2018)
B. Aiding And Abetting: No officer, employee, agent or servant of the City shall wilfully interfere with the
performance of a duty or the exercise of a power by the City Administrator, City Attorney, City Prosecutor or
City Council hereunder. (Ord. 99-17-0, 4-14-1999)
C. False Reporting: A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the sexual
harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for
reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 96/767
Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of this chapter shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
City policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining
agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to an Ethics Commission, an Inspector General, the State Police,
a State's Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty of a Class A
misdemeanor. An Ethics Commission may levy an administrative fine of up to five thousand dollars
($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 18-

and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the City. However, because of
the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their
investigation and the questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital
component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. (Ord. 99-17-0, 4-14-1999; amd. Ord. 18-
01-0, 1-10-2018)

represented at said conference by legal counsel.
b. At the hearing on the charge(s), respondent may be represented by legal counsel, and the City may be
represented by the assigned City Prosecutor or other counsel of its choice. Either side may call

For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit,

application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all
periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax,
interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with
applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must
be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date
agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment
of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final
determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 00-40-0, 12-13-2000)

of the premises to be inspected to admit thereto, for the purpose of making the inspection, any officer or
employee of the city who is authorized or directed to make such inspection at any reasonable time
admission is requested.
B. Whenever an analysis of any commodity or material is reasonably necessary to secure conformance with
any ordinance provision or to detect violations thereof, it shall be the duty of the licensee, whose business is
governed by this provision to give any authorized officer or employee of the city requesting the same
sufficient samples of such material or commodity for such analysis, upon request.

such officer or employee, who is authorized to make such inspection or take such sample, to make the
inspection or take an adequate sample of said material or commodity, or who interferes with such officer or
employee while in the performance of his duty in making such inspection; provided, that no license shall be

relating to the business licensed hereunder. Every act or omission of whatever nature which constitutes a
violation of the provisions of this code, other ordinances or state laws relating to the business licensed
hereunder by any officer, director, manager, agent or employee of the licensee shall be deemed and held to
be the act of the licensee, and such act shall be punishable in the same manner as if such an act or
omission had been committed or omitted by the licensee personally.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 126/767
B. The health officer, building commissioner or police chief shall have the authority to suspend any license,
other than liquor licenses, when there is good cause to believe that either the public health or public safety
will be endangered by continuance of any licensed business operation. Notice of such suspension will be
given to the licensee and city council and shall cite the violation giving rise to the suspension. The licensee
shall be given an immediate emergency hearing by the city council who shall determine the length of
suspension and/or revocation of the license.
C. In the case of revocations, other than liquor licenses, the health officer, building commissioner, police chief or
city clerk shall give notice of intent to revoke any license to the licensee and city council three (3) days prior

as necessary to correct the violations cited. A revocation of license may be determined as permanent or
indefinite for any licensee. (Ord. 13-26-0, 5-22-2013)

section is not intended to license or regulate the businesses subject hereto. (1970 Code §8-0.01)
B. Registration Required, Expiration: It is unlawful for any person to carry on any business activity, except those
business activities which are specifically licensed and regulated by this code without first having registered

name of the business to be registered, the location to be used and such further information as may

issued. The city clerk shall send each registrant a statement of the time of expiration of the certificate held
by that registrant, three (3) weeks prior to the date of such expiration. However, failure to send such notice,
or failure of registrant to receive it, shall not excuse the registrant from failure to obtain a new certificate, or a
renewal thereof, nor shall it be a defense in an action for operating without a certificate. (1970 Code §8-
0.06)
G. Registration Fee: The annual fee for each certificate of business registration shall be twenty five dollars
($25.00) payable at the office of the city clerk at the time application for the certificate is made. The fee for
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

annual registration shall not be proratable; however, any new business commencing operation after
November 30, or any existing business commencing operation at an additional or new location or changing
its name after that date, may apply for a certificate for the next succeeding year and registration completed
pursuant to such application shall be deemed sufficient for the remainder of the current year also, at no
additional charge. If a registration renewal is not purchased by January 31 of the current year, a penalty of
twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be added to the registration fee. If said registration fee and penalty is not
remitted by January 31 of the current registration year, the fee plus a penalty equal to twice the amount of
the registration will be added and said business shall be issued a citation for a hearing before the city
adjudications hearing officer. (Ord. 08-21-0, 4-23-2008)
H. Nonassignability, Nonapplicability To New Location Or Name: Any change of ownership, location or name of

h. Equipment Installation And Specifications: The equipment shall be installed so that only the front of the
machine shall be exposed in the customer area. The working or maintenance portion of the equipment
shall be separated from the front of the machine by a solid partition. As a means of minimizing any
solvent buildup in the customer area and also to control any minor solvent leakage, it is required that
there be a minimum flow rate from the customer area through the partition as follows:
Number Of Machines
Minimum Flow Rate
Per Machine (cfm)*
1 - 3 500
4 - 8 400
9 - 16 375
17 or more 360
*Each cleaning cell shall constitute 1 machine.
The exhaust ventilation as described above shall be provided on a continuous basis while the store is open for
business. The fan wiring shall be such that the dry-cleaning equipment cannot be operated unless the fan
system is in operation.
Where grille openings are to be installed in the partition to facilitate air movement, they should be sized on the
basis of about five hundred (500) cfm per square foot of net grille area and should be placed as close to the
machines as possible. An example would be the use of a thirty inch by six inch (30" x 6") grille located directly
over a machine.
A supply of tempered make-up air shall be provided for the customer service area in an amount approximately
equal to the exhaust ventilation required in the table on minimum flow rate per machine in this subsection. The
device shall be capable of providing the above amount of make-up air at room design temperature with an
outside air temperature equal to the mean winter temperature. In all cases it is required that the exhaust rate be
slightly greater than the make-up rate which will at all times maintain a slight negative pressure in the customer
service area.
Access doors to the maintenance area shall be kept locked.
Where there is no airflow through the partition between the customer and service area, the exhaust ventilation
required in the table on minimum flow rate per machine in this subsection is sufficient; provided, that it is
operated continuously with a satisfactory source of tempered make-up air in the service area. The volume of
make-up air provided in the service area should be slightly less than the exhaust capacity in order that a slight
negative pressure be maintained in the service area at all times. A supply of suitably tempered make-up air
should be supplied for the customer area. (1970 Code §8-4.11)
i. Auxiliary Fan: Where there is airflow between the customer and the service area, it is also required that
a general ventilation fan be installed in the backroom or maintenance area to be used in case of serious
solvent leakage. This fan may be installed in the rear wall and, when combined with the system
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 141/767
required in this subsection, should enable the exhausting of twice the amount of air required in the table
on minimum flow rate per machine in subsection C1h hereinabove.
j. Prevention Of Leaks: A satisfactory means of preventing liquid leaks from escaping the enclosure must
be provided. The floor of the enclosure or machine base shall be diked so as to hold a liquid volume
equal to the maximum quantity of solvent which might possibly escape from the system. A method shall
be provided for draining and containing solvent in the event of a leak. Tanks so provided for containing
leaks shall be vented to the outside.
In lieu of the diking aforesaid, the integral pan and piping system may be used, provided that the piping
system is connected to a properly sized and vented tank as described above. (1970 Code §8-4.13)
k. Use As Dwelling: Equipment shall not be installed in a building occupied as a dwelling place. (1970
Code §8-4.14)

submit to the building commissioner a complete set of plans and specifications of the building in which
such dry-cleaning establishment is to be located and also a complete diagram of the floor plan of each
room to be occupied, correctly showing the area of all machinery and ventilating equipment to be
installed therein. (1970 Code §8-4.15)
m. Solvent Storage: The solvent shall be stored in closed containers, and should be transferred from the
containers in a line free of leaks. All storage facilities for solvent, external from the equipment, must be
adequately and properly labeled. (1970 Code §8-4.21)
n. Residues: Filter residue and other residues containing solvent shall be disposed of so as not to create
a health hazard or nuisance. A covered metal container shall be used for temporary storage outside the
building. (1970 Code §8-4.22)
2. Attendant: Automatic dry-cleaning establishments may not be operated unless an attendant is on the
premises at all times when such equipment is available for use by the public. Such attendant shall be
trained and well-qualified in the procedures relative to the safe operation of such equipment. The
attendant as well as the owner shall be responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of this
subsection. (1970 Code §8-4.16)
3. Instructions And Warnings:
a. Instructions: Complete operating instructions shall be posted near the machines. These instructions
shall include a warning to the effect that garments of materials bearing the odor of the solvent are
dangerous if enclosed in an automobile or other tightly enclosed place. (1970 Code §8-4.17)
b. Warning Signs: Signs shall be posted requesting evacuation of the establishment in the presence of
noticeable vapor odor or in the presence of such symptoms as irritation of the eyes, nose or throat,
lacrimation or dizziness.

hereby. The Clerk also may appoint one or more agents to sell these stamps.
B. New Design:
1. The Clerk from time to time may provide for the issuance and exclusive use of tax stamps of new design
and forbid the use of stamps of any prior design, but only after giving at least sixty (60) days' notice of the
change. The notice shall be published at least three (3) times in one or more daily newspapers of general
circulation in the City during the sixty (60) day period before the change takes effect. After the effective

design of stamps to pay the tax imposed hereby.
2. Any person lawfully in possession of unused tax stamps of a superseded issue or design may, not later
than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the change, surrender the stamps to the Clerk together
with a sworn application setting forth the name and address of the owner and party surrendering the

reasonably may require. If the Clerk determines that the application is in proper order, she or he promptly
shall issue, or authorize an agent to issue, replacement stamps of the new issue or design in exchange
for the surrendered stamps.
C. Sale: No person shall sell or expose for sale, traffic in, trade, barter or exchange tax stamps issued pursuant

trade, barter or exchange any transfer tax stamps for an amount less than the stamp's face value.
D. Cancellation: In every case where a tax stamp is used to pay the tax imposed hereby, the person affixing the
stamp shall write or stamp thereupon the person's name or initials and the date upon which the stamp is
affixed, and further shall cut or perforate the stamp in a substantial manner so that the stamp cannot be
again used; provided, however, that no such stamp shall be defaced in such a manner as to prevent its
authenticity from being determined. (Ord. 96-25-0, 6-12-1996, eff. 8-1-1996)
3-10-8: OPEN TRANSACTIONS:
In the case of a transfer where any part of the transfer price is contingent upon the occurrence of a future event

additional amount of consideration is furnished. (Ord. 96-25-0, 6-12-1996, eff. 8-1-1996)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 265/767

Section 3-10-5 of this Chapter, shall be subject to a penalty equal to the amount of the tax and interest at the
rate of five percent (5%) per annum on the tax from the date due until paid. This penalty and interest shall be in

A. In the event that the tax imposed hereby is not paid when due, the City shall have a lien against the related
real property in an amount equal to the tax, together with all applicable interest and penalties. The lien shall
expire only at such time as the outstanding tax, interest and penalties are paid in full, or the lien is
foreclosed within the period for bringing a foreclosure action, described in subsection 3-10-10C below,
expires.
B. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to give the City's lien a preferential priority over the rights of any
bona fide purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lienor, mortgagee or judgment lien creditor
arising or existing prior to the recording of an instrument evidencing the City's lien with the Recorder of
Deeds of Cook County; providing, however, that the City's lien, whether or not recorded, shall have priority
over any interest in the real property, including any lien, acquired by a person in connection with the person
providing financing to the transferee taxpayer (or the taxpayer's nominee or designee) for the acquisition of
the real property. The absence of the tax stamp required hereby on the deed, assignment or other
instrument of transfer pursuant to which the transferee taxpayer acquired title to, or beneficial interest in, the
real property shall constitute constructive notice of the City's lien to the person providing financing.
C. The City may not commence any action to foreclose upon the lien more than seven (7) years after the
transfer giving rise to the tax liability; provided, however, that the running of the seven (7) year period shall
be stayed for the duration of any judicial order enjoining or restraining the City from instituting a foreclosure
proceeding. (Ord. 96-25-0, 6-12-1996, eff. 8-1-1996)

Smoke of number 4 or 5 density is never permitted. Smoke of number 1 density is permitted at all
times).
a. The Ringelmann Chart shall be the standard for determining the appearance, density or shade of
smoke. The scale should be held at arm's length at which distance the dots in the scale will blend into
uniform shades. Observer's line of observation should be at right angles to the direction of smoke
travel. Observer should not be less than one hundred feet (100') nor more than one-quarter (1/4) mile
from the stack. Observer should avoid looking towards bright sunlight. The background immediately
beyond the top of the stack should be free of buildings or other dark objects. Where the density of the
smoke as observed falls between two (2) consecutive Ringelmann Numbers, the lower Ringelmann
Number shall be considered the density of smoke observed. For the purpose of calculating smoke
units, a Ringelmann density reading shall be made at least once every minute during the period of
observation; and each reading shall be multiplied by the time in minutes during which it is observed.
The various products thus obtained shall be added together to give the total number of "smoke units"
observed during the total period under observation.
The Ringelmann Chart as published by the United States Bureau of Mines is adopted by reference and
three (3) copies of said chart are on file in the office of the City Clerk and available for public use,

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the CITY OF COUNTRYSIDE SMOKE FREE ACT. (Ord. 08-
19-0, 4-9-2008)
6-8-2: FINDINGS:
The city council of the city of Countryside finds that tobacco smoke is a harmful and dangerous carcinogen to
human beings and a hazard to public health. Secondhand tobacco smoke causes at least sixty five thousand
(65,000) deaths each year from heart disease and lung cancer according to the National Cancer Institute.
Secondhand tobacco smoke causes heart disease, stroke, cancer, sudden infant death syndrome, low birth
weight in infants, asthma and exacerbation of asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia in children and adults.
Secondhand tobacco smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Illinois
workers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke are at increased risk of premature death. An estimated two
thousand nine hundred (2,900) Illinois citizens die each year from exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke.
The city council of the city of Countryside also finds that the United States surgeon general's 2006 report has
determined that there is no risk free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; the scientific evidence that
secondhand smoke causes serious diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses
such as bronchitis and asthma, is massive and conclusive; separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the
air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate secondhand smoke exposure; smoke free workplace policies are
effective in reducing secondhand smoke exposure; and smoke free workplace policies do not have an adverse
economic impact on the hospitality industry.
The city council of the city of Countryside also finds that the Illinois environmental protection agency has
determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation.
Air cleaners, which are capable only of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the
known toxins in secondhand smoke. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning
Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smoke free environments because it cannot
determine a safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, which contains cancer causing chemicals, and
ASHRAE acknowledges that technology does not exist that can remove chemicals that cause cancer from the
air. A June 30, 2005, ASHRAE position document on secondhand smoke concludes that, at present, the only
means of eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to eliminate all smoking activity indoors.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 432/767
7-4-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
A. Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the proper establishment of new trees, the protection
and maintenance of existing trees and the timely removal of hazardous, infectious or diseased trees on
property lying between property lines on either side of any streets, highways, and public rights of way; and
on or in any easements, public parks or any other areas owned or under the jurisdiction of the city. In this
regard, the city council finds and declares that:
1. Trees enhance and preserve the air quality of the city through the filtering effect of trees on air pollutants;
2. Trees reduce noise within the city through the baffle and barrier effect of trees on the spread of noise;
3. Trees reduce topsoil erosion through the soil retention effect of tree roots;
4. Trees reduce energy consumption through the wind break and shade effects of trees;
5. Trees provide nesting areas for birds and other wildlife, which birds and other wildlife, in turn, assist in the
control of insects;
6. Trees reduce stormwater runoff and the costs associated therewith;
7. Trees replenish groundwater supplies; and
8. Trees protect and increase property values.
B. Intent: It is the intent of the city council that the terms of this chapter shall be construed so as to promote:
1. The planting, maintenance, restoration and survival of desirable trees, shrubs and other plants within the
city; and
2. The protection of community residents from personal injury and property damage, and the protection of
the city from property damage, caused or threatened by the improper planting, maintenance, or removal
of, or the failure to remove hazardous, infectious or diseased trees, shrubs, or other plants located within
the city. (Ord. 12-11-0, 2-8-2012)

severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain city trees under utility wires or similar obstructions
where other pruning practices are impractical, may be exempted from this restriction upon the determination
of the public works superintendent. (Ord. 12-11-0, 2-8-2012)

A. Any person who damages a city tree, shrub or other plant, as provided in section 7-4-6 of this chapter, shall

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 467/767
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with
any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the city may pay
or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including,
without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this
chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the
permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant
to this chapter or any other applicable law.
B. Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash,
a surety bond in a form acceptable to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the city and the permittee;
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the city of any amounts covered by it;
and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
C. Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated
cost to restore the right of way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under
the permit, as determined by the city engineer, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that
the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the
city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations,
and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration
in the previous phase or phases, the city engineer may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the
permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest
amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
D. Withdrawals: The city, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its
intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security
fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the fourteen (14) day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
1. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the city has been compelled
to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city determines can be remedied by an
expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
E. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the city that any amount
has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount
specified in subsection C of this section.
F. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be
returned to the permittee by the city, upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 468/767
such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection C of
this section.
G. Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the
permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit,
within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the city for failure by
the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the
city as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall
be refunded to the permittee.
H. Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other
rights of the city, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding
or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the city may have.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to
any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 07-48-0, 12-12-2007)
7-10-11: PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION:

or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the municipality
shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
D. Abandonment Of Facilities: Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights of way of the city, the utility shall
notify the city within ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice, the city may direct the utility to
remove all or any portion of the facility if the city building commissioner determines that such removal will be
in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the city does not direct the utility
that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the city, the abandoning utility
shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or
person. (Ord. 07-48-0, 12-12-2007)
7-10-19: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:
The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain and other property within ten (10)
days after any portion of the rights of way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or
maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the city. This includes restoration of entrances and side
roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the city
building commissioner. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding,
resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right of way to a condition substantially equivalent to that
which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period provided in this section may be
extended by the city building commissioner for good cause shown. (Ord. 07-48-0, 12-12-2007)
7-10-20: MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE:
A. General: Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within rights of way are to be maintained
by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the city and at the utility's expense.
B. Emergency Maintenance Procedures: Emergencies may justify noncompliance with normal procedures for
securing a permit:
1. If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right of way, the utility shall take
immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of
way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the traveled
way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment
required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such
an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available.
2. In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the city building commissioner or his or her
duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for
protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature of
the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the city police shall be notified
immediately.

should be granted.
B. Authority To Grant Variances: The city building commissioner shall decide whether a variance is authorized
for each provision of this chapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
C. Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The city building commissioner may authorize a variance only if the
utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
1. One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right of
way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
2. All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from
which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
D. Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for authorizing a variance, the city building
commissioner may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of this
chapter.
E. Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial
of a variance, made by the city building commissioner under the provisions of this chapter shall have the
right to appeal to the city council, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The application
for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the city clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The city council shall commence its consideration of the appeal at
the board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal.

and for historical districts or landmarks.
8. Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a
wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole.
However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a
new utility pole, the City may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility
pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the proposed collocation,
which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the applicant shall provide written certification
describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.

services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days

wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are
the subject of an application submitted two (2) or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying
the City that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement remains in effect, subject

City utility pole.
If the City has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the fee shall be two hundred dollars
($200.00) payable on the first day after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of
intent to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.

caused by the sole negligence of the City or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive
any claims that they may have against the City with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages,
however caused, based on the theory of liability. (Ord. 18-30-0, 7-25-2018)

to the proposed variation and giving its recommendations for action to be taken by the Mayor and City
Council.
3. Standards: With respect to existing signs, a variation from existing regulations shall not be granted unless
evidence is presented that:
a. Because of the age, cost, or unique characteristics of the sign(s) in question, the strict enforcement of
such regulations would impose an undue hardship on the applicant;
b. The proposed variation would not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant but would alleviate
some demonstrable hardship not generally applicable to other properties;
c. The waiver of any of the provisions of this Chapter, or any other applicable regulation, would not have a
detrimental effect on any other nearby property;
d. The proposed variation is in harmony with the spirit and intent of this Chapter.
With respect to the erection of new signs, a variation from existing regulations shall not be granted
unless evidence is presented that:

irreversible hardship if made to conform to the strict letter of applicable regulations;

property; and

8-5-18: LEGAL NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
A. All signs legally in existence on the date of the adoption of this Chapter, and not specifically prohibited in
Section 8-5-7 hereof, which are not in compliance with this Chapter or any other applicable code, ordinance
or regulation, or any amendment thereto, governing the use of signs shall be termed legal nonconforming
signs and may be continued only as provided in this Chapter.
B. Whenever a legal nonconforming use of a sign has been discontinued for a period of six (6) consecutive
months, or whenever there is evidently a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a legal
nonconforming sign use, such use shall not, after being discontinued or abandoned, be re-established, and
the use of the sign thereafter shall be in conformity with the all applicable regulations.
C. Normal maintenance of a legal nonconforming sign is permitted, including necessary nonstructural repairs
and incidental alterations which do nor extend or intensify the legal nonconforming use.
D. No structural alteration, enlargement or extension shall be made for a legal nonconforming sign, except in
the following situations:
1. When the alteration is required by law;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 535/767
2. When the alteration will actually result in the elimination of the nonconforming use.
E. If a legal nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or
more of its replacement value at that time, the sign can be rebuilt or used thereafter only for a conforming
use and in compliance with the provisions of this Code. In the event the damage or destruction is less than
fifty percent (50%) of its replacement value, based upon prevailing costs, the sign may then be restored to
its original condition and use until the legal nonconforming sign use is otherwise abated by the provisions of
this Code. In either event, restoration or repair of the sign must be started within a period of six (6) months
from the date of damage or destruction and diligently pursued to completion. In every case the
reconstructed sign shall conform to the building and electrical codes in force at the time of its reconstruction.
F. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, all legal nonconforming signs shall be brought into
compliance:
1. Immediately upon their becoming an obsolete sign as defined in this Chapter; or
2. Immediately upon discontinuation when the nature of the business using and/or advertising upon any
such sign is changed.
G. No conforming sign shall be erected on the same zoning lot with an existing legal nonconforming sign until
the legal nonconforming sign has been removed or made to conform. However, in commercial centers, the
fact that one particular business or activity has a legal nonconforming sign will not prohibit another business
or activity within the same center from erecting a conforming sign. (Ord. 88-35-0, 8-24-88)

This chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to this city by 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/1-2-
1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8, and 5/11-31-2. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain this city's eligibility
in the national flood insurance program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of
life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of
surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related
land resources. This chapter is adopted in order to accomplish the following specific purposes:
A. To meet the requirements of 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/18 rivers, lakes and streams act;
B. To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage hazards to others, or create
unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
C. To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage;
D. To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;

E. To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood damaged public facilities and
utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations;
F. To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in the city by fulfilling the requirements of
the national flood insurance program;
G. To comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood insurance program codified as 44 CFR 59-79,
as amended;
H. To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; and
I. To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate
flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian
habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and
economic development. (Ord. 08-09-0, 3-12-2008)
8-6-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A nonhabitable structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal
structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure.
ACT: An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of the state of Illinois, 615 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq.
APPLICANT: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an application.
APPROPRIATE USE: Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and will be considered for
permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are as specified in subsection 8-6-7B of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
The base flood is also known as the 100-year frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at
any location is as defined in section 8-6-5 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the crest of the base flood.
BASEMENT: That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING: A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground,
including manufactured homes, prefabricated buildings, and gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes
recreational vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days per year.
CHANNEL: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial depression, ponded area, flowage,
slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully, ravine, wash, or natural or manmade drainageway, which has a definite
bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or ground water flows, either perennially or intermittently.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical dimensions or materials of its bed
or banks. Channel modification includes damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening,
straightening, relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom or banks. Channel
modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel.

COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent volume of storage within the
SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within
the floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase off site floodwater elevations
and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction approval by
IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This preconstruction approval, pursuant to
this chapter, gives assurances to the property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to
permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon review and acceptance of as
built plans.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that FEMA will revise base
flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries or floodways as shown on an effective flood
hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map, once the as built plans are submitted and approved.
CONTROL STRUCTURE: A structure designed to control the rate of flow that passes through the structure,
given a specific upstream and downstream water surface elevation.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of the population and, if flooded,
would create an added dimension to the disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of
vital services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can put special populations at
risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required include: emergency services
facilities (such as fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care facilities, major
roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous
material storage facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples of critical
facilities where flood protection is recommended include: sewage treatment plants, water treatment plants, and
pumping stations.
DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their abutments and appurtenant works, if
any, constructed for the purpose of storing or diverting water or creating a pool. Dams may also include weirs,
restrictive culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not included.
DESIGNATED FLOODWAY: The channel, including on stream lakes, and that portion of the floodplain adjacent
to a stream or watercourse, generally depicted on the FEMA FIRM map, which is needed to store and convey
the existing 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to the loss
of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent (10%) increase in velocities.
A. The floodways are designated for on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County prepared
by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008. When two (2) floodway maps exist for a waterway, the more
restrictive floodway limit shall prevail.
B. The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the city that may be annexed into the city are designated for any rivers or streams as
identified floodways on the countywide flood insurance rate map prepared by FEMA and dated August 19,
2008.
C. To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated floodway boundary should be
scaled off the designated floodway map and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to
both maps. Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the designated floodway
boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate, including:

1929 (NGVD).
NATURAL: When used in reference to channels means those channels formed by the existing surface
topography of the earth prior to changes made by man. A natural stream tends to follow a meandering path; its
floodplain is not constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed or cultivated; the
stream flows over soil and geologic materials typical of the area with no substantial alteration of the course or
cross section of the stream caused by filling or excavating. A modified channel may regain some natural
characteristics over time as the channel meanders and vegetation is reestablished. Similarly, a modified
channel may be restored to more natural conditions by man through regrading and revegetation.

certifications, or other evidence of compliance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided. (Ord. 08-09-0, 3-12-2008)
8-6-3: HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER:
A. The building official or designee shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in section 8-6-4 of this
chapter.
B. To fulfill those duties, the building official or designee should first use the criteria listed in section 8-6-5 of this
chapter, base flood elevations, to determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain.
C. Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the building official or designee must
determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within an SFHA
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 543/767
or floodplain for which no floodway has been identified.
1. If the site is within a flood fringe, the building official or designee shall require that the minimum
requirements of section 8-6-6 of this chapter be met.
2. If the site is within a floodway, the building official or designee shall require that the minimum
requirements of section 8-6-7 of this chapter be met.
3. If the site is located within an SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and
approved, the building official or designee shall require that the minimum requirements of section 8-6-8 of
this chapter be met.
D. In addition, the general requirements of section 8-6-9 of this chapter shall be met for all developments
meeting the requirements of section 8-6-6, 8-6-7 or 8-6-8 of this chapter.
E. The building official or designee shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of
section 8-6-10 of this chapter.

designee may take any and all actions as outlined in section 8-6-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 08-09-0, 3-12-
2008)
8-6-4: DUTIES OF THE BUILDING OFFICIAL:
A. Determining The Floodplain Designation:
1. Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a special flood hazard area (SFHA).
2. If they are in an SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or in a floodplain for which
a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one square mile.
3. Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than 1
square mile), indicating that the development would have adverse impacts regarding storage,
conveyance, or inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the
floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections of this chapter.
B. Professional Engineer Review:
1. If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been
conducted and which drains more than one square mile, the permit shall be referred to a registered
professional engineer under the employ or contract of the city for review to ensure that the development
meets section 8-6-7 or 8-6-8 of this chapter.
2. In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall state in writing that the development meets the
requirements of section 8-6-7 of this chapter.
C. Dam Safety Requirements:
1. Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage potential in the event of failure.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 544/767
2. The construction or major modification of all class I (high hazard) and class II (moderate hazard) dams
require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit.
3. Some class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit, depending on the drainage
area to the dam, the height of the dam and the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off channel
detention basins that have an embankment are nonjurisdictional class III dam. It is not required that
IDNR/OWR "sign off" on all nonjurisdictional class III dams.
4. A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a hazard classification and determine if
an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is required.
5. A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the construction or major modification of
jurisdictional dams.
6. Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures.
D. Other Permit Requirements: Ensure any and all required federal, state and local permits are received prior to
the issuance of a floodplain development permit.
E. Plan Review And Permit Issuance:
1. Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the city meet the
requirements of this chapter; and
2. Issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other
regulations of this community when the development meets the conditions of this chapter.
F. Inspection Review:
1. Inspect all development projects before, during and after construction to assure proper elevation of the
structure and to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and
2. Schedule on an annual basis an inspection of the floodplain and document the results of the inspection.
G. Damage Determinations: Make damage determinations of all damaged buildings in the SFHA after a flood to
determine substantially damaged structures which must comply with subsection 8-6-9C3 of this chapter.
H. Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain permit files including:
1. An elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of a residential or
nonresidential building subject to section 8-6-9 of this chapter; and/or
2. The elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate,
for all buildings subject to section 8-6-9 of this chapter.
I. Records For Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA
and designated floodway maps, copies of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation,
conditional letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and "as built" elevation
and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all buildings constructed subject to this chapter.
J. State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by IDNR/OWR, for all development
projects subject to sections 8-6-7 and 8-6-8 of this chapter, unless enforcement responsibility has been
delegated to the city. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the city and shall require
review or permits from IDNR/OWR:

L. Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to administer and enforce the
provisions of this chapter, subject however to the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any
ordinance changes. (Ord. 08-09-0, 3-12-2008)
8-6-5: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for the city. If a base flood elevation or
100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be
according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. When a party disagrees with
the best available data, they shall submit a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with
better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any development of the
site.
A. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of Countryside shall be as delineated on
the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook County prepared by FEMA dated August 19,
2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
B. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook
County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city shall be
as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook County prepared by FEMA
and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be
prepared from time to time.

C. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an "AH zone" or "AO
zone" shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook
County.
D. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A
zone" on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County shall be according to the best existing
data available from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be
financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations.
1. When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HECRAS,
or a dynamic model such as HIP.
2. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HECHMS,
HEC-1, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United
States geological survey for estimating peak flood discharges.
3. For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet (3'),
unless calculated by a detailed engineering study.
4. For an unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than 1 square mile) which has been
identified by the building official or designee pursuant to subsection 8-6-4A3 of this chapter, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved in this subsection D. (Ord.
08-09-0, 3-12-2008)
8-6-6: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of
this chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems.
Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the
requirements of section 8-6-9 of this chapter.
A. Development Permit:
1. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall commence any
development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the building official or
designee.
2. Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the building official or
designee.

a. Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation of the
current flood insurance rate map and which has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood
insurance rate map without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not
subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be
below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but shown on the current flood insurance
rate map is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
b. The building official or designee shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first
flood insurance rate map identification.
4. A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a
description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control
measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final
stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure
postconstruction maintenance.
5. The building official or designee shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other
federal, state, and local permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of activity. The
building official or designee shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have
been obtained.
B. Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and
safety.
1. Submitting Sufficient Data: If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision
(LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
2. Compensatory Storage:
a. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied
by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be
compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the
base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
b. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or
structure.
c. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the
areas so filled or occupied.
d. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the
proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
e. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
C. Construction Of The Lowest Floor Below The Base Flood Elevation (BFE): A person who has obtained a
letter of map revision based on fill that removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of
fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the city to construct the lowest floor of a
residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The building official or designee shall not issue such a
permit unless the applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsections:
1. Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection B2 of this section.
2. The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window wells, accessways) shall be at or
above the flood protection elevation (FPE).
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 548/767
3. The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten
feet (10') beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions are such that this
requirement cannot be met, the building official or designee may waive the ten foot (10') minimum setback
if an Illinois registered professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building
from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a
detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the building official or designee
for review. The building official or designee may require such additional documentation as necessary to
prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall
the setback distance be less than four feet (4').
4. The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of twenty feet (20') from the
structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be
obtained, the building official or designee may waive the twenty foot (20') minimum setback distance if an
Illinois registered professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from
damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design
proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be
submitted to the city for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet (4').
5. The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this subsection and
is at least five feet (5') thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted
to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of an LOMR-F, if such fill consists of
material, including soils of similar classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH,
CL, SC or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, classification of soils for engineering purposes.
6. The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one material, and the
engineering priorities must be in the same direction.
7. All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by an Illinois registered
professional engineer, as warranted by the site conditions.
8. The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five (5) below the BFE.
9. There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of one-fourth (1/4)
horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The
pump shall be rated at four (4) times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and
away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor under the effect of
the seepage pressure.
10. The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow.
11. All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted
engineering practices.
12. If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this
subsection, the building official or designee may allow the construction of a basement below the BFE only
if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set
forth in FEMA technical bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that
the proposed structure is reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering
analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be completed in
accordance with the latest edition of FEMA technical bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being
prepared by an Illinois registered professional engineer.
13. In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no case shall the depth of excavation
in the front and side yards of the lot exceed eighteen inches (18"), as measured from the previously
existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if
necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse or storm
sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area will not be
permitted. (Ord. 08-09-0, 3-12-2008)

B. Preventing Increased Damages And A List Of Appropriate Uses:
1. Development In Floodways: The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate
uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or
potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and
welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or
permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 551/767
appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17
Illinois administrative code part 3708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
a. Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the
control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
b. Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as
pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating,
commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
c. Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
d. Underground and overhead utilities;
e. Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least 50
percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and
including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (4 stall maximum) that will not block flood flows nor
reduce floodway storage;
f. Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures that will not block flood
flows nor reduce floodway storage;
g. Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto;
h. Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
(1) The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed one foot (1.0'); or
(2) The applicant of a short term recreational use facility parking lot formally agrees to restrict access
during overbank flooding events and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access
during all overbank flooding events;
i. Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slope toward a watercourse;
j. Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of
watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential,
commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more
than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered
substantial improvements to the structure;
k. The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building, provided that the outside dimensions
are not increased, and if the building was damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value
before the damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection
elevation;
l. Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the building
below the 100-year frequency flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows including, but not
limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the building is improved
to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial
improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
2. Restrictions On Appropriate Uses: Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any
new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to
accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting
designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use.
3. Criteria For Construction Of An Appropriate Use: Within the designated floodway, the construction of an
appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following
engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 552/767
by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements
of section 8-6-9 of this chapter:
a. Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood Stages Upstream: For appropriate
uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on stream structures or dams, all effective designated
floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the
100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors
shall be taken into consideration:
(1) Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n) (AR2/3) where "n" is Manning's roughness factor,
"A" is the effective flow area of the cross section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted
perimeter. (See Ven Te Chow, "Open Channel Hydraulics", [McGraw-Hill, New York, 1959]).
(2) The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a
recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the
proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a
nonvegetative land cover.
(3) Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated floodway
conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's
engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
(A) When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to
expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded
stream's length.
(B) When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to
contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded
stream's length.
(C) When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical
transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length shall be used.
(D) Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and
contractions and when meeting the designated floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
(E) All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows.
b. Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream Flooding:
(1) Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due to the
proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control
projects.
(2) Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume of
floodplain storage lost.
(3) Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required
to be replaced.
(4) The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal
water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost
below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to
drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
(5) If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the
applicant's engineer shall demonstrate through a determination of flood discharges and water surface
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 553/767
elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
(6) There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless
such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.
c. Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream Erosion Or Flood Heights:
(1) For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will
not result in an increase in the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all
flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
(2) In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in
the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour,
erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
d. Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway Approaches:
(1) The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot
when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of
existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements.
(2) If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer
must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or waiver.
(A) The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows,
and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 8-
6-5 of this chapter. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA
approved hydraulic models.
(B) Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection B3b of this section.
(C) Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection B3c of this section.
(D) If the crossing is proposed over public water that is used for recreational or commercial
navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
(E) The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and
proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not
required by this subsection B.
(F) All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection B3h of this
section.
e. Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts, And Approach Roads:
(1) The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with
no more than 0.1 foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up
to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage.
(2) If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or
structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of
redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on
flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
(3) The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should
be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708
(floodway construction in northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and
concurrence before a permit is issued.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 554/767
f. On Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water:
(1) Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the existing
conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained
within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within
the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements.
(2) A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any
structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
(3) All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section 8-6-2 of this chapter shall meet the
permitting requirements of 17 Illinois administrative code part 3702 (construction and maintenance of
dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an
impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
(A) The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public
recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
(B) The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access
to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning;
(C) The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions.
Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures
and a presedimentation basin;
(D) A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the
effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and
other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality
in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure
comprehensive watershed control;
(E) The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section.
g. Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial Structures:
(1) If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside
perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no farther than ten feet (10') from the
outside of the building.
(2) Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities.
h. Excavation In The Floodway:
(1) When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the
modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost
conveyance or other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
(2) The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can
prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions
may be used with the same efficiency:
(A) When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to
expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded
stream's length; and
(B) When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to
contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded
stream's length; and
(C) When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical
transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length shall be used; and

(D) Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition
sections.
i. Channel Modification Involved: If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be
demonstrated that:
(1) There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less
impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees,
bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain,
clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or
greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and
improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat;
(2) Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the
modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the
replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values;
(3) The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its
adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
(A) The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of
the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been
previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into
channel modification design, where practical.
(B) Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of
the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion.
(C) One sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of stream side
(riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the
shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation.
(D) Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the
channel.
(E) Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than three to one (3:1)
horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the
preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use
of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or riprap are
preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should
be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
(F) All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as
soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall
be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover.
(G) If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and
other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting
areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where
appropriate.
(H) A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce
sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality.
(I) New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including
vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel.
(J) There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for
any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 556/767
increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
(K) Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the
volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and
(4) The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section.
j. Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan
shall be submitted by the applicant.
k. Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling,
and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation
control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
(1) The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible.
Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case
shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days
prior to the initiation of improvements.
(2) Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as
possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is
reached on any portion of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may not be at
final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days.
(3) Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated
on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential
sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and
sediment traps and basins.
(4) A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in width shall be preserved and/or
reestablished, where possible, along existing channels (see subsection B3p of this section).
Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be
constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels
shall be restabilized immediately.
(5) Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent
with "Procedures And Standards For Urban Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control In Illinois" (1988)
also known as the "Green Book" and the "Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
l. Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this
section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and
hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased
flood heights outside the project right of way or easements for all flood events up to and including the
100-year frequency event.
m. General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
(1) The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study, referenced in section
8-6-5 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be
in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on
the appropriate base conditions data to use.
(2) If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by
backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed
construction shall be shown to meet:

frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information,
calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision
and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a
permit is issued.
(2) The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as built plans or record
drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by
FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
(3) In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in
unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated floodway map revision
before IDNR/OWR approval can be given.
(4) No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued.
(5) After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a final letter of
map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
o. Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the
supervision of a registered professional engineer.
p. Construction Within Twenty Five Feet Of Channel: For all activities in the floodway involving
construction within twenty five feet (25') of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:
(1) A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least twenty five feet (25') of the
ordinary high water mark of the channel.
(2) Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a
vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction.
q. Commencement Of Construction: After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway
change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to
change the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that
is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and
a final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance
and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as built" plans.
4. Development Activities In Delegated Communities Requiring State Review: For those projects listed
below located in a designated floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their

completion of re-inspection, it is determined that any violation(s) have not been corrected, the Building
Department may issue an order suspending or denying the issuance of a license. Tenant caused violations
may not be considered grounds for suspension of license as long as the legal owner(s) cooperate in gaining
compliance.

the initial inspection, one re-inspection for each unapproved area shall be scheduled by the legal owner(s)
to occur on a date and time no later than fifteen (15) days after the completion of the initial inspection. In the
event that any area is not approved upon the completion of a re-inspection, the Building Department may, in
its discretion, allow for further re-inspections or may suspend or deny the license at that time.

The building official shall, from time to time, evaluate all buildings in the city he believes to be unoccupied and

11-3 of this chapter. The building official may determine that a building which meets any of the criteria set forth
in section 8-11-3 of this chapter is not to be regulated under this chapter for a stated period, if upon
consideration of reliable, substantiated and sufficient evidence, he or she determines that regulation of the
building under this chapter would not serve the public health, welfare, and safety and makes written findings in
support of his decision. The determination shall be in writing and shall state the factual basis for the
determination. For buildings the building official determines to be "vacant buildings", he shall, within seven (7)
days of making that determination, send notice of his written determination with the factual findings to the last
taxpayer of record listed on the most recent Cook County tax roll.
Said notice of determination shall be sent first class United States mail, with proper postage prepaid. Failure of
delivery shall not excuse a person from complying with this chapter. The building official may personally serve
or cause personal service of the notice of determination.
Any person making such service shall execute an affidavit attesting to the facts of service. The building official

thereof, and shall include all evidence the owner relies upon to support the appeal. The director of

written appeal and the building official's written determination.

days of his or her receipt of the appeal. The director of community development may, but is not required to,

determination having been made, shall set forth specific facts to support nonapplicability in a writing to the
building official. In the event the building official determines that the subject building is a "vacant building",

Title 9
SUBDIVISIONS
Chapter 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
9-1-1: PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 601/767
The need and purpose for establishment of suitable controls for the development of new land areas in and
about our cities has been well stated by the Housing and Home Finance Agency in its publication, "Suggested
Land Subdivision Regulations", and the following is a quotation from that publication:
The regulations of land subdivision for residential and other uses is widely accepted as a function of
municipal and county government in the United States. It has become widely recognized as a method of
insuring sound community growth and the safeguarding of the interests of the homeowner, the subdivider, and
the local government. The business of building a city, and this includes its environs, requires the safeguarding
of these interests and the assurance that residential land subdivision will provide permanent assets to the
locality. A large part of land subdivision and development continues to occur in unincorporated areas, and so
the regulations of land subdivision is of as great a concern to unincorporated areas as it is to incorporated
areas.
Subdivision regulations should prevent excessive governmental operating costs. At the same time, they
should assure to the maximum degree possible the means whereby land can be developed for the highest
possible use with all of the necessary protections against deterioration and obsolescence.
Regulations for control of land subdivision are instruments of local government which require the greatest
amount of cooperation between the landowner who wishes to subdivide and the municipality or county within
which such subdivision is to take place. This manual is intended to provide common grounds of understanding
and a sound working relationship for both the government officials interested in and responsible for sound
community development and the landowner who intends to subdivide for whatever purpose.
The subdivision of land is a technical and business venture which not only affects the immediate return to the
investor in land and the value of the land on which he may wish to build, but it also involves for the local
government specific items of cost and income for the years to come which must be weighed at the time that a
subdivision is under consideration.
This publication is expected to help guide the preparation of the regulations which a locality may wish to
adopt. It covers the technical elements of land subdivision control designed to assure the maximum return on
the local government's investment, and at the same time to assure the subdivider full consideration of his
interests and responsibilities.
In order to understand the objectives of subdivision control regulations, it is first necessary to recognize that
a wide variety of interests are concerned and that these interests will vary in intensity from community to
community and in relation to different subdivision proposals within a community. Brief consideration of some of
those interests and their relation to each other will facilitate the use of this manual.
THE LANDOWNER OR DEVELOPER
A subdivision proposal or project is initiated by the owner of the land or by a builder-developer or real estate
operator who has a financial interest in the development, sale or lease of the subdivision in whole or in part.
Such sale or lease involves business transactions between the subdivider and his client and the subdivider and
the local government. While the financing of such business transactions may take an infinite number of forms,
the ultimate objective is the same: the disposal of the subdivided land at a profit to the owner or developer.
Therefore it is mandatory that subdivision regulations recognize the fundamental financial interests of both the
seller and the purchaser and that such regulations do not impose undue hardships which would impair land
salability.
THE INVESTOR
The investor in land may be an individual purchaser of one or more lots, a mortgage bank, an insurance
company, or an agency of the Federal Government which acquires financial interest, either through mortgage
insurance or other means. It is to the interest of these investors that the subdivision is not only financially
feasible, but that there should be a certain guarantee of the continuing success of the project in order that there
may be a continued return on the investment and in order that satisfactory interest rates and amortization
charges may be levied. It is important to recognize also that generally the life of a subdivision is as long as the
life of a city and that, during this indefinite and extensive period of years, properties are continually changing
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 602/767
hands and investments are continually being made in land and buildings. It is to the community's best interests,
including the interests of both private enterprise and local government, to see that every subdivision is so well
designed and constructed that it does not ultimately become a charge against the community and that it does
not become a liability instead of an asset, thus adversely affecting the local tax base.
One of the errors committed in the past by local governments in the management of the subdivision
development process has been the lack of recognition of the long-term responsibilities involved in the platting of
land and the laying out of streets and other facilities and services. A quick sale may provide for a quick profit to
the subdivider. However, this gain may be offset by the cost to the community of installing facilities that require
increased taxation.
The wise real estate operator, investor and public official will take these matters into consideration from the
very beginning.
THE HOMEOWNER
To the homeowner, sound subdivision regulations provide a protection of his special interest from the
beginning. The safeguarding of the character of a development, through provisions of adequate block design,
street layout, lot layout, and the provision of adequate utilities and community services, supplies a stability to
the value of the homeowner's investment and safeguards his family life. Too often we have seen evidences of
deterioration of neighborhoods because of bad platting and inadequate subdivision and zoning protection.
As the costs of municipal management rise, it becomes more and more important that we provide means of
stabilizing residential values. The constant movement of people from one neighborhood to another and the loss
of value can be minimized by the development of sound and attractive neighborhoods.
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT INTERESTS
There are several governmental officials responsible for an interest in land subdivision in every community.
There is no attempt here to provide an exhaustive listing. However, it is essential to indicate wherein
responsibilities may lie and where there will be interest in the use of this manual. Both in the drafting of
subdivision regulations and in their administration it is important, of course, for local government interests to
exercise judgment and care in order to assure that all their standards and requirements are appropriate. In all
cases these standards should be reasonable and equitable in the interest of the developer, investor and
homeowner, as well as the local government.
(Ord. 69-24-0)

4. No plat will be approved for a subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding or which contains poor
drainage facilities and which would make adequate drainage of the lots and streets impossible. However,

area completely safe for residential occupancy and provide adequate lot and street drainage, the
preliminary plat of the subdivision may be approved.

Development Department and revised as of March 14, 2018 which map is made a part hereof by reference.
Said map is hereby adopted as the official zoning map of the City of Countryside, and it shall have the same

thereon, was fully set forth and described herein. Such map shall continue to be the official zoning map of the
City until amended or superseded by action of the City Council. (Ord. 18-07-0, 3-14-2018)
10-4-3: INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:
When uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts as shown on the zoning map, the
following rules shall apply:
A. District boundary lines are either the centerlines of railroads, highways, streets, alleys or easements, or the
boundary lines of section, quarter-sections, divisions of section, tracts of lots, or such lines extended, unless
otherwise indicated.
B. In areas not subdivided into lots and blocks, wherever a district is indicated as a strip adjacent to and
paralleling a street or highway, the depth of such strips shall be in accordance with the dimensions shown
on the map measured at right angles from the centerline of the street or highway, and the length of frontage
shall be in accordance with dimensions shown on the map from section, quarter-section, or division lines or
centerlines of streets, highways or railroad rights-of-way unless otherwise indicated.
C. Where a lot held in one ownership and of record on the effective date of the ordinance is divided by a district
boundary line, the entire lot shall be construed to be within the less restricted district, provided that this
construction shall not apply if it increases the less restricted frontage of the lot by more than twenty five feet
(25'). (Ord. 80-2-0, 12-1979; amd. 1986 Code)
10-4-4: ZONING OF PUBLIC WAYS, WATERWAYS AND RAILROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY:
All streets, alleys, public ways, waterways and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated,
shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting on such alleys, streets, public
ways and railroad rights-of-way or waterways. Where the centerline of a street, alley, public way, waterway or
railroad right of way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically
designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline. (Ord. 80-2-0,
12-1979; amd. 1986 Code)
10-4-5: ZONING OF ANNEXED LANDS:
Prior to the annexation of any territory to the city, the owner of the property to be annexed may submit a request
to the city council for preannexation zoning of said property. Upon submission of such a request, the city council
shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois municipal code1. If no preannexation
zoning hearing is held, all properties annexed to the city shall automatically be classified as the most restrictive
zoning district which would still permit the current uses which are upon the property on the date of annexation
or until otherwise classified by amendment. (Ord. 99-12-0, 3-10-1999)

OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING
10-10-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to alleviate or prevent congestion of the public streets and so promote the safety
and welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for the off street parking and loading and
unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which property is put. (Ord. 89-39-0, 10-11-1989)
10-10-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. Scope Of Regulations: The off street parking and loading provisions herein shall apply as follows:
1. For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established after the effective date of this title,
accessory parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the district in
which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a building permit has been issued prior to the
effective date of this title, and provided that construction is begun within one year of such effective date
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 718/767
and diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities as required hereinafter need not be
provided.
2. When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises shall be increased through addition of
dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or other units of measurement specified herein for
required parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for
such increase in intensity of use.
However, no building or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully established prior to the effective date
hereof shall be required to provide such additional parking or loading facilities unless and until the
aggregate increase in units of measurement shall equal not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the units of
measurement existing upon the effective date of this title, in which event parking or loading facilities as
required herein shall be provided for the total increase.
3. Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or
loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. However, if the said building or structure
was erected prior to the effective date of this title, additional parking or loading facilities are mandatory
only in the amount by which the requirements for the new use would exceed those for the existing use if
the latter were subject to the parking and loading provisions herein.
B. Existing Parking And Loading Facilities: Accessory off street parking or loading facilities which are located on
the same lot as the building or use served and which were in existence on the effective date of this title or
were provided voluntarily after such effective date, shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less
than, shall not further be reduced below, the requirements of this title for a similar new building or use.
C. Permissive Parking And Loading Facilities: Nothing in this title shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary
establishment of off street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings provided
that all regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement and operation of such facilities are
adhered to.
D. Damage Or Destruction: For any conforming or legally nonconforming building or use which is in existence
on the effective date of this title which, subsequent thereto, is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse,
explosion or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off street parking or loading
facilities need not be provided except that parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the
time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case shall it
be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this title for
equivalent new uses or construction.
E. Control Of Off Site Parking Facilities: When required parking facilities are provided on land other than the
zoning lot on which the building or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the
same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking
facilities are accessory. No such off site parking facilities shall be authorized and no occupancy permit shall
be issued where the plans call for parking facilities other than on the same zoning lot until and unless the
board of appeals has reviewed the plans and heard the applicant and made findings that the common
ownership or possession of the zoning lot and the site of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to
continue and that the off site parking facilities will be maintained at all times during the life of the proposed
use or building.
F. Submission Of Plat Plan: Any application for a building permit or for a certificate of occupancy, where no
building permit is required, shall include therewith a plat plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned,
showing any parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this title. (Ord. 89-39-0, 10-11-

26-2012)
10-10-8-5: MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS:
In the event that satisfying all of the requirements of this section 10-10-8 would be infeasible due to the unique
nature of the site, or cause an unintended consequence that undermines the purpose of this section 10-10-8, a
property owner (or designee) may submit a written request to the building commissioner for a modification of
the requirements of this section 10-10-8. The request shall state the specific reason(s) for the request, provide

10-10-8-6: ABANDONED BICYCLES:

A. Definitions: The definitions set forth in section 10-10-8-2 of this chapter shall apply to this section, unless the
context clearly requires otherwise.
B. Removal Requirements: On a quarterly basis, owners of property subject to this section 10-10-8 (or a

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 738/767
A. Notice And Posting Of Sign: The plan commission-zoning board shall fix a reasonable time and place for the
public hearing and shall give notice of the time and place of the public hearing, published at least once, not
more than thirty (30) days and not less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing, in one or more newspapers
published in the city, or if no newspaper is published therein, then in one or more newspapers with a general
circulation in the city. In addition, within the same time period required herein for published notice, the
zoning administrator shall cause to be posted upon the premises which will be the subject of such hearing a
sign bearing the following words:
THIS PROPERTY IS SUBJECT TO A REQUEST FOR ZONING VARIATION AND/OR ZONING
RECLASSIFICATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, CALL THE OFFICE OF THE CITY CLERK, 354-
7270. THIS NOTICE IS POSTED PURSUANT TO ORDINANCE ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF
THE CITY OF COUNTRYSIDE, ILLINOIS.
Said sign shall be placed in a location calculated to be seen by the largest number of persons possible.
However, the zoning administrator shall have the sole discretion with regard to such location, and the fact
that such notice was not seen by any particular individual shall not be the basis for reversing any decision of
the plan commission-zoning board with regard to an authorized variation. The decision of the plan
commission-zoning board granting or denying an authorized variation shall be final, subject to the provisions

section, provided such application is accompanied by written consents to such variation signed by the
owners of record of each parcel of property having a common boundary line with the real estate for which
the variation is sought. (Ord. 98-15-0, 4-8-1998)
10-12-4-6: SPECIAL USE VARIATIONS:
A. Purpose: The development and execution of a zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the city into
districts within which districts the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and
structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are uses
which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or
districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the
public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such uses fall into two (2) categories:
1. Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest;
2. Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to
unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
B. Initiation Of Special Use: Any person owning or having an interest in the subject property may file an
application to use such land for one or more of the special uses provided for in this title in the zoning district
in which the land is situated.
C. Application For Special Use: An application for a special use shall be filed with the zoning administrator upon
a form prescribed by said zoning administrator. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or
data prescribed by the zoning administrator and shall include a statement in writing by the applicant and
adequate evidence showing that the proposed use variation will conform to the standards set forth herein.

D. Hearings On Application And Notice: Upon receipt, in proper form, of the application and statement referred
to in subsection C of this section, the plan commission-zoning board shall fix a reasonable time and place
for the public hearing and shall give notice of the time and place of the public hearing, published at least
once, not more than thirty (30) days and not less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing, in one or more
newspapers published within the city, or if no newspaper is published therein, then in one or more
newspapers with a general circulation within the city. In addition, within the same time period required herein
for published notice, the zoning administrator shall cause to be posted upon the premises which will be the
subject of such hearing a sign bearing the following words:
THIS PROPERTY IS SUBJECT TO A REQUEST FOR ZONING VARIATION AND/OR ZONING
RECLASSIFICATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, CALL THE OFFICE OF THE CITY CLERK, 354-
7270. THIS NOTICE IS POSTED PURSUANT TO ORDINANCE ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF
THE CITY OF COUNTRYSIDE, ILLINOIS.
Said sign shall be placed in a location calculated to be seen by the largest number of persons possible.
However, the zoning administrator shall have sole discretion with regard to such location, and the fact that
such notice was not seen by any particular individual shall not be the basis for reversing any decision of the
plan commission-zoning board with regard to a requested variation. The decision of the plan commissionzoning
board granting or denying a variation shall be final, subject to the provisions of the administrative
review act. (Ord. 98-15-0, 4-8-1998)
E. Authorization: For each application for a special use variation, the plan commission-zoning board shall report
to the city council its findings and recommendations, including the stipulations or additional conditions and
guarantees that such conditions will be complied with when they are deemed necessary to the protection of
the public interest. The city council may grant or deny any application for a use variation; provided, however,
that when the plan commission-zoning board recommends denial of an application, the city council may
approve the application only by a favorable vote of the city council. (Ord. 03-02-0, 1-8-2003)
F. Standards: No special use variation shall be recommended by the plan commission-zoning board unless said
plan commission-zoning board shall find: (Ord. 98-15-0, 4-8-1998)
1. That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the use will not be detrimental to or endanger the
public safety, health, morals, comfort or general welfare;
2. That the use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for
the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
neighborhood;

of surrounding property for uses permitted in the district;
4. That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been or are being

located, except as such regulations may in each instance be modified by the city council, pursuant to the
recommendations of the plan commission-zoning board. (Ord. 98-15-0, 4-8-1998)
10-12-4-7: CONDITIONS AND GUARANTEES:
Prior to the granting of any special use variation, the plan commission-zoning board may recommend and the
city council shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction,

maintenance and operation of the special use variation as deemed necessary for the protecting of the public
interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified herein. In all cases in which
special use variations are granted, the City Council shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem
necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be complied with.
(Ord. 98-15-0, 4-8-1998)
10-12-4-8: EFFECT OF DENIAL OF A USE VARIATION:
No application for a special use variation which has been denied in whole or in part by the City Council shall be

evidence or proof of changed conditions found to be valid by the Plan Commission-Zoning Board and the City
Council. (Ord. 98-15-0, 4-8-1998)
10-12-4-9: REVOCATION:
In any case where a special use variation has not been established within one year after the date of granting
thereof, then without further action by the Plan Commission-Zoning Board or the City Council, the special use
variation authorization shall be null and void. (Ord. 98-15-0, 4-8-1998)

and effect if a building permit for said erection or alteration is obtained within such period and such erection
or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.
B. No order for a use variation permitting a use of a building or premises shall be valid for a period longer than

alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit. (Ord. 80-2-0,
12-1979)
10-12-4-11: ABANDONMENT OF SPECIAL USE VARIATION:
The continuous nonuse of a special use variation for a period of six (6) months or more shall constitute
abandonment thereof, and the activity permitted by such use may not again be reestablished without issuance
of a new special use permit pursuant to the procedures established therefor. (Ord. 93-44-0, 12-8-1993)
10-12-5: RESERVED:
(Ord. 98-15-0, 4-8-1998)
10-12-6: APPLICATION FOR RELIEF FROM PLAN COMMISSION-ZONING BOARD;
PROCEDURE:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 741/767
An application for relief from the requirements of this Title to the Plan Commission-Zoning Board such as, but
not limited to, a Zoning Code amendment, special use permit, zoning variation or appeal from a decision of the
Zoning Administrator, shall be made and processed in accordance with the following procedures:
A. Application To Be Filed With City Clerk: All applications for relief from the Plan Commission-Zoning Board
shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk of the City of Countryside during normal business hours, and shall
be accompanied by all required supporting documents and by the required nonrefundable filing fee. (Ord.
98-15-0, 4-8-1998)
B. Review By Zoning Administrator/Building Commissioner: Upon receipt of an application, which is in apparent
conformity with all of the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, all supporting documents and the required
fee, the City Clerk's office shall refer the application to the Zoning Administrator/Building Commissioner who,
within twenty four (24) hours from receipt of such application, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted,
shall examine the same, note his or her approval or disapproval thereon and return such application to the
office of the City Clerk.
In all cases, when the Zoning Administrator/Building Commissioner disapproves an application, he shall
note on the face thereof or upon any other sheet attached thereto "REJECTED" and the reasons for such
rejection. However, approval or rejection by the Zoning Administrator/Building Commissioner shall be only
for the purpose of informing the office of the City Clerk whether the application appears to be in conformity
with all application requirements of the Zoning Ordinance; approval shall not be construed as a
recommendation that the relief requested should be allowed, and it shall not be construed as curing any
defect which may later be found in the application. Approval by the zoning administrator/building
commissioner shall not relieve the applicant of the responsibility of meeting all application requirements, and
the city shall not be liable for errors or omissions on the part of the zoning administrator/building
commissioner in approving or rejecting any application, nor shall it be estopped from enforcing any provision
of the zoning ordinance or other ordinance of the city, notwithstanding erroneous approval of such
application by the zoning administrator/building commissioner. (Ord. 84-4-0, 2-8-1984)
C. Applications: Applications shall be on forms prescribed from time to time by the city and supplied by the city
clerk's office. Each application shall contain information and be accompanied by such supporting documents
as are required from time to time by the city, including, but not limited to, those prescribed in section 10-12-
4, "Variations", and subsection 10-12-4-6C, "Application For Special Use", of this chapter, when appropriate.
In addition, and subject to the exceptions hereafter stated, in all cases where the zoning relief applied for will
involve new building construction or an addition to existing construction, excavation or other activity that will
materially affect existing contours of land, the applicant shall submit as a part of his application a preliminary
drainage plan showing all existing land features and applicant's proposed system for storm water
management, including approximate size and location of storm water discharge and location of detention
facilities where required. All preliminary drainage plans shall conform with all applicable governmental storm
water requirements. Each such preliminary drainage plan shall be transmitted by the clerk's office to the city
engineer for his determination that the preliminary drainage plan complies with all city and other applicable
regulations. If the preliminary drainage plan is not in conformity with any applicable regulations of the city or
other governmental agency, or if in the opinion of the city engineer the proposed drainage plan would cause
flooding or other hazard to, or be otherwise detrimental to, the subject premises or any adjoining or
surrounding land, the preliminary drainage plan shall be revised as required to conform with such applicable
regulations or to otherwise be in accordance with the direction of the city engineer. No application shall be
placed on the agenda of the plan commission-zoning board for hearing unless and until it is approved by the
city engineer.
In all cases where a preliminary drainage plan is required, the cost of the city engineer's review shall be paid
by the applicant at the time the application is submitted, and no application shall be accepted without such
payment.
The above requirements for a preliminary drainage plan shall not apply when application for zoning relief

involves construction of a single-family residence, an addition to a single-family residence, or does not
otherwise involve an excavation or other material disturbance of existing contours of land. (Ord. 04-40-0, 10-
27-2004)
D. Hearing Set By City Clerk: Upon return of an application from the zoning administrator/building
commissioner bearing his or her approval, the city clerk's office shall schedule a hearing on the application
at the earliest possible regular meeting of the plan commission-zoning board giving consideration to the time
necessary for preparation of the required notice for hearing, transmission of the notice to a newspaper for
publication, and the number of days which must expire between publication of the notice and the hearing.
In addition, the city clerk's office shall notify the chairman and each member of the plan commission-zoning
board of the hearing date by mailing or delivering to him or her a copy of the notice of hearing to be
published and a copy of the application which is to be considered. The city clerk's office shall also notify the
applicant of the date, time and place of the hearing by mail sent to his or her address which appears on the
application. (Ord. 98-15-0, 4-8-1998; amd. Ord. 04-40-0, 10-27-2004)
E. Rejected Applications: If the city clerk's office receives an application which has been rejected by the zoning
administrator/building commissioner, the clerk's office shall forthwith return the application, along with all
supporting documents, either by personal delivery or by mailing to the applicant at his or her address which
appears on the application.
F. Amended Applications: The applicant whose application has been rejected may cure such defect or defects
which caused the rejection and refile the same with the city clerk's office. The city clerk's office shall then
proceed to process the application in the same manner as an original application.
No amended application which is rejected shall again be refiled. However, the applicant may file a new
application, for the same relief as requested in the original application, upon the applicant paying the filing
fee due for an original application. (Ord. 84-4-0, 2-8-1984; amd. Ord. 04-40-0, 10-27-2004)
10-12-7: STAY OF PROCEEDINGS:
The appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the zoning administrator
certifies to the plan commission-zoning board, after notice of appeal has been filed with him or her, that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property; in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the plan commission-zoning board or by a court of record on application, with notice to the officer
from whom the appeal is taken and all due causes shown. (Ord. 98-15-0, 4-8-1998)

Chapter 13
REGULATION OF WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS
TOWERS AND ANTENNAS
10-13-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless communications towers
and antennas. The goals of this chapter are to: a) protect residential areas and land uses from potential
adverse impacts of towers and antennas; b) encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas; c)
minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; d) strongly encourage the joint use of new and
existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single use towers; e) encourage
users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal; f) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes
the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and
innovative camouflaging techniques; g) enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; h) consider the public health and
safety of communication towers; and i) avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through
engineering and careful siting of tower structures. In furtherance of these goals, city of Countryside shall give
due consideration to the city's master plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas
in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas. (Ord. 01-05-0, 3-14-2001, eff. 4-13-2001)

a. Height of the proposed tower;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 749/767
b. Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries;
c. Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
d. Surrounding topography;
e. Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
f. Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
g. Proposed ingress and egress; and
h. Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technologies not requiring the use
of towers or structures, as discussed in subsection B3 of this section.
3. Availability Of Suitable Existing Towers, Other Structures, Or Alternative Technology: No new tower shall
be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the plan commissionzoning
board that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the use of
towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit
information requested by the plan commission-zoning board related to the availability of suitable existing
towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing
tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may
consist of any of the following:
a. No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area which meet applicant's
engineering requirements.
b. Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
c. Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed
antenna and related equipment.
d. The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the
existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
e. The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or
structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new
tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
f. The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and
structures unsuitable.
g. The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or
structures, such as a cable microcell network using multiple low powered transmitters/receivers
attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or
antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable.
4. Setbacks: The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers for which a special use permit is
required; provided, however, that the plan commission-zoning board may reduce the standard setback
requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby:
a. Towers and antennas must be set back a distance at least equal to the height of the tower from any lot
line.
b. Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
5. Separation: The following separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a
special use permit is required; provided, however, that the plan commission-zoning board may reduce the

12. Any other documentation requirements including elevations, cross sections and other plan details
deemed appropriate by the city.
C. Design Guidelines: In preparing landscape plans, the following shall be followed:
1. General Landscape Design Principles:
a. Landscape improvements should serve to integrate the project to the site, with particular sensitivity to
the natural topography, watercourses, and existing vegetation. Preservation of the existing landscape
material and landforms shall be taken into account, particularly where mature trees are a part of the
site. This is of particular importance in cases where specimen trees, groves, or tree lines, or tree lined
watercourses are present.
b. Landscape improvements should serve to enhance the appearance of the site, especially as viewed
from an adjacent public right of way. Effective year round screening shall be provided to lessen the
visual prominence of: parking lots, service yards, loading docks, public utility structures, and unsightly
appurtenances.
c. Innovative landscape design proposals that promote sustainability, reduce irrigation requirements, and
that utilize effective on site stormwater management techniques are encouraged. Thoughtful selection
and placement of plant material and ground covers based on ecological principles are also encouraged.
d. The aesthetic aspect of landscape improvements shall be considered both at installation and maturity.
Groupings of trees or other plantings are recommended for optimal visual effect and ease of
maintenance.
2. Scale: Scale and nature of landscape materials and planting bed size should be appropriate to the site
and structures. Larger buildings and sites may accommodate and be enhanced by larger plant material,
plant groupings, and planting beds.
3. Selection And Layout: Plant material shall be selected for its form, texture, color and concern for its size
at maturity. Wherever possible, large planting areas shall be provided in groupings and masses to provide
a more naturalistic appearance. Wherever appropriate, use of native woody and herbaceous plant
materials is encouraged. In small planting areas within parking lots, trees and shrubs shall be planted in
groups with massing appropriate to and in harmony with buildings, circulation, stormwater management,
and neighboring landscapes. Energy conservation shall also be considered when determining layout of
selection and layout of plant material. For instance, sun tolerant plant materials should be placed on the
south and west sides of buildings to provide shade from summer sun, and shade tolerant plant materials
should be concentrated on the north side of buildings to dissipate the effects of winter winds.
4. Stormwater Infiltration And Enhanced Water Quality: Wherever possible, preserve, restore, and integrate
natural drainage patterns and features including swales, filter strips, and wetlands or rain gardens
vegetated with native plant systems. The intention shall be to slow stormwater runoff, increase on site
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 759/767
infiltration, and filter suspended solids and contaminants in support of on site stormwater management
and treatment strategies that reduce or control costs to the community.
5. Berming: Earthen berms and existing topography shall, whenever practical, be incorporated into the
landscape treatment of a site. Bermed areas shall be designed to resemble natural landforms, whenever
possible. The maximum permissible slope is four to one (4:1).
6. Facade Treatments: Landscape improvements shall be provided to enhance architectural features and to
add visual interest adjacent to large expanses of building walls. Landscape improvements shall also be
provided as a buffer between pedestrian and vehicular activity at primary building entrances and along
building facades.
7. Fence Treatments: When fencing is used, provide landscaping which includes a variety of plant material,
height, color and texture. This landscaping should buffer, soften or minimize the visual monotony of long
expanses of fencing.
8. Miscellaneous Screening Standards: Functional activities within and adjoining the development site must
be considered in the design of the landscape improvements, including consideration of the following: trash
dumpsters or other waste receptacles, all utility equipment, dish antennas, loading docks or other outdoor
service areas and ground signs. Particular attention shall be paid towards screening mechanical
equipment, air conditioning units, or any other visible outside equipment, service areas, including
dumpster enclosures, loading docks, and bicycle parking areas. Enhance walkways, entrances, seating
areas, bus stops or any other pedestrian areas; separate and buffer pedestrian and public areas from
circulation drives and parking areas; and direct attention to focal areas and main entrances.
9. Miscellaneous Placement Standards: There shall be a three foot (3') radius free of trees or shrubs around
fire hydrants, valve vaults, hose bibs, manholes, hydrants, fire department connections, and other site
features as deemed necessary by the city. Additionally, plant material branching higher than two feet (2')
and lower than six feet (6') above top of curb shall not be planted or maintained in a sight visibility triangle
as defined by the superintendent of public works or his/her designee.
10. Texture: Plants differ in texture according to foliage, color, size and density. A variety of textures will add
interest and depth to the landscape design. For example, coarser plants (larger leaves, dense foliage)
may work to "anchor corners", medium textured materials can gradually transition to fine textured plants.
In massing, coarser textured plants are usually more effective when placed at greater distances from
common viewing locations. Groups of finer textured plants are typically more effective near walkways and
entrances and in courtyards of buildings or plazas.
11. Form: Among the most important design qualities of a plant is form, which includes columnar, round,
vase, weeping, pyramidal and oval forms. Plants of contrasting shapes may provide variety and interest
by accenting a group of plants of another form. Evergreen trees exhibit pyramidal forms, while many
crabapples are round to oval. Plantings that combine two (2) or more forms may effectively buffer or
"soften" building facades, fences, and other structures. The dominant use of native trees and shrubs that
display strongly horizontal branch patterns and "layered" flowering forms is basic to effective use of the
unified "prairie style", associated historically and ecologically with this region, and is encouraged.
12. Color: Color can be used to unify or contrast plantings on a site. It is essential to consider the varying
colors exhibited by a plant in all seasons. Most importantly, through the use of perennials and/or annuals,
color can be used to call attention to entryways and other focal points.
13. Repetition: A design is tied together through the repeated use of a small number of plant species, sizes,
colors, forms, or textures throughout the site. Too much repetition can result in monotony, so it is
important to find a balance. Natural landscaping techniques using a diverse palette of randomly mixed
prairie forbs and grasses will provide repetition and unity throughout the planting area and across the
seasons. On smaller sites it is recommended to keep the plant palette short and simple.
14. Massing: Massing ties in with scale and repetition. In general, shrubs, perennials and annuals are
massed or grouped together to achieve a more dramatic effect. For example, large sites may have shrubs
in groupings of one hundred (100) or more. Large buildings and sites are complemented with larger
material and greater massing of shrubs and/or color.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=502 760/767
15. Variety: Variety adds interest and liveliness to the design. It provides a few unlike qualities to contrast
with those qualities that are alike and duplicated as part of repetition. Variety is achieved through the use
of different forms, textures, colors and plants. (Ord. 06-12-0, 3-22-2006)
10-15-3-5: LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING:
