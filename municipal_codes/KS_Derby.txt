PREFACE 
    The Derby, Kansas Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1975, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement 8, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 8, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2370, passed November 13, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06 can be added between Chapter 2.04 and Chapter 2.08. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 8, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 8, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

Chapter 5.32 - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 
Sections: 

5.32.010 - Findings regarding secondary effects. 
    Whereas, the city of Derby, Kansas (the "city of Derby") has determined that the regulation of public nudity and adult cabarets and adult entertainment establishments (hereafter collectively referred to as sexually oriented business activities), as these terms are hereafter defined, will protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city and will minimize the secondary effects associated with such activities; and 
    Whereas, based upon the legislative findings discussed herein and recent court cases recognizing the secondary effects of public nudity and sexually oriented business activities, and the city's familiarity with the problems associated with these secondary effects within Sedgwick County and other areas throughout the country, the city finds that the continued regulation of public nudity and sexually oriented business activities furthers the goal of protecting the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city of Derby, and minimizes the secondary effects of such activities; and 
    Whereas, the city of Derby desires to minimize and control these secondary effects and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; to protect citizens from increased crime; to preserve the quality of life; to preserve property values; to preserve the character of the city of Derby's neighborhoods and to deter the spread of blight; and 
    Whereas, the city of Derby has an important governmental interest in combating the secondary effects associated with public nudity and sexually oriented business activities, and has the constitutional power to combat these secondary effects; and 
    Whereas, as summarized below, the city of Derby has reviewed and analyzed numerous reports, studies, judicial decisions and the experience and legislative findings of other counties and municipalities around the country concerning the impacts, or secondary effects, of public nudity and sexually oriented business activities on the areas in which such activities are located or take place; and 
    Whereas, the Supreme Court of the United States has held in City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., that cities may rely on relevant studies and evidence from other cities as the basis for action taken to ensure the public order and combat the secondary effects associated with public nudity and sexually oriented business activities; and 
    Whereas, the Supreme Court of the United States has held in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., and city of Erie v. Pap's A.M., tdba "Candyland," that a governing body may prohibit nudity in public places to combat these secondary effects; and 
    Whereas, the Supreme Court of the United States in city of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., reaffirmed its earlier holdings that a municipal government may permissibly regulate the negative secondary effects associated with sexually oriented business activities; and 
    Whereas, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, in cases such as Heideman v. South Salt Lake City, has continued to recognize the negative secondary effects (as summarized below) created by sexually oriented business activities; and 
    Whereas, public nudity and sexually oriented business activities can cause or contribute significantly to increases in criminal activity in the areas in which they are located, including increased incidents of unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and inappropriate intimate conduct between sexually oriented business employees and patrons, violent acts such as assault and battery, sexual harassment, unlawful drug activities, and disorderly conduct, thereby taxing crime prevention and law enforcement resources; and 
    Whereas, sexually oriented business activities and public nudity can cause or contribute significantly to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods, can impair the character and quality of such neighborhoods and the housing located within such neighborhoods, and can inhibit the proper maintenance and growth of such neighborhoods, limiting or reducing the availability of quality, affordable housing for area residents and reducing the value of property in such areas; and 
    Whereas, public nudity and sexually oriented business activities can undermine the stability of other established business and commercial uses in the areas in which sexually oriented business activities occur and can cause or contribute significantly to the deterioration of such other businesses and commercial uses, thereby causing or contributing to a decline in such uses, an inhibition of business and commercial growth and development, and a resulting adverse impact on local government revenues and property values; and 
    Whereas, public nudity and sexually oriented business activities can have a distracting influence on minors and students attending schools, can diminish or destroy the enjoyment and family atmosphere of persons using parks, playgrounds and other public recreational areas, and can interfere with or even destroy the spiritual experience of persons attending church, synagogue, or other places of worship; and 
    Whereas, the presence of sexually oriented business activities is perceived by the public generally and by neighboring business owners and residents as an indication that the area and the quality of life in the area in which such activities occur is in decline and deteriorating, a perception that can lead quickly to such decline and deterioration, prompting businesses and residents to flee the affected area to avoid the consequences of such decline and deterioration; and 
    Whereas, the conduct of sexually oriented business activities, including specifically, but without limitation, the operation and use of adult booths and similar establishments, often encourages or allows sexual activities that place employees and patrons of such businesses at risk to exposure and contraction of sexually transmitted diseases, including specifically, but without limitation, the HIV virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and venereal diseases; and 
    Whereas, public nudity can increase crime, especially crimes of a sexual nature, increase risk of public exposure to sexually transmitted diseases and other pathogens borne by human blood and bodily fluids, and can cause the degradation of the aesthetic and commercial character of neighborhoods, the depression of property values and the degradation of the quality of life for the citizenry; and 
    Whereas, prior to the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the city received and analyzed extensive information concerning the secondary effects of public nudity and sexually oriented businesses has on cities, counties and other public entities.

    Whereas, the city has determined that public nudity and sexually oriented business activities will, unless properly regulated, have these and other severe adverse impacts and secondary effects on the city and its residents; and 
    Whereas, the city has determined that the regulations within this chapter on the operation, maintenance, and other aspects of sexually oriented business activities and the prohibition of public nudity, are necessary to minimize to the greatest extent possible, or to eliminate altogether, the public health risks that customarily exist in connection with such activities; and 
    Whereas, the city has also determined that the regulations within this chapter, including but not limited to, the licensing and distance requirements for sexually oriented business activities, as well as the prohibition on public nudity, are necessary in order to achieve the goal of combating the secondary effects (described above) associated with public nudity and sexually oriented business activities; and 
    Whereas, it is not the intent of the city to suppress any free expression protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the societal evils of public nudity and sexually oriented business activities and the related secondary effects thereto, with only incidental restrictions upon protected expression.

E.  The court may establish the terms and time for payment of any fines, fees, assessments and costs imposed pursuant to this section. Any assessment and costs shall be required to be paid not later than ninety days after imposed, and any remainder of the fine shall be paid prior to the final release of the defendant by the court. 
F.  In lieu of payment of a fine imposed pursuant to this section, the court may order that the person perform community service specified by the court.

1.  The alcohol concentration in the person's blood or breath, as shown by any competent evidence, including other competent evidence, as defined in K.S.A. 8-1013(f)(1), and amendments thereto, is 0.04 or more; 
2.  The alcohol concentration in the person's blood or breath, as measured within three hours of the time of driving a commercial motor vehicle, is 0.04 or more; or 
3.  Committing a violation of subsection A. of Section 10.04.029 of this chapter which prohibits any of the acts prohibited thereunder or is otherwise comparable. 
B.  1.  Driving a commercial motor vehicle under the influence is: 
i.  An ordinance violation. On a first conviction, the person convicted shall be sentenced to not less than forty-eight consecutive hours nor more than six months' imprisonment, or in the court's discretion, one hundred hours of public service, and fined not less than seven hundred fifty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. The person convicted shall serve at least forty-eight consecutive hours' imprisonment or one hundred hours of public service either before or as a condition of any grant of probation, suspension or reduction of sentence or parole or other release; 
ii.  On a second conviction, the person convicted shall be sentenced to not less than ninety days nor more than one year's imprisonment and fined not less than one thousand two hundred fifty dollars nor more than one thousand seven hundred fifty dollars. The person convicted shall serve at least five consecutive days' imprisonment before the person is granted probation, suspension or reduction of sentence or parole or is otherwise released. The five days' imprisonment mandated by this subsection may be served in a work release program only after such person has served forty-eight consecutive hours' imprisonment, provided such work release program requires such person to return to confinement at the end of each day in the work release program. The person convicted, if placed into a work release program, shall serve a minimum of one hundred twenty hours of confinement. Such one hundred twenty hours of confinement shall be a period of at least forty-eight consecutive hours of imprisonment followed by confinement hours at the end of and continuing to the beginning of the offender's work day. The court may place the person convicted under a house arrest program to serve the five days' imprisonment mandated by this section only after such person has served forty-eight consecutive hours' imprisonment. The person convicted, if placed under house arrest, shall be monitored by an electronic monitoring device, which verifies the offender's location. The offender shall serve a minimum of one hundred twenty hours of confinement within the boundaries of the offender's residence. Any exceptions to remaining within the boundaries of the offender's residence provided for in the house arrest agreement shall not be counted as part of the one hundred twenty hours; and 
2.  In addition, prior to sentencing for any conviction pursuant to Section 10.04.0298.1.i. or B.1.ii., the court shall order the person to participate in an alcohol and drug evaluation conducted by a provider in accordance with K.S.A. 8-1008, and amendments thereto. The person shall be required to follow any recommendation made by the provider after such evaluation, unless otherwise ordered by the court. 
C.  Any person eighteen years of age or older convicted of a violation of this section who had one or more children under the age of eighteen years in the vehicle at the time of the offense shall have such person's punishment enhanced by one month of imprisonment. This imprisonment shall be served consecutively to any other minimum mandatory penalty imposed for a violation of this section. Any enhanced penalty imposed shall not exceed the maximum sentence allowable by law. During the service of the enhanced penalty, the judge may order the person on house arrest, work release or other conditional release. 
D.  If a person is charged with a violation of 10.04.029A.4. or A.5., as incorporated in this section, the fact that the person is or has been entitled to use the drug under the laws of this state shall not constitute a defense against the charge. 
E.  The court may establish the terms and time for payment of any fines, fees, assessments and costs imposed pursuant to this section. Any assessment and costs shall be required to be paid not later than ninety days after imposed, and any remainder of the fine shall be paid prior to the final release of the defendant by the court. 
F.  In lieu of payment of a fine imposed pursuant to this section, the court may order that the person perform community service specified by the court. The person shall receive a credit on the fine imposed in an amount equal to five dollars for each full hour spent by the person in the specified community service. The community service ordered by the court shall be required to be performed not later than one year after the fine is imposed or by an earlier date specified by the court. If by the required date the person performs an insufficient amount of community service to reduce to zero the portion of the fine required to be paid by the person, the remaining balance of the fine shall become due on that date. 
G.  The court shall electronically report every conviction of a violation of this section to the division. Prior to sentencing under the provisions of this section, the court shall request and shall receive from the: 
1.  Division, a record of all prior convictions obtained against such person for any violation of any of the motor vehicle laws of this state; and 
2.  Kansas bureau of investigation central repository, all criminal history record information concerning such person. 
H.  Upon conviction of a person of a violation of this section, the division, upon receiving a report of conviction, shall: (1) disqualify the person from driving a commercial motor vehicle under K.S.A. 8-2,142, and amendments thereto; and (2) suspend, restrict or suspend and restrict the person's driving privileges as provided by K.S.A. 8-1014, and amendments thereto. 
I.  The court is authorized to order that the convicted person pay restitution to any victim who suffered loss due to the violation for which the person was convicted. 
J.  Upon the filing of a complaint, citation or notice to appear alleging a violation of this section, and prior to conviction thereof, a city attorney shall request and shall receive from the: (a) division of vehicles a record of all prior convictions obtained against such person for any violations of any of the motor vehicle laws of this state; and (b) Kansas bureau of investigation central repository all criminal history record information concerning such person. 
K.  No plea bargaining agreement shall be entered into nor shall any judge approve a plea bargaining agreement entered into for the purpose of permitting a person charged with a violation of this section which prohibits the acts prohibited by this section, to avoid the mandatory penalties established by this section. 
L.  The alternatives set out in subsection A. may be pleaded in the alternative, and the city may, but shall not be required to, elect one or more of such alternatives prior to submission of the case to the fact finder. 
M.  For the purpose of determining whether a conviction is a first, second, third or subsequent conviction in sentencing under this section: 
1.  Convictions for a violation of K.S.A. 8-1567, and amendments thereto, or a violation of an ordinance of any city or resolution of any county that prohibits the acts that such section prohibits, or entering into a diversion agreement in lieu of further criminal proceedings on a complaint alleging any such violations, shall be taken into account, but only convictions or diversions occurring on or after July 1, 2001. Nothing in this provision shall be construed as preventing any court from considering any convictions or diversions occurring during the person's lifetime in determining the sentence to be imposed within the limits provided for a first, second, third, fourth or subsequent offense; 
2.  Any convictions for a violation of the following sections occurring during a person's lifetime shall be taken into account:

v.  Aggravated vehicular homicide, K.S.A. 21-3405a, prior to its repeal, or vehicular battery, K.S.A. 21-3405b, prior to its repeal, if the crime was committed while committing a violation of K.S.A. 8-1567, and amendments thereto; 
3.  Conviction includes: 
i.  Entering into a diversion agreement in lieu of further criminal proceedings on a complaint alleging a violation of a crime described in subsection M.2.; and 
ii.  Conviction of a violation of an ordinance of a city in this state, a resolution of a county in this state or any law of another jurisdiction that would constitute an offense that is comparable to the offense described in subsection M.1. or M.2. 
4.  It is irrelevant whether an offense occurred before or after conviction for a previous offense; and 
5.  Multiple convictions of any crime described in subsection M.1. or M.2. arising from the same arrest shall only be counted as one conviction. 
N.  For the purposes of determining whether an offense is comparable, the following shall be considered: 
1.  The name of the out-of-jurisdiction offense; 
2.  The elements of the out-of-jurisdiction offense; and 
3.  Whether the out-of-jurisdiction offense prohibits similar conduct to the conduct prohibited by the closest approximate Kansas offense. 
O.  For the purpose of this section: 
1.  Alcohol concentration means the number of grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters of blood or per two hundred ten liters of breath;

A.  Any person who operates or attempts to operate a vehicle within this state is deemed to have given consent to submit to a preliminary screening test of the person's breath or saliva, or both, subject to the provisions set out in subsection B. 
B.  A law enforcement officer may request a person who is operating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle within this state to submit to a preliminary screening test of the person's breath or saliva, or both, if the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the person has been operating or attempting to operate a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs or both alcohol and drugs. 
C.  At the time the test is requested, the person shall be given oral notice that: 
1.  There is no right to consult with an attorney regarding whether to submit to testing; 
2.  Refusal to submit to testing is a traffic infraction; and 
3.  Further testing may be required after the preliminary screening test. 
Failure to provide the notice shall not be an issue or defense in any action. The law enforcement officer then shall request the person to submit to the test. 
D.  Refusal to take and complete the test as requested is a traffic infraction. If the person submits to the test, the results shall be used for the purpose of assisting law enforcement officers in determining whether an arrest should be made and whether to request the tests authorized by K.S.A. 8-1001 and amendments thereto. A law enforcement officer may arrest a person based in whole or in part upon the results of a preliminary screening test. Such results shall not be admissible in any civil or criminal action concerning the operation of or attempted operation of a vehicle except to aid the court or hearing officer in determining a challenge to the validity of the arrest or the validity of the request to submit to a test pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1001 and amendments thereto. Following the preliminary screening test, additional tests may be requested pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1001 and amendments thereto. 
E.  Any preliminary screening of a person's breath shall be conducted with a device approved pursuant to K.S.A. 65-1,107, and amendments thereto.

10.04.029.6 - Commercial driver's licenses; diversion agreements not allowed. 
A.  A driver or a holder of a commercial driver's license may not enter into a diversion agreement in lieu of further criminal proceedings that would prevent such person's conviction for any violation, in any type of motor vehicle, of a state or local traffic control law, except a parking violation, from appearing on the person's record, whether the person was convicted for an offense committed in the state where the person is licensed or another state. 
B.  For purposes of subsection A., a person shall be considered a holder of a commercial driver's license if the person was a holder of a commercial driver's license at the time the person was arrested or was issued a citation and shall remain a holder of a commercial driver's license even if the person surrenders the commercial driver's license after the arrest or citation.

B.  The signal given by the police officer may be by hand, voice, emergency light, or siren: 
1.  If the officer giving such signal is within or upon an official police vehicle or police bicycle at the time the signal is given, the vehicle or bicycle shall be appropriately marked showing it to be an official police vehicle or police bicycle; or

D.  1.  For the purpose of this section conviction means a final conviction without regard whether sentence was suspended or probation granted after such conviction. Forfeiture of bail, bond or collateral deposited to secure a defendant's appearance in court, which forfeiture has not been vacated, shall be equivalent to a conviction. For the purpose of determining whether a conviction is a first, second, third or subsequent conviction in sentencing under this section it is irrelevant whether an offense occurred before or after conviction for a previous offense. 
2.

C.  Sidewalks on a vacant lot adjoining or located between two occupied lots shall be constructed no later than three years following the date listed on the final certificate of occupancy issued on any occupied lot adjoining said vacant lot unless the city engineer determines that construction of such sidewalk should be deferred to combine construction of the same with other similar construction work in the immediate area, in which case the responsible party shall furnish such guaranties as the city engineer may require to assure construction of the required sidewalk.

Should it be found that soil or pollutants have already or may be carried into the MS4 or waters of the United States, immediate measures will be taken by the owner to remedy the violation and/or remove the pollutants. If the owner fails to remove pollutants within the time period prescribed in the notice of violation from the city, the city may remove the pollutants and assess the cost thereof to the responsible owner. Failure of the owner to pay such costs will be grounds for the denial of further approvals or the withholding of occupancy certificates. 
4.  When determined to be necessary for the effective implementation of this section, the superintendent may require any plans and specifications that are prepared for the construction of site improvements to illustrate and describe the best management practices required by subsection (A)(1) of this section that will be implemented at the construction site. Should the proper BMP's not be installed or if the BMP's are ineffective, upon reasonable notice to the owner, the city may deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, subdivision plat, site development plan, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy. 
5.  The owner of a site of construction activity is responsible for compliance with the requirements in this subsection. In the case of new subdivisions, builders on individual lots can operate under the developer's NPDES permit if the developer's SWP3 deals with individual lots and the contractor's certification has been signed. 
6.  Any contractor on a construction site will also be required to use best management practices so as to minimize pollutants that enter into the MS4. 
7.  All persons shall avoid damaging BMP devices once in place. Any person damaging a BMP device shall be responsible for the repair of the damaged BMP device. Malicious destruction of a BMP device or failure of such responsible person to repair BMP device will be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
B.  Sites Requiring Federal and/or State NPDES Stormwater Discharge Permits. All owners of and contractors on sites of construction activity, that require a federal or state NPDES stormwater discharge permit, or that are part of a common plan of development or sale requiring such permit(s), shall comply with the following requirements (in addition to those in subsection A of this section): 
1.  Any owner who intends to obtain coverage for stormwater discharges from a construction site under the Kansas general permit for stormwater discharges from construction sites ("the construction general permit") shall submit a signed copy of its notice of intent (NOI) to the superintendent when a building permit application is made. If the construction activity is already underway upon the effective date of this chapter, the NOI shall be submitted within thirty days. When ownership of the construction site changes, a revised NOI shall be submitted within fifteen days of the change in ownership. 
2.  A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWP3) shall be prepared and implemented in accordance with the requirements of the construction general permit or any individual or group NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the construction site, and with any additional requirement imposed by or under this chapter and any other city chapter. 
3.  The SWP3 shall be prepared by a qualified person and shall comply with State NPDES requirements. The signature of the preparer shall constitute his or her attestation that the SWP3 fully complies with the requirements of the permit issued. 
4.  The SWP3 shall be completed prior to the submittal of the NOI to the superintendent and for new construction, prior to the commencement of construction activities. The SWP3 shall be updated and modified as appropriate and as required by the NPDES permit. 
5.  The superintendent may require any owner who is required by subsection (B)(2) of this section to prepare a SWP3, to submit the SWP3, and any modifications thereto, to the superintendent for review at any time. 
6.  Upon the superintendent's review of the SWP3 and any site inspection that he or she may conduct, if the SWP3 is not being fully implemented, the superintendent or his or her representative may upon reasonable notice to the owner, deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, site development plan, final occupancy certificate, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction. A stop work order may also be issued. 
7.  All contractors working on a site subject to a NPDES permit shall sign a copy of the following certification statement before beginning work on the site: "I certify under penalty of law that I understand the terms and conditions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit that authorizes the stormwater discharges associated with construction activity from the construction site identified as part of this certification and with the stormwater pollution prevention ordinance of the city, and I agree to implement and follow the provisions of the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3) for the construction site." The certification must include the name and title of the person providing the signature; the name, address, and telephone number of the contracting firm; the address (or other identifying description) of the site; and the date the certification is made. All contractors will be responsible for their own activities to ensure that they comply with the owners' SWP3. Failure to comply with the SWP3 or malicious destruction of BMP devices is deemed to be a violation of this chapter. 
8.  The SWP3 and the certifications of contractors required by subsection (B)(7) of this section, and with any modifications attached, shall be retained at the construction site from the date of construction commencement through the date of final stabilization. 
9.  The superintendent may notify the owner at any time that the SWP3 does not meet the requirements of the NPDES permit issued or any additional requirement imposed by or under this chapter. Such notification shall identify those provisions of the permit or this chapter which are not being met by the SWP3, and identify which provisions of the SWP3 require modification in order to meet such requirements. Within thirty days of such notification from the superintendent, the owner shall make the required changes to the SWP3 and shall submit to the superintendent a written certification from the owner that the requested changes have been made. 
10.  The owner shall amend the SWP3 whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation or maintenance, which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or to the waters of the United States, and which has not otherwise been addressed in the SWP3, or if the SWP3 proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in otherwise achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges. 
11.  Qualified personnel (provided by the owner of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every seven calendar days and within twenty-four hours of the end of the storm that is one-half inch or greater. Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system. Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. Where discharge locations or points are accessible, they shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters or the MS4. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking. 
12.  Based on the results of the inspections required by subsection (B)(11) of this section, the pollution prevention measures identified in the SWP3 shall be revised as appropriate. Such modifications shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the SWP3 within ten calendar days following the inspection. 
13.  A report summarizing the scope of any inspection required by subsection (B)(11) of this section, and the names(s) and qualifications of personnel making the inspection, the date(s) of the inspection, major observations relating to the implementation of the SWP3, and actions taken in accordance with subsection (B)(12) of this section shall be made and retained on site as part of the SWP3. Such report shall identify any incidence of noncompliance. Where a report does not identify any incidence of noncompliance, the report shall contain a certification that the facility is in compliance with the SWP3, the facility's NPDES permit, and this chapter. The report shall be certified and signed by the person responsible for making it. 
14.  The owner shall retain copies of any SWP3 and all reports required by this chapter or by the NPDES permit for the site, and records of all data used to complete the NOI for a period of at least three years from the date that the site is finally stabilized. 
15.  Upon final stabilization of the construction site, the owner shall submit written certification to the superintendent that the site has been finally stabilized. The city may withhold the final occupancy or use permit for any premises constructed on the site until such certification of final stabilization has been filed and the superintendent has determined, following any appropriate inspection, that final stabilization has occurred and that any required permanent structural controls have been completed.

A.  A monthly stormwater fee is hereby imposed on each and every developed residential property and developed nonresidential property within the city, other than property not serviced. 
B.  Calculation of stormwater fee. 
1.  For each developed residential property, the stormwater fee shall be equal to three dollars multiplied by the number of individual dwelling units on the property. When a new dwelling unit is constructed, imposition of the stormwater fee attributable to such dwelling unit shall commence upon issuance of the certificate of occupancy therefor; provided, that if construction is at least fifty percent complete and is halted for a period of three months, then such dwelling unit shall be deemed complete and imposition of the stormwater fee shall commence at the end of such three-month period. 
2.  For each developed nonresidential property, the stormwater fee shall be the sum of: 
(a)  Two dollars multiplied by the number of ERUs of impermeable surface thereon; and 
(b)  One dollar and fifty cents multiplied by the number of ERUs of permeable surface thereon; 
As determined by the finance director from time to time based on any information and data deemed pertinent by the finance director. 
3.  For each developed nonresidential property, the number of ERUs shall be calculated by dividing the total square feet of impermeable area and permeable area, respectively, by two thousand two hundred thirty-three; provided, that: 
(a)  A minimum of one ERU shall be assigned to each such property; 
(b)  When undeveloped property becomes developed nonresidential property or additional development occurs on developed nonresidential property, imposition of the stormwater fee attributable thereto shall commence or increase, as the case may be, upon issuance of the certificate of occupancy therefor; and provided further, that if such development or development is halted before a certificate of occupancy has been issued therefor, imposition of the stormwater fee shall commence on the date the building official reasonably determines that such development or redevelopment is substantially complete or three months after such development or redevelopment halted, whichever is earlier; 
(c)  For developed nonresidential property with multiple occupants that have separately metered water service and make joint use of common impermeable or permeable areas, the city finance director shall allocate the stormwater fee pro rata among such occupants. Any owner or occupant aggrieved by the finance director's allocation decision may appeal such decision to the city manager as provided in this chapter. 
C.  For the purposes of computing and allocating stormwater fees established hereby, the finance director shall initially and from time to time thereafter determine the number of dwelling units located on developed residential property and calculate the number of ERUs for developed nonresidential real property in the city. Such initial and subsequent determinations may be based on any information and data that the finance director deems pertinent. 
D.  The city manager may establish and implement incentives to reduce stormwater fees that would otherwise be imposed on developed nonresidential properties pursuant to this chapter. Such incentives may include but need not be limited to, credits against the applicable stormwater fee for properties that utilize privately owned and maintained retention or detention facilities, when utilization thereof results in a reduction of the operating costs of the stormwater utility. Any such incentives shall be subject to review and modification by the city council.

13.30.080 - Collection of stormwater fee. 
A.  1.  Payment of stormwater fees shall initially be the responsibility of the customer who is paying for water or sewer service for the property; provided, that for properties not served by city water or sewer utilities, stormwater fees shall be the responsibility of the person in possession of the property unless other arrangements have been made. If no person is in possession of the property, then the stormwater fees shall be the responsibility of the property owner. The property owner is responsible for all stormwater fees not paid by a city utility customer or other person in possession. 
2.  The stormwater fee shall be billed and collected: 
(a)  Monthly, along with charges for water and sewer service, for those properties served by another city utility; and 
(b)  Semi-annually for all other properties.

In the event a partial payment is received, such payment shall be applied first to the water or sewer portion of the account and then to the stormwater fee portion of the account. 
4.  Unless otherwise provided herein, stormwater fees shall become due and payable in accordance with the city code, rules and regulations applicable to city water and sewer utilities, and the El Paso Water Co., Inc. Operations Manual. 
B.  Penalties for late payment of stormwater fees shall be the same as that imposed for late payment of water and sewer utility charges. In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by this chapter or another ordinance of the city, failure of any user of the stormwater management system to pay such fee promptly when due shall subject such user to discontinuance of water services. 
C.  In addition to other available remedies, stormwater fees imposed pursuant to this chapter, when delinquent, may be certified by the clerk of the city to the county clerk of Sedgwick County to be placed on the ad valorem tax roll for collection, subject to the same penalties and to be collected in like manner as taxes, and such fees shall thereafter constitute a lien upon the real estate upon which such charges were imposed, regardless of whether such fees accrued when the property was in possession of the owner or a nonowner. 
(Ord. No. 2117, § 8, 7-10-12) 
13.30.090 - Appeal procedure.

Chapter 17.08 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT 

17.08.010 - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in [Section] 17.08.030(B)1.; to establish or maintain the city's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this chapter to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
3.  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard. 
(Ord. No. 2302, § 2, 11-22-16) 
17.08.020 - Title. 
    This title shall be known as the "Floodplain Management Code of the City." It is supplemental to other ordinances of the city which manage stormwaters. 
(Ord. No. 2302, § 3, 11-22-16) 
17.08.030 - Statutory authorization and findings of fact. 
(A)  Statutory Authorization. 
1.  Approval of Draft Ordinance by Kansas Chief Engineer Prior to Adoption. The following floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved in draft form by the chief engineer of the division of water resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture on October 19, 2016. 
2.  Kansas Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the state of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et seq., and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. 
(B)  Findings of Fact. 
1.  Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of Derby, Kansas, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  General Causes of the Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
3.  Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
a.  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods, which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter. The base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated December 22, 2016 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
b.  Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
c.  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
d.  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
e.  Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 2302, § 4, 11-22-16)

The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer. 
(D)  Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones). Located within special flood hazard areas as described in [Section] 17.08.050(A) are areas designated as AO zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. The following provisions apply: 
1.  AO Zones. 
A.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the city's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
B.  All new construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the city FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified) or together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to that level so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
C.  Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

(E)  Floodway. Located within special flood hazard areas established in 17.08.050(A), are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply to the floodway area: 
1.  The city shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. 
2.  The city shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and certified by a professional registered engineer that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels within the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
3.  If [Section] 17.08.070(E)2., is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of [Section] 17.08.070. 
4.  In unnumbered A zones, the city shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources as set forth in [Section] 17.08.070(A)2. 
(F)  Recreational Vehicles. 
1.  Recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and numbered A zones, AE, AH, and AO zones on the city's FIRM shall comply with the following: 
A.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; and 
B.  Be fully licensed; and 
C.  Be ready for highway use, meaning the recreational vehicle is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
D.  Meet the permitting, elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2302, § 8, 11-22-16) 
17.08.080 - Floodplain management variance procedures. 
(A)  Establishment of Appeal Board. The board of zoning appeals, as established by the city of Derby shall have the power to hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management requirements of this chapter. 
(B)  Responsibility of Appeal Board. Where an application for a floodplain development permit is denied by the floodplain administrator, the applicant may apply for such floodplain development permit directly to the appeal board, as defined in [Section] 17.08.080(A). 
The appeal board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(C)  Application, Notice and Hearing. Any person desiring to apply for an appeal or a variance shall complete an application on a form provided by the floodplain administrator and shall submit such application along with any other information that may be required. The application and any supporting materials shall be forwarded to the appeal board for review in accordance with the public hearing procedures established by K.S.A. 12-759, et seq., and restated in the city's zoning regulations. In addition to the review procedures established in K.S.A. 12-759, et seq., and those contained in the city's zoning regulations, the appeal board shall also consider the variance criteria identified in [Section] 17.08.080(E) and variance conditions identified in [Section] 17.08.080(F) when considering variances for development in a floodplain. 
(D)  Further Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the district court as provided in K.S.A. 12-759 and 12-760. 
(E)  Floodplain Management Variance Criteria. In passing upon such applications for variances, the appeal board shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following criteria: 
1.  Danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
2.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the city; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, streets and bridges. 
(F)  Conditions for Approving Floodplain Management Variances. 
1.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, providing items numbered 2.-6. below have been folly considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, repair, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination, provide the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
5.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; 
c.  Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter. 
7.  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. 
8.  A variance granted by the appeal board or the city for regulations in this chapter does not apply to flood insurance requirements which remain in place for any varied use or structure and cannot be varied by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2302, § 9, 11-22-16) 
17.08.090 - Penalties for violation. 
(A)  Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with granting of variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than five hundred dollars, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues, shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city of Derby or other appropriate authority from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(B)  The city shall have the authority to maintain civil suits or actions in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter and to abate nuisances maintained in violation thereof. In the event that any building or structure is or is proposed to be erected, constructed, altered, converted or maintained in violation of this chapter, or any building, structure, or land is proposed to be used in violation of this chapter, the city may, in addition to any other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful, erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use, or to correct or abate such violation, or to prevent the occupancy of such building, structure or land. 
(Ord. No. 2302, § 10, 11-22-16) 
17.08.100 - Amendments. 
    The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries set forth in this chapter may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or appealed to reflect any and all changes in the National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, provided, however, that no such action may be taken until after a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties of interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city of Derby. At least twenty days shall elapse between the date of this publication and the public hearing. A copy of such amendments will be provided to the FEMA Region VII office. The regulations of this chapter are in compliance with the NFIP regulations.

A. Minimum Requirements. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these
regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
health, safety, morals, comfort and general welfare.
B. Overlapping or Contradictory Regulations. Where the conditions imposed by the
provision of these regulations upon the use of land or structures are either more

the adoption of these regulations shall become or be made lawful solely by reason of the
adoption of these regulations; and to the extent that, and in any respect that, said
unlawful use or structure is in conflict with the requirements of these regulations, said
use or structure remains unlawful hereunder.

to be a consent, license or permit to use any property, to locate, construct or maintain
any structure or facility or to carry on any trade, industry, occupation or activity.
F. Effect on Existing Permits. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to require
any change in plans, construction or designated use of any land or structure in the event

ACCESSORY APARTMENT: A dwelling unit which is subordinate to and serves a principal
single-family dwelling unit. An accessory apartment may be wholly within, or may be
detached from, a principal single-family dwelling unit, but in any case, shall not exceed 50%
of the area of the principal residential structure. (See Section 600 for Accessory Uses and
Section 403A.G.4 for Use Limitations.)
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE OR USE: As defined in Article 6.
ACTIVE REPAIR: A term developed to differentiate between inoperable vehicles that are in
the process of being made operable and those that are being stored without the benefit of
ongoing repair or which are being stored for salvage purposes. For purposes of these
regulations, the term active repair means vehicles or equipment that are currently
undergoing necessary repairs to make them operable within thirty (30) days from the date of
the violation notice.
ADULT CARE CENTER: A facility in which care and activities are provided on an hourly or
daily basis for adults of all ages. The latter arrangement is not construed to be a "nursing

established and administered by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment unless
warranted by the particular services provided.
ADULT CARE HOME: A residential facility operated as a home occupation for not more
than four adults wherein care and activities are provided on an hourly or daily basis or
limited nursing care is provided on a 24-hour basis which may or may not be regulated
and/or licensed by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
AGRICULTURE: The use of land for growing crops in the open, horticulture, nurseries,
truck farms and accessory uses including structures not in a designated flood plain for

ZONING REGULATIONS Article 2  INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS
2 - 8
AICUZ STUDY: A document prepared by the United States Air Force entitled, Air
Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study which identifies the location of runway
clear zones, aircraft accident potential zones and noise contours for McConnell Air Force
Base. The document recommends compatible land uses for areas in the vicinity of the
Base. The purpose of the document is to help achieve compatible uses of public and
private lands on land near to or impacted by Base operations through providing
recommendations to local governments for controlling incompatible development and

as described in Article 4 of these regulations and includes residential, non-residential
and special purpose districts.
B. Zoning Maps.
1. The boundaries of the districts described in Article 4 are as indicated on the
Official Zoning Map(s) which is on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator
and identified on its face as part of these regulations. Each of the zoning map(s),
with all notations, references and other matters shown thereon, is as much a part
of these regulations as if specifically set forth herein. (See Section 900.A.9 for
zoning map(s) certificate and revisions).
2. These regulations are intended to provide that the entire area of the zoning
jurisdiction, including all the land and water areas, rivers, creeks, streets, alleys
and railroads and other rights-of-way, be included in the districts established
herein. Any area not shown on the zoning map(s) as being included in any
district shall be deemed to be in the most restrictive district pursuant to these
regulations.
C. Boundaries. In the event that uncertainties exist with respect to the intended
boundaries of the various districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map(s), the following
rules shall apply:
1. Where boundary lines are indicated as approximately following streets, alleys,
easements, railroads, rivers, streams or bodies of water, such boundaries shall
be construed as following the centerlines thereof or otherwise be construed to
coincide with lot or tract lines, unless otherwise indicated.
2. Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of boundaries as
stated in Section 301.C.1 above, the district boundaries shall be determined by
the use of the scale shown on the zoning map, unless an exact distance is
shown.
3. When a lot held in one ownership on the effective date of these regulations is
divided by a district boundary line, the entire lot shall be construed to be within
the less restrictive district unless the application of this rule would increase the
area of the less restrictive portion of the lot by more than 25%.
D. Zoning of Rights-of-Way. All streets, alleys, public ways, waterways and railroad rightof-
way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone
as the property immediately abutting them. Where the center line of a street, alley,
public way, waterway or railroad right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of
such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same
as that of the abutting property up to such center line.

move must take place within six months from the date that the previous
manufactured/mobile home was moved off the lot, otherwise such use shall not
thereafter be reestablished. If within six (6) months, said use is reestablished, the
manufactured/mobile homes shall comply with all applicable building codes
within 60 days. In reestablishing such a home use, any existing nonconforming
lot size requirements or bulk regulations shall not be increased in nonconformity.
3. No manufactured/mobile home, or portion thereof, shall be moved onto any lot or
parcel for storage purposes in any district and no such home shall be temporarily
located in any district not otherwise permitting such homes. These provisions do
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS

304 SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING
Unless an exception is provided by this section, or a modification is made by the Planning
Commission pursuant to subsections 304.I.1.e or 304.P of these regulations, all multiple-family
and non-residential uses established shall provide screening, landscaping and limitations on
exterior lighting which meet the standards of this section.
A. Statement of Intent.
The provisions of this section are intended to aid in the following:
1. To foster through the use of landscaping materials and techniques aesthetically
pleasing developments which protect and preserve the appearance, character,
health, safety and welfare of the Community;
2. To increase the compatibility of adjacent land uses by requiring landscaped
buffer areas and/or screening between specified uses which minimize the
harmful impacts of noise, dust, debris, motor vehicle headlight glare or other
artificial light intrusions, and other objectionable activities or impacts created by
an adjoining or nearby land use;
3. To provide greenery to visually soften the appearance of vehicular parking and
use areas and to require screening of such areas from street rights-of-way;
4. To optimize environmental conditions within the community by providing shade,
air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, retardation of
stormwater and soil erosion, abatement of noise, glare and heat;
5. To set forth minimum standards that specify the amounts and types of landscape
materials to be planted within required landscape buffer areas;
6. To establish a listing of preferred trees, shrubs and groundcovers to be used to
meet landscaping requirements;
7. To provide for screening and/or landscaping between certain types of land uses
in order to enhance land use compatibility,
8. To set forth types of materials that may be used for fences and walls that may be
installed to satisfy screening requirements;
9. To screen certain unsightly equipment and materials from view of persons on
public streets or adjoining properties and to avoid light intrusion.
The above-outlined intent of this section is based on a finding by the Governing Body
that, if properly established and maintained, landscaping, screening and standards for
exterior lighting will improve the livability of neighborhoods, enhance the appearance of
non-residential areas, increase property values, improve relationships between
uncomplimentary uses, block undesirable views, soften and enhance the appearance of
vehicular parking and use areas, and contribute to a positive overall image of the
community.
In order to achieve the above-identified benefits, requirements for a LANDSCAPED
STREET YARD are established in subsections 304(G) and 304(H), requirements for
SCREENING AND EXTERIOR LIGHTING are set forth by subsection 304(I),
requirements for LANDSCAPING BUFFERS ALONG SIDE AND REAR LOT LINES are
established by subsection 304(J) and requirements for the SCREENING AND
LANDSCAPING OF VEHICULAR PARKING LOTS are set forth by subsection 304(K).

3-43
potential impacts associated with adjacent non-residential development. Screening shall
be provided on all properties developed for multiple-family residential purposes, offices
or institutional, business or industrial uses when such uses are established on property
adjacent to either single or two-family residential zoning districts and on all nonresidential
developments when such uses are established on property adjacent to
multiple-family residential zoning districts or as specified below.
1. Screening Standards.
Screening may be provided through the use of walls, fencing, evergreen
vegetation or landscaped earth berms, or a combination thereof. Walls and
fences constructed to meet the screening requirements of this subsection shall
be six feet in height, except that within 20 feet of a street right-of-way line the
height of the wall or fence shall be reduced to three feet. Screening shall be
provided in accordance with the following standards:
a. SCREENING ALONG SIDE OR REAR LOT LINES. Screening shall be
provided along all side or rear lot lines of non-residential uses when
adjacent to any residential zoning district and along all side or rear lot

one building) when adjacent to any single or two-family zoning district.
Screening may be omitted, for property zoned as either I-1 or B-1
zoning district, along any side or rear lot line or portion thereof, only when
the development of permitted uses within such zoning districts provides at
least a 25-foot wide landscaped yard adjacent to such lot line or portion
thereof. Such landscaped yards shall not be used for driveways,
vehicular parking, loading areas, recreational areas, signs or similar uses,
but shall be counted as the buffer area required by subsection 304.J.2 of
these regulations. If a minimum 25-foot wide landscaped yard is
proposed, the installation of plant materials shall be per a landscape plan
approved in accordance with subsection 304.E of this Ordinance.

or fences erected to satisfy the screening requirements of this subsection
shall be constructed of brick, stone, masonry, architectural tile, concrete
or wood or a combination of those materials, but may not include the use
of woven wire, welded wire or metal panels. Walls or fences erected to
satisfy the screening requirements of this subsection shall be per a plan
approved in accordance with subsection 304(E) of these regulations.
f. EVERGREEN VEGETATION AND LANDSCAPED EARTH BERMS
USED FOR SCREENING. Evergreen vegetation and landscaped earth
berms installed to satisfy the screening requirements of this subsection
shall be per a plan approved in accordance with subsection 304(E) of
these regulations.
g. DEFERRAL OF SCREENING REQUIREMENTS. If screening exists
adjacent to developing property which meets or exceeds the standards of
this subsection the Planning Commission, at the time of Site Plan Review,
or the Zoning Administrator, at the time of building plan review for projects
not requiring Planning Commission Site Plan Review, may determine that
additional screening is not necessary. However, if at any time the
existing screening on adjacent property fails to meet the requirements of
this subsection, as determined by the Planning Commission or Zoning
Administrator, screening shall be installed as per the requirements of this
subsection.
2. Requirements for Screening and Landscaping of Vehicular Parking Lots.
In addition to the requirements of this subsection, vehicular parking lots shall be
provided screening and/or landscaping pursuant to the requirements of
subsection 304(K) of these regulations.
3. Requirements for Screening Established by District Regulations.
In addition to the requirements of this subsection, the screening and/or
landscaping requirements, if any, required as part of the USE LIMITATIONS
subsection of the specific district regulations shall be met. Screening or
landscaping installed to meet the USE LIMITATIONS of a specific zoning district
shall be per a plan approved in accordance with subsection 304(E) of these
regulations.
4. Lighting Standards.
Outdoor lighting sources shall be arranged, located, screened or shielded to
direct light away from adjoining properties or any street right-of-way. The

intended to provide visual enhancement between single/two family residential
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-45
developments and multiple-family residential projects by requiring a minimum number of
trees to be planted along the side and rear lot lines common to those uses. In addition,
except for the B-4 CENTRAL SHOPPING DISTRICT, and the B-2A BUCKNER
BUSINESS DISTRICT, the provisions of this subsection are intended to provide visual
enhancement along the side or rear lot lines common to any residential zoning district
and any non-residential development. Landscaping installed to satisfy the requirements
of this subsection shall be per a plan approved in accordance with subsection 304(E) of
these regulations. Landscaped buffers along side and rear lot lines shall be provided in
accordance with the following standards:
1. Landscape Buffers Between Multiple-Family Residential Projects (a project
with three or more dwelling units in one building) and Single/Two-Family
Residential Zoning Districts.
a. DEPTH OF LANDSCAPED BUFFER. The required buffer shall be a
minimum of 15 feet in width and shall be continuous in nature.
b. MINIMUM AMOUNT OF LANDSCAPE MATERIALS TO BE
INSTALLED WITHIN LANDSCAPE BUFFER. There shall be a

screening may be located within the continuous landscape buffer area.
Vehicular parking, loading areas and trash receptacles shall not be
located within the buffer area.
2. Landscape Buffers Between Non-Residential Projects and any Residential
Zoning District.
a. DESIGN STANDARDS. There shall be a minimum of one shade tree
or two ornamental trees for each 40 feet, or faction thereof, along the lot
line abutting any residential district. The trees may be irregularly
spaced but shall be within 15 feet of the property line common to the
residential district. If utility and/or drainage easements occupy the 15-
foot wide perimeter area, the trees may be located outside any such
easements. Each tree shall be in a planting area having a minimum
permeable ground surface of at least 49 square feet. The minimum
size of required trees, at the time of planting, shall be as follows:

ZONING REGULATIONS Article 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-46
b. EFFECT ON SCREENING REQUIREMENTS AND USE OF AREA
FOR VEHICULAR PARKING. Landscaping installed to meet the
requirements of this subsection is in addition to the screening required
by subsection 304(I). Required screening and vehicular parking may be
located within 15 feet of a property line that abuts a residential zoning
district provided such uses do not interfere with trees required by these
regulations. If vehicular parking is to be provided within 15 feet of a
property line that abuts a residential zoning district, required trees shall
be protected from vehicular encroachment through the use of
appropriately located vertical curbs or wheel stops.
K. Parking Lot Screening and Landscaping.
Except for vehicular parking areas which serve single and two-family residential
uses, all vehicular parking areas shall be provided continuous street frontage
planting strips for the installation of screening features that are in accordance
with the standards set forth below. In addition, vehicular parking areas with 50 or
more parking spaces shall provide internal planting islands for the installation of
trees that meet the standards of this subsection. Screening and landscaping
installed to satisfy the requirements of this subsection shall be per a plan
approved in accordance with subsection 304(E) of these regulations.
1. Screening from Adjacent Street Rights-of-Way.
a. MINIMUM WIDTH OF PLANTING STRIP. When located along any
street right-of-way, vehicular parking lots shall be provided a minimum
5-foot wide continuous planting area for the purpose of providing space
for screening the parking area from the adjacent street right-of-way.
Such planting strip shall not be located within street right-of-way, except
as may be permitted by subsection 304(L)(10), but may be a part of the
landscaped street yard required by subsection 304(G). If earthen
berms are to be installed to achieve screening of the parking lot from
adjacent street right-of-way, a strip of land with at least 20 feet of depth
shall be provided for the berm and associated landscaping.
b. LOCATION AND PROTECTION OF PLANTING STRIP. The minimum
5-foot wide continuous planting area shall be located adjacent to the
edge of parking lot pavement and shall be protected from damage by
vehicles or from vehicular encroachment by appropriately located
vertical curbs or wheel stops.
c. USE OF WALLS OR FENCES TO ACHIEVE REQUIRED
SCREENING. If walls and fences are installed to achieve screening of
a parking lot from adjacent street right-of-way, the wall or fence shall be
three feet in height, must avoid a blank and monotonous appearance by
using such measures as architectural articulation and placement of
vines, shrubs and/or trees and must be compatible (i.e., similar in color,
texture and pattern) with the architectural character of the building(s)
being served by the parking lot. Walls or fences installed to achieve
parking lot screening from adjacent street right-of-way shall be
constructed of brick, stone, masonry, architectural tile or concrete or a
combination of those materials, but may not include the use of wood,
woven wire, welded wire or metal panels. Such walls or fences shall be
located adjacent to the parking lot and may be located within the 5-foot
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-47
wide continuous planting area, but shall not eliminate the requirement to
install landscape materials within remaining portions of the planting
area. Required landscape materials shall be located on the street rightof-
way side of the wall or fence.
d. USE OF SHRUBS TO ACHIEVE REQUIRED SCREENING. If shrubs
are installed to achieve screening of a parking lot from adjacent street
right-of-way, a sufficient number and type of shrubs shall be installed to
achieve solid continuous screening of the parking lots street frontage.
The minimum size of shrubs at the time of installation shall be 18 inches
in height. Shrubs used for parking lot screening shall be expected to
obtain a height of at least 36 inches within the third year after planting.
Spacing between shrubs will depend upon the type of shrub, but shall
be close enough to achieve a solid screen when the plants reach
maturity. The minimum size of other landscaping materials installed in
the 5-foot wide continuous planting area, at the time of planting, shall be
as follows: SHADE TREES --- 2-inch or greater caliper measured at a
height of six inches above the ground; ORNAMENTAL TREES --- 1 1/2-
inch or greater caliper measured at a height of six inches above the
ground; EVERGREEN TREES --- 5 feet or more in height.
e. TREES WITHIN PLANTING STRIP. Trees installed within the parking
lot planting strip may be counted toward meeting the number of trees
required to be installed by subsection 304.H of these regulations.
Shrubs used to achieve screening of the vehicular parking lot shall not
be counted as a substitute for required trees.
2. Landscaping Requirements for the Interior of Vehicular Parking Areas.
a. APPLICABILITY. In order to enhance the appearance of vehicle
parking lots and provide relief from the effect of large expanses of
paved areas, all new parking lots which provide 50 or more parking
spaces and all additions to existing parking lots which create an
additional 50 or more parking spaces shall provide interior planting
islands for installation of trees in accordance with this subsection.
b. MINIMUM NUMBER OF TREES TO BE PLANTED IN INTERIOR
ISLANDS. Shade or ornamental trees shall be planted and maintained
in planting islands that are in the interior of a vehicular parking lot in the
following proportion: at least one shade or two ornamental trees for
each 50 vehicular parking spaces. Vehicular stacking or holding
spaces shall not be counted when determining the number of parking
spaces in the parking lot. Trees required by this subsection are in
addition to trees required for the landscaped street yard [subsection
304(H)] and buffer areas [subsection 304(J)].
c. MINIMUM SIZE OF INTERIOR PLANTING ISLANDS. Interior planting
islands to accommodate the trees required by this section shall have a
minimum of at least 49 square feet of permeable ground surface per
tree. The trees within interior planting islands shall be protected from
possible damage caused from vehicles through the use of raised
vertical curbs, wheel stops or other protective means.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-48
d. MINIMUM SIZE OF TREES TO BE PLANTED IN INTERIOR
PLANTING ISLANDS. The minimum size of trees required to planted
in interior planting islands, at the time of planting, shall be a 2-inch
caliper for a shade tree and a 1 1/2-inch caliper for an ornamental tree,
both measured at a height of 6 inches above the ground. Trees
proposed for planting within interior planting islands shall be site
specific in character.
e. LOCATION OF INTERIOR PLANTING ISLANDS. The planting islands
required by this subsection shall be reasonably dispersed throughout
the vehicular parking lot, but shall not be at locations that unduly
obstruct visibility or interfere with on-site vehicular circulation.
L. Other Landscape or Screening Regulations.
1. Landscaping and screening shall not conflict with the vision triangle requirements
of these regulations.
2. The use of artificial trees, shrubs, vines, turf, or other plants to meet the
requirements of this section is prohibited.
3. Required landscaped street yards [304.G and 304.H], landscaped buffer areas
[304.J] and parking lot planting strips [304.K] shall provide a minimum of 55
percent ground surface covering with living grass or other living plant materials.
The foliage crown of trees that may extend over monolithic paved surfaces
beyond required landscaped yards / areas or required planting strips or over nonliving
surfaces within required landscaped yards / areas or planting strips shall
not be counted as a part of the 55 percent calculation. The remaining 45 percent
of required street yards, landscaped buffer areas and parking lot planting strips
may be covered with bark, wood chips, rock, bricks, stone or similar materials
(monolithic paving not included). An effective weed barrier shall be required in
non-living landscaped areas. If screening walls or fences are located within
required landscaped yards / areas or required parking lot planting strips, the
amount of ground surface area covered by such walls or fences shall not be
included as part of the figure used to compute the percentages of living / nonliving
coverage.
4. Clumped or multi-trunked trees, where used instead of single-trunk trees, shall
be credited as only one tree.
5. Landscaping shall not interfere with the general function, safety or accessibility of
any public utility easement. Landscaping shall be limited to an 8-inch mature
height when within three feet of a fire-hydrant, traffic signal or utility structure.
6. The existing indigenous vegetation on a site is encouraged to be retained in a
development project and may be counted toward required landscaping of this
section, provided the existing vegetation is adequately protected during
construction to ensure survival, meets the minimum size requirements of this
section, is healthy and insect free and is included in the list of preferred plant
materials, Appendix A of these regulations.
7. All existing vegetation located in the street right-of-way adjacent to a
development project shall be retained to the greatest extent possible, and may
be counted toward the required landscaping of this Section, provided the existing
vegetation complies with the requirements of subsection 304.L.6.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-49
8. Where a calculation of a requirement results in a fractional number, the
requirement shall be considered the next greatest whole number.
9. Prior to excavation for screening and landscaping within utility easements, the
location of all underground utilities shall be determined by calling the Kansas
One-Call System at 811.
10. Except for the B-4 CENTRAL SHOPPING DISTRICT, and the B-2A
BUCKNER BUSINESS DISTRICT, the placement of required landscaping within
street right-of-way is prohibited. For the B-4 Central Shopping District, and the
B-2A BUCKNER BUSINESS DISTRICT, required trees or shrubs may be
permitted to be placed in street or highway right-of-way if first approved in writing
by the Director of Public Works or designated agent and, if applicable, by the
Kansas Department of Transportation.
11. Walls and fences installed to meet the screening requirements of this section
shall be constructed within the perimeter of the subject zoning lot and shall not
be constructed within adjacent street rights-of-way.
12. Plants installed to meet the requirements of these regulations shall be highquality
nursery-grown stock which meets the American Association of
Nurserymen standards as specified by the American National Standards
Institution in ANSI Z60.1-1986 or as may be amended in the future. Landscape
plans shall avoid the over use of a single plant species.
13. In anticipation of future screening, landscaping and lighting requirements, these
issues are proper subjects to be discussed and, if deemed necessary by the
Planning Commission, applied at the public hearing required for a requested
zone change.
M. Maintenance.
1. The property owner is responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping
materials and shall keep them in a proper, neat and orderly appearance, free
from refuse and debris at all times.
2. Maintenance shall include mowing, trimming, weeding, cultivation, mulching,
tightening and repairing of guys and stakes, resetting plants to proper grades and
upright position, restoration of planting saucers, fertilizing, pruning, disease and
insect control and other necessary operations.
3. All landscaped areas shall be provided with a readily available permanent water
supply; provided, however, that LANDSCAPED BUFFER AREAS, required by
subsection 304(J), and LANDSCAPING WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF
VEHICULAR PARKING AREAS, required by subsection 304(K)(2), which utilize
drought-tolerant plants may use a temporary above-ground system. Irrigation
shall not be required for established trees and natural areas that remain
undisturbed by development activities. Irrigation systems shall be designed and
operated in a manner to avoid water on impervious surfaces and street rights-ofway
Long, narrow landscaped areas are difficult to irrigate efficiently, therefore
landscaped areas less than five feet in any dimension shall not be irrigated with
overhead spray sprinklers. Drip irrigation is acceptable for such areas.
4. Disturbed soil between trees and shrubs shall be mulched, planted or otherwise
treated to prevent wind and water erosion.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-50
5. Plants which die shall be replaced within 60 days or, if weather prohibits
replanting within that time, replanted within the first 30 days of the next available
planting season.
N. Water Conservation Measures.
When meeting the landscape requirements outlined in this section, property
owners are encouraged to use water in the most efficient way possible. A
number of principles for effective water usage are found in the Xeriscape
approach to landscaping. The term Xeriscape is derived from a Greek word
meaning dry. The desired effect of a Xeriscape, however, is to provide an
attractive and even lush-appearing landscape with a minimum amount of water
usage. This is accomplished through the application of the seven principles of
Xeriscape.
Regardless of the extent to which the principles of Xeriscape are applied,
AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION SYSTEMS installed in association with the
landscaping requirements of this Section, MUST BE EQUIPPED WITH
MOISTURE SENSING DEVICES OR AUTOMATIC RAIN SHUT-OFF DEVICES
that forestall scheduled watering cycles when moisture adequate to sustain
healthy plant life is present.
O. Enforcement / Assurances for Installation and Completion.
All work as indicated on an approved landscaping plan shall be inspected and approved
by the Zoning Administrator or their designated agent prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy for any project where landscaping is required.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a property owner may obtain a Certificate of Occupancy
for a building project prior to the completion of required landscaping work if the
completion is not possible, due to seasonal or weather conditions, and if the property
owner submits a fiscal assurance to the City which guarantees the completion of
required landscaping. Such fiscal assurance shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator and be in the form of an IRREVOCABLE LETTER OF CREDIT or
CERTIFIED CHECK for a dollar amount equal to ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE
PERCENT of the cost of the landscaping work and shall be accompanied by cost
estimates from a landscaping firm. If an IRREVOCABLE LETTER OF CREDIT is
chosen as the method of assuring completion of required landscaping, the STANDARD
LETTER OF CREDIT form of the City shall be used. Forfeiture of any IRREVOCABLE
LETTER OF CREDIT or CERTIFIED CHECK shall not relieve the owner of the
responsibility to complete required landscaping and / or screening.
P. Modifications.
The Planning Commission may, at its discretion, temporarily or permanently decrease,
increase or waive the landscaping requirements of this Section if the Commission finds
that: 1) adjacent or nearby land uses and properties and the general public will not
benefit from such requirements or 2) the Commission determines that the installation of
required landscaping is impractical or 3) the Commission determines that the amounts
of landscaping required by this section is insufficient to accomplish the intent of this
section.
Modifications to the landscaping requirements of this section shall be accomplished by
the Planning Commission at the time site plan review is completed pursuant to Section
305 of these regulations. For development projects not required to present site plan
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-51
review drawings to the Planning Commission, an applicant may volunteer to file a site
plan review request for Planning Commission review in order to propose, to the
Commission, modifications to the landscaping requirements of this section. Such
voluntary site plan review requests shall comply with all the requirements of Section 305,
including the payment of a filing fee.
Q. Adjustment of Approved Landscape Plans.
Recognizing that the market availability of species of plants identified on approved
landscape plans may not always be a constant and that exact plant locations may need
to be altered based on factors identified at the time of actual site development, the
Zoning Administrator is authorized to adjust approved landscape plans with regard to
plant species and the general location of plants. Such adjustment shall maintain the
integrity of the overall approved landscape plan and shall not be contrary to the design
requirements set forth in these regulations.
Should the Zoning Administrator determine that proposed changes represent a
substantial deviation from the approved plan, the Zoning Administrator shall not approve
the revised plan. Rather, the applicant may choose to file a revised site plan review
request for Planning Commission consideration. Any such request shall clearly
delineate the landscaping changes being requested. A decision by an applicant to refile
a site plan review request shall comply with all applicable requirements of Section 305,
including the payment of a filing fee.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-52
305 SITE PLAN APPROVAL
The purpose and intent of requiring site plan approval is to impose reasonable requirements to
achieve the following: the compatible arrangement of buildings, off-street parking, pedestrian
access, lighting, signage, landscaping, screening, outdoor display and storage, trash disposal,
ingress and egress and drainage on and from the site, in a manner that will promote safety and
convenience for the public and will preserve property values of surrounding properties.
A. Applicability.
All principal land uses shall submit site plans for approval by the Planning Commission
except single-family residences and duplexes, unless the latter are arranged in courtyard
or grouped settings. Such plans are applicable only to all new developments, unless
major alterations to an existing site intensify factors which affect the overall design
relationship. Minor revisions to such plans after initial plan approval may be approved
by the Zoning Administrator based upon a written record of unforeseen circumstances.
B. Enforcement.
No zoning permit may be issued until the site plan is approved by the Planning
Commission. A decision by the Zoning Administrator to deny issuance of a zoning
permit or to issue a zoning permit with conditions based upon the approved site plan
may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
C. Fees.
Processing fees shall be in accordance with the Citys fee resolution established by the
Governing Body.
D. Form and Timing of Submittal.
Site plans should be submitted to the Zoning Administrator in a format containing detail
and information required by the then current application form approved by the Zoning
Administrator and shall be submitted for review in accordance with the then current
closing date schedule adopted by the Planning Commission.
E. Number of Plan Copies.
A minimum of 15 copies are required for proper review.
F. Conditions of Approval.
1. Proposed uses are permitted in the district in which the property is located.
2. Proposed arrangement of buildings, off-street parking spaces, loading areas,
access, walkways, lighting, signage, landscaping and screening, and drainage is
compatible with adjacent land uses.
3. Vehicular ingress and egress to and from the site and circulation within the site
provides for safe, efficient and convenient movement of traffic not only within the
site, but on adjacent streets as well.
4. Site plan provides for the safe movement of pedestrians.
5. There is a sufficient mixture of grass, shrubs and trees within the interior and
perimeter (including public right-of-way) of the site so that the proposed
development will be in harmony with adjacent land uses and will provide a
pleasing appearance to the public. Any part of the site plan area not used for
buildings, structures, parking, loading or access ways shall be landscaped in
accordance with a Landscaping Plan approved in accordance with subsection
304.E of these regulations.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-53
6. All outdoor trash disposal and storage areas are screened, where necessary,
and outdoor displays appropriately located, when permitted by these regulations.
G. Assurances. Continued compliance with the requirements, terms and conditions of a
site plan approved by the City shall be a condition precedent for the issuance and
maintenance of all building, zoning and other permits and occupancy certificates for all
structures located within the area covered by said site plan
H. Design Criteria. From time to time, the Planning Commission may adopt design criteria
in the form of policy statements to assist in reviewing site plans.

b. Compatible with topographical considerations that effect the density and
scale of development; and
c. Compatible with public infrastructure limitations.
TOPOGRAPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS may involve land subject to flooding and
areas with unusual or special natural or man-made features. Areas with
INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITATIONS are areas that are not, or are not likely in the
future, to be served by a full range of urban-scale infrastructure.
2. Generally, uses which may negatively impact the health, safety, order or general
welfare of persons residing in the district or devalue property for residential
purposes will be restricted or not permitted. The regulations of this district are

open space around buildings and structures. Also the district is intended to
control density of residential development relative to the character of existing
development within and/or near the zoning/rezoning application area and the
type of infrastructure serving or planned to serve the area.
3. The location, size and shape of an area proposed for designation as the R-1B
Low Density Single-Family Residential District shall be evaluated for

residential density will have on:
1) The future development of adjacent properties according to the
density of development typical of the R-1 Single-Family
Residential District;
2) The Citys ability to provide cost-effective public services and
infrastructure; and
3) Natural or man-made topographical features which act to reduce
the capacity of land to support residential densities typical of the
R-1 Single-Family Residential District. Such topographical
features may include floodplains, areas experiencing an aircraft
noise exposure equal to or greater than 70 DNL, and areas with
infrastructure constraints.

413 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT.
The Planned Unit Development District is a Special Purpose Base Line Zoning District. The
PUD district is not defined as an overlay district and is not granted in conjunction with other
baseline or underlying zoning districts. Future development within the PUD District is based on
a Site Development Plan or map that depicts the general layout of the future land use types
planned to be developed within the PUD along with written text that explains and details the
developmental layout.
A. Residential Planned Unit Development District
1. Statement of Intent.
The purpose of the Residential Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to provide
well planned, cohesive and unified residential developments for properties held under
unified control at the time of initial Residential PUD approval. In order to achieve this
purpose, the Residential PUD review process recognizes there may be a need to
establish controls not typically required of non-unified or residential developments that
are not planned as an integrated unit. The review process also recognizes that, in order
to provide greater design flexibility for unified residential developments, it may be
necessary to deviate from: (1) the bulk and lot area requirements typical of the common
base line residential zoning districts, and (2) the requirements of the landscaping section
of these regulations, as well as, (3) the design and improvement standards of the Citys
Subdivision Regulation.
For purposes of these regulations, UNIFIED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS are
defined as the grouping of building sites, planned as an integrated unit or cluster, on
property under unified control or ownership at the time the Residential PUD District was
approved by the City. The sale, subdivision or other partition of the site after Residential
PUD approval does not exempt the project, or portions thereof, from complying with the
development standards committed to at the time of Residential PUD approval. The
submittal by the developer and the approval by the City of development plans represent
a firm commitment by the developer that development will indeed follow the approved
plans in concept, intensity of use and quantities of open space.
The protection of public safety, convenience, health and general welfare is accomplished
for a Residential PUD through a review of the size, shape, orientation and location of
differing residential land use types or densities relative to the entire tract of land subject
to the Residential PUD District. The purposes to be achieved by such a review is to
ensure that future residential uses are provided:
a. Proper ingress and egress from adjacent street rights-of-way relative to
anticipated traffic demand;
b. Sufficient land area for on-site storm water detention areas and other
drainage facilities needed to serve the residential development in compliance
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, ordinances,
resolutions, policies, procedures and permits;
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 4  ZONING DISTRICTS
4 - 116
c. Sufficient land area for common open space and recreational facilities to
serve the residential development;
d. Adequate land area to accomplish effective screening and landscaping, from
adjacent properties and / or street rights-of-way, of the planned residential
development;
The Residential PUD District is intended to encourage: (1) innovation in residential
development by permitting greater variety and flexibility in type, design and layout of
dwellings, (2) more efficient use of land by reflecting changes in the technology of
residential land development, (3) development which incorporates the best features of
modern residential design, while conserving the value of land, and (4) planned
residential developments that are designed in a manner that will produce more usable
open space, better recreational opportunities, and safer and more attractive
neighborhoods than under conventional residential zoning and development techniques.
Provided however items 1 through 4 shall be considered as guidelines only and not as
mandates or requirements of a PUD application. Other reasonable concepts of
innovative and creative development design can be considered.
As such, the Residential PUD District provides a developer with the latitude of using
innovative techniques in the development of residential uses not feasible under
application of conventional residential zoning requirements. The Residential PUD
District is intended to provide a procedure that relates the type, design and layout of
residential development to the particular site and particular demand for housing in a
manner consistent with the public health, safety and/or welfare.
The layout and character of the development subject to a Residential PUD District must
be appropriate relative to surrounding properties and conditions. As such, safeguards or
conditions for future development may be established as a part of the Residential PUD
District to ensure that the development will minimize negative impacts, if any, to the
value of surrounding property and its enjoyment by its owners or occupants.
The design of a Residential PUD District must be such that access and circulation by
firefighting equipment and other emergency vehicles are assured and are not retarded
by heavy or extensive landscaping, walls or fences or building spacing.
2. Standards for Residential Planned Unit Developments (PUD). The following
regulations shall apply to property intended for residential development which is
zoned the Residential PUD District:
a. Ownership. The entire tract of land to be established as a PUD shall be held
by a single landowner, or if there are two or more owners, the PUD
application must be filed jointly by all owners listed on the ownership list.
b. Size. There is not a minimum acreage requirement for the Residential PUD
District.
c. Uses Permitted. Any residential land use type and density, including
exceptions and special uses typical in the common base line residential
zoning districts, may be permitted within the Residential PUD District
provided the Planning Commission and Governing Body determines the land
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 4  ZONING DISTRICTS
4 - 117
uses are appropriate for the Residential PUD and the uses are specifically
listed as permitted by the text detailing the Residential PUD Site
Development Plan and further provided that mobile homes shall not be
permitted as part of any Residential PUD. A Residential PUD may include
provision for neighborhood swimming pools, neighborhood clubhouses and
other recreational areas and facilities intended for use by persons residing
within the Residential PUD.
d. Development Intensity. The level of residential development allowed within
a Residential PUD shall not exceed the level that can be adequately served
by public facilities.
1) Increased Density. A Residential PUD District may provide for a greater
number of dwelling units per gross acre than would be permitted by the
common base line residential zoning district(s) otherwise applicable to the
site. If the proposed number of dwelling units per gross acre, for the
entire Residential PUD, exceeds the density permitted by the applicable
common base line residential district(s), the Residential PUD applicant
must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission and
Governing Body that the increased density or intensity of use will not
have an undue or adverse impact on public facilities and will not interfere
with the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring properties by their owners
and / or occupants.
In the case of a common base line zoning district(s), which does not
permit residential uses, the dwelling units per gross acre calculation shall
be based on the density permitted by the R-1 Single Family Residential
District. When calculating the maximum residential density permitted
under conventional R-1 zoning, the number of dwelling units permitted
per gross acre shall be 3.52. When evaluating a proposal for increased
residential density for a Residential PUD, or specific Residential PUD
parcel, the Planning Commission and Governing Body shall review the
proposal relative to the following:
i. Areas being established for common or private recreational
amenities, such as golf courses or homeowner association owned
neighborhood swimming pools, tennis courts and playgrounds;
ii. Areas being established for perpetual common open space that are
of a character, size and shape to accommodate future recreational
use by residents of the PUD District;
iii. Areas being established as future sites for a public park or as
permanent easements for creek side hike and bike trails and / or
other public recreation and access purposes;
iv. The physical characteristics of the subject PUD parcel and its
location relative to the overall development layout of the PUD; and
v. The location, design and type of dwelling units and other uses to be
developed on land making up the subject PUD parcel.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 4  ZONING DISTRICTS
4 - 118
If increased density is not effectively accommodated by the provision
of recreational amenities and / or perpetual open space, the Planning
Commission and Governing Body may deny the proposed density
increase.
Any common open space established as a result of a decision to
increase the residential development density of a Residential PUD, or
specific Residential PUD parcel, SHALL BE set aside for the
perpetual use, benefit and enjoyment of the residents of the
Residential PUD District. As a condition of Residential PUD approval,
the Planning Commission and / or Governing Body shall require the
applicant to provide for the establishment of an agency that will own
and maintain the common open space. Such agency SHALL NOT be
dissolved or permitted to dispose of any common open space,
established to permit a Residential PUD to develop to a density
greater than that permitted under conventional residential zoning, by
sale or otherwise (except to a new agency assuming all the duties and
obligations of the original agency). If the agency fails to maintain such
common open space, or improperly disposes of the open space, or if
the applicant fails to establish the agency such action or actions shall
be considered a violation of these regulations and subject to the
penalties and / or remedies set forth in Section 903 of these
regulations.
2) Decreased Density. A Residential PUD District may be used to achieve,
and assure in perpetuity, less dense residential development than would
be permitted or assured by the common base line residential district(s)
otherwise applicable to the site. The location, size and shape of a
Residential PUD, or Residential PUD parcels, that provides for less dense
residential development than is typical of areas developed under
conventional residential zoning shall be evaluated for appropriateness
relative to the following:
i. The effect that reduced density and its proposed layout will have on
the future development of adjacent properties according to
conventional zoning and subdivision design and improvement
practices;
ii. The effect that reduced density and its proposed layout will have on
the Citys ability to provide public services and infrastructure in a
cost effect fashion; and
iii. The existence of either natural or man-made topographical features
that reduce the capacity of land to support conventional residential
densities. Such areas include floodplains, areas subject to an
aircraft noise exposure that is equal to or greater than 70 DNL, and
areas with infrastructure constraints.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 4  ZONING DISTRICTS
4 - 119
If, because of decreased residential density, infrastructure design and
improvement standards are proposed to be modified the Residential PUD
applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission and Governing Body that modified infrastructure is
appropriate in terms of the density of residential development to be
served and the present and future long-term development needs and
interests of the City. As part of this demonstration, it must be shown that
modified infrastructure (1) will not result in an undue future maintenance
burden to either residents of the PUD or the City, (2) will not adversely
affect the street and utility layout system of the general area of the City in
which the PUD District is located, and (3) will not jeopardize public health
and safety.
e. Development Standards. Subject to adequate justification being provided
by the Residential PUD applicant, the following otherwise applicable
development standards of these regulations may be deviated from as part of
approval of a Residential PUD Site Development Plan and rezoning process:
1) Minimum lot size, depth and width,
2) Maximum lot coverage,
3) Maximum building or structure height,
4) Minimum depth of required yards or building setbacks,
5) Screening and landscaping standards.
The above identified DEVIATIONS may only be granted when there is ample
evidence that such deviations will not adversely affect neighboring properties
and surrounding areas and where such deviations do not constitute the
granting of a privilege that would not be universally appropriate for other
similarly designed and situated Residential PUDs. In addition, the types of
DEVIATIONS listed above MAY ONLY BE permitted when the deviation
addresses one or more of the following development issues: (1) Protects
environmentally sensitive areas (including unusual topography; (2) Protects
existing vegetation and important views and vistas to and from the site; (3)
Enhances a projects diversity of housing type; or (4) Encourages creative
streetscape design, including the use of high quality screening walls,
increased buffering and landscape material size and quantity, pedestrian
amenities, etc.
A decision by the Planning Commission and Governing Body to authorize
less stringent requirements from the otherwise applicable development
standards of these regulations, OR to require the establishment of MORE
RESTRICTIVE requirements, SHALL BE specified as part of the Residential
PUD development provisions. Such changes from otherwise applicable
standards may be specific to certain Residential PUD parcels or may be
applied to the entire Residential PUD.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 4  ZONING DISTRICTS
4 - 120
3. Preservation of Natural Features. For all properties included within the perimeter
of a Residential PUD, preservation of mature trees, vegetative cover, watercourses
and other natural site features SHOULD BE considered. Abrupt changes in natural
slope SHOULD BE avoided. Preservation SHOULD BE directed toward:
a. Enhancing the quality of new development;
b. Protecting the natural environment;
c. Providing buffering between new development and surrounding properties;
and
d. Preserving the character of existing neighborhoods.
4. Review Procedure. Applications for a Residential Planned Unit Development shall
involve Planning Commission review and approval of both a Preliminary Residential
PUD and a Final Residential PUD. A Preliminary or Final Residential PUD
application shall be processed in the same manner as a rezoning amendment,
except that a proposal to establish a Residential PUD can only be initiated by the
owner of the property and, the Governing Body does not review or act on a
Preliminary Residential PUD application. Written notice to property owners and
advertisement of a Public Hearing before the Planning Commission, as required by
subsection 1100.E of these regulations, shall be provided for the Planning
Commissions review of a Preliminary Residential PUD application, as well as a Final
Residential PUD application. As is the case for any rezoning case, final approval or
denial of an application to establish a Residential PUD District rests with the
Governing Body. The same requirements and provisions for filing of protest
petitions, as is required for any other rezoning case, also apply to an application to
establish a Residential Planned Unit Development (PUD) District.
a. Planning Commission Consideration of a Preliminary Residential PUD
Application. A completed application for Preliminary Residential PUD
approval shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator, or their designated
agent, in a form established by the Administrator. The completed application
shall be accompanied by a certified ownership list, a Preliminary Residential
PUD Site Development Plan and a non-refundable filing fee, as established
by the Fee Resolution of the Governing Body of the City of Derby, Kansas, to
help defray the cost of processing the PUD application. A Preliminary
Residential PUD Site Development Plan shall not be forwarded to the
Planning Commission for review until a completed application has been filed
with the Zoning Administrator along with the required ownership list and filing
fee.
At the advertised Public Hearing for the Planning Commissions review of the
Preliminary Residential PUD application, the Commission shall review the
request for the PUD District relative to:
1) Compatibility with the Comprehensive Plan;
2) Findings in accordance with Section 1100.C of these regulations;
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 4  ZONING DISTRICTS
4 - 121
3) Requirements of this Section (413); and
4) Other requirements and/or or standards of these regulations.
During the course of Preliminary Residential PUD review, the Planning
Commission may, as a condition of approval, require changes to be depicted
on the Residential PUD Site Development Plan and / or its accompanying
written provisions. If the Planning Commission recommends denial or
disapproval of a Preliminary Residential PUD, the Preliminary PUD
application shall be forwarded to the Governing Body for final action.
Although the Governing Body does not normally review a Residential PUD
application in its preliminary form, the applicant may appeal to the Governing
Body Preliminary Residential PUD approval conditions established by the
Planning Commission and the Planning Commission may request that the
Preliminary Residential PUD be reviewed by the Governing Body. Any such
appeal of approval conditions by the applicant shall be made in writing and
filed with the Zoning Administrator within 30 DAYS after the date of the
Planning Commissions requirement. The written appeal must specify what
factor(s) or requirement(s), or lack of requirement(s), established by the
Planning Commission are the subject of the appeal. The written appeal must
include statements as to why the appeal should be granted. Should the
Planning Commission determine that review of the Preliminary Residential
PUD by the Governing Body is advisable, then a written statement shall be
provided that outlines what factors or issues warrant Governing Body review
of the preliminary application.
b. Preliminary Residential Site Development Plan  Contents and
Submission Requirements. Fifteen (15) paper copies and an electronic
copy of a Preliminary Residential Site Development Plan shall accompany an

Plan, and its accompanying written provisions, are in SUBSTANTIAL
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 4  ZONING DISTRICTS
4 - 127
COMPLIANCE with the approval conditions established for the
Preliminary Residential PUD. THIS IS PROVIDED THE COMMISSION
DETERMINES:
i. That proposed landscaping and screening meets or exceeds the
requirements of Section 304 of these regulations; and
ii. That all other requirements of Preliminary Residential PUD approval
have been satisfied.
3) For purposes of this subsection, lack of substantial compliance shall
mean any of the following:
i. Increase in the density or intensity of residential uses, for any PUD
parcel, which is more than five percent.
ii. Increase in lot coverage, on any given PUD parcel, of more than five
percent.

Hearing required for a Final Residential PUD application. In addition,
based on information received at the Final PUD Public Hearing, the
Planning Commission is specifically authorized to modify Preliminary
PUD approval conditions or establish new conditions for Final PUD
approval.
g. Report of Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall have
prepared a Staff Report that reviews a proposed Residential PUD in light of
the following:
1) The Comprehensive Plan;
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 4  ZONING DISTRICTS
4 - 128
2) PUD standards of this Section; and
3) Other requirements of these regulations including, but not limited to,
Section 304 (Landscaping, Screening and Lighting) and Article 5 (Off-
Street Parking and Loading).
If either EXCEPTIONS OR SPECIAL USES, typical of the common residential
base line zoning districts, are proposed to be approved by way of a Residential
PUD, the Staff Report shall specifically address this proposal by recommending
approval or disapproval of the request. If approval is recommended, the Staff
Report shall provide approval conditions, if any, designed to help assure that
such uses are compatible with surrounding properties and the nature of the
Residential PUD and are therefore appropriate for including as part of the
Residential PUD District.
If the applicant proposes DEVIATIONS, provided for by subsection 413.B.5, the
Staff Report shall specifically address this proposal by recommending approval
or disapproval of the request. If approval is recommended, the Staff Report shall
provide approval conditions, if any, which are designed to help assure that such
deviations will not negatively affect either properties within the perimeter of the
proposed Residential PUD District or in close proximity to it.
h. Appeals of Final Action. The Governing Bodys decision on a Residential
PUD, or amendments thereto, SHALL BE the final local action. Appeals of
the Governing Bodys final action shall be taken to district court.
i. Amendments to Residential PUDs. Approved Residential Planned Unit
Developments may be amended in whole or in part. The addition of a use to
an existing Residential PUD District MAY ONLY BE accomplished by way of
a Residential PUD amendment. Amendments shall follow the same
procedures required for consideration and approval of the application that first
established the Residential PUD District.
1) Notification. Although the notification area for amendment of a portion of
a Residential PUD is the same as required when the entire Residential
PUD was first approved, when an amendment is sought that pertains to
only a given PUD parcel, and the overall Residential PUD is under
multiple ownerships, only the signature(s) of the owner(s) who owns
property within the given PUD parcel requested for amendment is(are)
required to sign the amendment application.
When the Governing Body considers the proposed amendment, they
shall be provided the following:
i. The percentage of land area within the legal protest area, in
accordance with the terms, conditions, and procedures established
in K.S.A. 12-757, as amended, subject to valid protest petitions; and
ii. The percentage of land area within the Residential PUD District,
excluding the amendment application area (PUD Parcel), subject to
valid protest petitions.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 4  ZONING DISTRICTS
4 - 129
If the owners of 20% or more of the land area, within the legal notification
area outside the perimeter of the Residential PUD, OR of 20% or more of
the land area within the perimeter of Residential PUD, excluding the area
of the PUD subject to the amendment, file valid protest petitions against
the proposed amendment, then approval of the amendment by the
Governing Body shall require at least a 3/4 vote of all the members of the
Governing Body.
2) Final Approval. Any special requirements which are imposed upon the
Residential PUD amendment shall be referenced on an amended PUD
Site Development Plan, and if applicable, referenced in the PUDs written
provisions. At the discretion of the Governing Body, a public hearing may
be held to consider the proposed amendment. In accordance with the
terms, conditions and procedures established in K.S.A. 12-757, as
amended, the Governing Body may adopt the recommendation of the
Planning Commission, override the Commissions recommendation or
return the proposed Residential PUD amendment to the Planning
Commission for reconsideration.
j. Adjustments to Residential PUDs.
1) The Zoning Administrator may approve adjustments of a minor nature to
approved Residential PUDs, unless the Zoning Administrator finds that
the proposed adjustment would have one or more of the following
negative impacts:
i. Would adversely affect the safety and convenience of vehicular and
pedestrian circulation in the vicinity of the subject tract, including
traffic reasonably expected to be generated by the proposed use
and other uses in the area given the existing zoning, existing land
uses and proposed land uses in the area;
ii. Would potentially create more adverse impacts on existing or
permitted uses in surrounding areas than which reasonably might
result from development of the site in strict compliance with the
standard requested for adjustment;
iii. Would not be compatible with existing or permitted uses on abutting
sites, in terms of adjusted building height, setbacks and open
spaces, bulk and scale, landscaping, parking, circulation and/or
other development features; or
iv. Would be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare and/or
materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity for
reasons articulated in writing by the Zoning Administrator.
2) The developer shall have the burden of demonstrating that the proposed
adjustment meets the applicable review criteria. IN NO CASE SHALL the
Zoning Administrator approve an adjustment that allows any of the
following:
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 4  ZONING DISTRICTS
4 - 130
i. More than a 5-foot or 10 percent increase in building height,
whichever is less;
ii. More than a 5 percent increase in lot coverage;
iii. More than a 10 percent increase in residential unit density, when
calculated on a total aggregate project basis;
iv. The addition of a new use to the list of uses allowed within the
perimeter of a given PUD parcel;
v. More than a 5-foot or a 10 percent reduction in building setback
lines referenced on the Residential PUDs Site Development Plan,
whichever is less, provided however, such setback lines have not
been platted as part of a subdivision plat. In the case of a platted
setback(s), proposals to reduce such setback(s) shall be processed
as a Vacation Case as provided for by Article 10 of the Subdivision
Regulation.
3) When an application for Residential PUD adjustment has been denied or
when such application has been approved with conditions or changes
unacceptable to the applicant, the applicant may file for a Residential
PUD amendment [See Subsection 415(D)(9)].
k. Successive Applications. In the event the Governing Body denies an
application for initial Residential PUD approval or denies an application for a
Residential PUD amendment, a similar rezoning application shall not be
refiled within three months from the advertised Public Hearing date of the
denied application. The Public Hearing date shall be the date of the hearing
when the Planning Commission acted on the Final Residential PUD
application.
5. Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following terms are defined:
APPROPRIATE - Sympathetic, or fitting to the context of the overall Residential Site
Development Plan and the community as a whole.

ZONING REGULATIONS Article 5  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
5 - 138
ARTICLE 5. OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
500 OFF STREET PARKING
In any zoning district, all structures built and any new uses established shall provide required
off-street parking spaces, off-street loading areas and vehicle stacking spaces for drive-through
facilities in accordance with the standards of this Article. When an existing structure or use is
expanded in area, off-street parking shall be provided for the entire structure or use in
accordance with the off-street parking schedule of Section 501. Plans showing the layout and
design of all required off-street parking spaces, stacking spaces for drive-through facilities and
loading areas must be submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator before a zoning
permit and/or building permit is issued.
A. General Provisions.
1. Use of Required Off-Street Parking Areas: Except for parking required for single
and two-family residential uses, required off-street parking spaces shall be reserved
for the sole purpose of providing space for temporary parking of operable vehicles
used by the occupants, employees, visitors or patrons of the building or lot being
served by the parking facility. Such required parking spaces shall not be used for the
storage, sale or display of goods or materials, including shopping cart storage
corrals, or for the sale, repair or servicing of vehicles. Parking areas providing
required spaces shall not be used to satisfy required off-street parking for new
structures or additions to existing buildings, structures or uses of land. Required
parking spaces for multiple-family residential and non-residential uses shall be
maintained and shall not be reduced so long as the main building, structure or use
remains, unless an equivalent number of such spaces are provided elsewhere.
2. Parking Space Dimension: Except as provided below, a required off-street parking
space shall be at least 8 feet 6 inches in width and at least 19 feet in length,
exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps or columns. In any off-street parking
facility with 100 or more vehicle spaces, a maximum of 10 percent of the required
number of vehicle parking spaces may be designed for compact vehicles only. Such
compact vehicle only spaces shall be appropriately signed. For purpose of these
regulations, a compact vehicle is one whose length does not exceed 14 feet. The
required minimum dimensions of a compact vehicle only parking space are 8 feet in
width and 16 feet in length.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 5  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
5 - 139
3. Access: For non-residential and multiple-family residential developments, each
required off-street parking space shall open directly upon a circulation aisle with a
width adequate to provide a safe and efficient means of vehicular movement and
access. The minimum width of all two way circulation aisles shall be not less than 24
feet. The minimum width of one way circulation aisles shall be as follows:
MINIMUM WIDTH OF
ONE WAY AISLES
ANGLE
OF PARKING
22 feet 90 degree
17 feet 60 degree
12 feet 45 degree
11 feet 30 degree
13 feet Parallel
For non-residential and multiple-family residential developments, no vehicular
parking space shall be designed to exit or back directly onto a public street. Back
out parking within a public right-of-way is prohibited unless specifically approved by
the Governing Body. Such arrangements are discouraged, except for unusual
circumstances and where the traffic safety of the public can still be protected.
4. Open and Enclosed Parking: Required off-street parking spaces open to the sky
may be located in any yard, except that in residential districts required parking
spaces shall not be located in a required front yard, unless specifically authorized as
part of an exception. Vehicle parking structures, such as garages, canopies and
carports, which are attached to the principal building, shall observe the required
building setbacks identified for the principal building. Detached accessory garages
and carports shall be subject to the provisions for accessory uses contained in
Section 600 of these regulations and, in particular, the bulk regulations identified in
Section 600.C.
5. Computing Parking and Loading Requirements:
a. MULTIPLE USES: Lots containing more than one use shall provide parking
and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses,
unless a shared parking plan is approved pursuant to Section 500.A.8 of this
Article.
b. FRACTIONS: When measurements of the number of required parking
spaces result in fractions, any fraction of less than one-half shall be
disregarded and any fraction of one-half or more shall be rounded upward to
the next highest whole number.
c. FLOOR AREA: Unless otherwise noted in these regulations, all square
footage based parking and loading standards shall be computed based on
gross building area. However, off-street parking shall be adequate to serve
the entire site, including outdoor display areas and other outdoor uses.
d. EMPLOYEE AND OCCUPANT-BASED STANDARDS: For the purpose of
computing parking requirements based on the number of employees or
occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons

5 - 140
working on any single shift or the maximum occupant capacity as established
by the adopted building code of the City, whichever is applicable.
e. UNLISTED USES: Upon receiving a development application for a use not
specifically listed in Section 501, the Zoning Administrator shall apply the
parking and loading requirements specified for the listed use deemed most
similar to the use proposed in the application as determined by the Zoning
Administrator.
6. Design and Maintenance:
a. DESIGN: Required off-street parking spaces shall comply with design
standards relating to curb length, stall depth, driveway width, island width,
barriers and ingress and egress as may be established from time to time by
the City. Such off-street parking spaces may be open to the sky or enclosed
in a structure. Except for the B-2A BUCKNER BUSINESS DISTRICT,
required off-street parking for single and two-family dwellings shall not be
located within a required front yard.
1) Additional accessory off-street parking on driveways for single and twofamily
dwellings and all types of manufactured and mobile homes is
permitted; provided that the parked vehicle does not overhang into the
street right-of-way (front lot line) and the total surfaced area within the
front yard setback does not exceed twelve-hundred (1,200) square feet or
fifty (50) percent of the dwellings required yard, whichever is less.
2) Required yard areas, except where paved for vehicle parking, loading,
and circulation aisles, shall be landscaped with grass, shrubs, trees, or
groundcover, and shall be maintained in good condition.
3) In the B-2A BUCKNER BUSINESS DISTRICT, required parking for
either residential or commercial uses may be located in the required front
yard and may be extended 5 feet into adjacent street right-of-way.
b. SURFACING: All required off-street parking spaces and driveways for
single-family and two-family dwellings shall be surfaced with either poured in
place concrete, asphaltic concrete, brick or similar paving material approved
by the Zoning Administrator. All accessory off-street parking located in the
front yard of a single or two-family dwelling shall be paved.
1) For driveways existing prior to December 1, 1994, which serve a singlefamily
or two-family dwelling and do not meet the above surfacing
standard, one half inch diameter crushed rock or larger may be used as
replacement surfacing material provided it is contained by curbs of
concrete, brick, wood or similar material. The December 1, 1994
grandfathering date shall also apply to unpaved, all weather surfaced
accessory off-street parking spaces located in the front yard of a singlefamily
or two-family residential use. Such unpaved areas shall be
maintained in good condition and free from weeds, grass, trash or other
debris.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 5  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
5 - 141
2) In the R-1C Suburban Single-Family Residential District only, driveways
and off-street parking areas located in front of the principal structure
existing prior to July 1, 2013 which do not meet the above surfacing
standard may utilize one half inch diameter crushed rock or larger as
replacement surfacing material provided it is maintained in good condition
and free from weeds, grass, trash or other debris. Existing and new
accessory off-street parking spaces and drives providing access thereto,
which are located in a side or rear yard of the principal structure, may be
surfaced with an all weather surface. Owners of properties maintaining
permitted crushed rock or all weather driveways shall be responsible for
keeping the street right-of-way clear of any debris resulting from
accessing the public street from a private drive.
3) All off-street parking lots and loading areas and all driveways serving
multiple-family, institutional, commercial or industrial uses shall be
surfaced with poured in place concrete, asphaltic concrete or other
comparable paving material approved by the Zoning Administrator, and
shall be maintained in good condition and free of weeds, dust, trash and
other debris. Except as provided below, all such parking lots and loading
areas shall be provided 6-inch tall, poured in place, perimeter concrete
curbs. In some instances, precast and permanently pinned in place
wheel stops or guards may be used along the perimeter of the parking lot
instead of poured in place concrete curbing if such alternative is in
accordance with the approved drainage plan required by Section
500.A.6.g of these regulations.
4) All portions of a driveway that is within street right-of-way shall be paved
and designed to the standards of the City Engineer.
c. SCREENING: Screening for parking spaces and loading areas is
incorporated into the general screening and landscaping provisions of
Section 304 of these regulations.
d. LIGHTING: Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking spaces
shall be shaded so that no direct light is cast upon property located in a
residential district and so that glare is not a problem to traffic on any public
street.
e. LOCATION: All parking spaces required to serve structures or uses
shall be located on the same zoning lot as the structure or use served unless
an exception is obtained under Section 502 of this Article.
f. DESIGNATION OF SPACES: All vehicular parking spaces and
associated circulation aisles shall be clearly delineated through the use of
pavement markings.
g. DRAINAGE: All parking facilities shall be graded and/or designed
with storm drainage facilities that are in accordance with an approved
drainage plan and all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules,
regulations, ordinances, resolutions, policies, procedures and permits so that
surface water is channeled away from adjoining properties to a storm water
detention facility or an approved storm drainage system.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 5  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
5 - 142
7. Plans and Approval Required: Plans showing the layout and design of all
required off-street parking, stacking spaces for drive-through facilities and loading
areas shall be submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator and/or City
Engineer or their designated agent(s), prior to issuance of a building permit for the
parking lot itself or as part of a building permit application for a larger related project.
Before approving any parking layout, the Zoning Administrator and/or City Engineer
shall determine that the spaces provided are usable and meet standard design
criteria and all parking requirements of these regulations.
8. Shared Parking: The Zoning Administrator may authorize a reduction in the number
of required parking spaces for multiple use developments which are under a single
ownership, and which have different peak parking demands and operating hours.
Shared or collective parking for such multiple use developments shall be subject to
the following standards.
a. SHARED PARKING ANALYSIS: A parking analysis acceptable to the
Zoning Administrator shall be submitted which clearly establishes that uses
will make use of the shared spaces at different times of the day, week, month
or year. The study shall:
1) Address the size and type of activities, the composition of tenants, the
rate of turnover for proposed shared spaces, and the anticipated peak
parking and traffic loads;
2) Provide for a reduction by no more than 30 percent of the combined
parking required for each use; and
3) Provide for no reduction in the number of spaces reserved for persons
with disabilities.
b. AGREEMENT FOR SHARED PARKING PLAN: A shared parking plan shall
be enforced through written agreement. An attested copy of the agreement,
in a form acceptable to the City of Derby, shall be submitted to the Register of
Deeds for filing of record. A copy of the recorded agreement shall be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator prior to the issuance of a building
permit.
c. REVOCATION: Failure to comply with the shared parking provisions of this
section, including any provision of an Agreement for Shared Parking Plan
executed in accordance with Subsection 500.A.8.b above, shall constitute a
violation of these regulations and shall specifically be cause for revocation of
a Certificate of Occupancy.
9. Parking Spaces for Persons with Disabilities: A portion of the total number of
required vehicular parking spaces in each off-street parking facility shall be
specifically designated, located and reserved for use by persons with disabilities in
such numbers and according to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities
Act.
10. Nonconforming Use Status: Any single-family or two-family land use that was
legally established shall not be deemed nonconforming solely as a result of providing
fewer off-street parking spaces than required by this Article.

ZONING REGULATIONS Article 5  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
5 - 146
502 EXCEPTIONS FOR PARKING
In order to provide up to 50 percent of required off-street parking, at a location that is off-site or
separated from the lot on which the use being served is located, an exception may be granted
for the establishment of such an off-site parking area. Such parking area shall be located on
property that is assigned the same zoning district classification as required for the use being
served or be located on property zoned a classification which specifically permits, as a part of
the districts Use Limitations, outdoor customer and employee parking. Approval of the
exception shall be subject to the following standards:
A. NECESSITY.
The applicant shall demonstrate that it is not feasible to locate all required parking on the
same lot as the use being served.
B. LOCATION.
Parking provided under this section must be within 300 feet, as measured along the
shortest legal and practical walking route, from the boundary of the zoning lot on which
the use to be served is located. Off-site parking spaces shall not be separated from the
use to be served by an arterial street, expressway or freeway unless a grade-separated
pedestrian walkway is provided.
C. USE.
The parking area shall be used for passenger vehicles only, and in no case shall it be
used for sales, repair work, storage, dismantling or servicing of any vehicle, equipment,
materials or supplies. Only such signs as are necessary for the proper identification and
operation of the parking lot shall be permitted. The size and location of such signs shall
be established as part of the exception review process.
D. IMPROVEMENTS.
1. Parking areas and driveways providing ingress and egress to parking areas shall be
paved with poured in place concrete or asphaltic concrete and shall be provided
perimeter curbing as required by Section 500(A)(6)(b) of these regulations. Paved
areas shall be maintained in good condition and free of weeds, dust, trash and
debris.
2. Parking areas shall be provided adequate guards to prevent the overhanging of
vehicles beyond property lines or into landscaping areas. Parking areas shall
include permanent pavement markings to delineate individual parking spaces and
circulation aisles.
3. If lighting facilities are provided for the parking area, such lighting shall be so
arranged and installed to deflect or direct light away from any adjacent residential
use or residential district. Such lighting shall also be arranged and installed so that
glare is not a problem to traffic on any public street.
ZONING REGULATIONS Article 5  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
5 - 147
4. Solid visual screening (such as a wall or fence constructed of brick, stone, masonry,
architectural tile, concrete, wood or a combination of those materials, but not
including the use of woven wire, welded wire or metal panels) not less than six feet in
height, shall be required to be erected along any property line adjacent to or
adjoining any residential district to reduce noise, eliminate the passage of light from
vehicles and prevent the blowing of debris. Whenever solid visual screening is
required within a required front yard, it shall not be higher than three feet.
5. When located in a residential district or adjacent to a residential district, vehicle
parking shall not be located within the required front yard setback and such front
yard shall remain unpaved and shall be landscaped.
6. Additional improvements necessary to protect adjacent property owners and the
public interest may be established as a part of the exception review process. Such
improvements may include, but are not be limited to, proper methods for handling
drainage, controlling access to adjacent public rights-of-way, establishment of
setbacks, providing screening and landscaping including requirements for the proper
maintenance thereof.
E. AGREEMENT FOR OFF-SITE PARKING.
In the event that required off-street parking areas are not located on the same zoning
lot as the use being served, a written agreement shall be required. An attested copy
of the agreement shall be submitted to the Register of Deeds for filing of record. The
agreement shall be on standard forms obtained from the Office of the Zoning
Administrator. A copy of the recorded agreement shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator prior to the issuance of a building permit. Failure to comply with any
provision of an Agreement for Off-Site Parking executed in accordance with this
Section 502 shall constitute a violation of these regulations and shall specifically be
cause for revocation of an occupancy certificate.
F. PARKING FOR RELIGIOUS AND EDUCATIONAL USES.
For religious and educational uses, up to 50 percent of required off-street parking
may be separated from the zoning lot on which such use is located by a public street
or alley and still be considered as on-site parking, provided that such parking facility
is: 1) under the same ownership as the use being served and 2) is within 300 feet of
a boundary line of the zoning lot for such use.

8 - 177
ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES
800 PURPOSE
This Article provides for the regulation of nonconforming lots, structures and uses and
specifies those circumstances and conditions under which such nonconformities shall be
permitted to continue. The ability to continue a nonconforming lot, building, structure or
use shall not be affected by a change in ownership or operator of the structure or use,
unless such ownership or operator is a condition attached to an approval for a special
use or exception. For the purposes of these regulations, nonconformities are defined as
follows:
A. Nonconforming Lot of Record: A zoning lot which is shown by a recorded plat or
deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a
time when the creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have
been prohibited by any zoning regulations and such lot now neither complies with the lot
area requirements or the width for any permitted uses in the zoning district in which it is
located.
B. Nonconforming Structure: An existing building or structure which does not comply
with the maximum lot coverage and height or the minimum yard requirements which are
applicable to new structures in the zoning district in which it is located.
C. Nonconforming Use: An existing use of a structure or land which does not
comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning district in which it is
located.

regulations, a single-family detached dwelling or a residential design manufactured
home which complies with the restrictions in Section 801.A.2 may be erected on a
lot(s) in the same ownership that is not less than 50 feet in width and that consists
entirely of a tract of land that:
a. Has less than the prescribed minimum lot area, width or depth, or all three,
and that
b. Is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and
individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of
such size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any
zoning regulations.
2. Construction permitted by Section 801.A.1 shall comply with all of the regulations
except lot area, width and depth applicable to single-family dwellings and residential
design manufactured homes in the zoning district in which the lot in question is
located; provided, however, that the following side yard requirements shall apply in
place of the side yard requirements otherwise applicable:
a. The structure shall be placed on the lot so as to provide a yard on each side
of the dwelling.
b. The sum of the widths of the two side yards on each lot shall not be less than
the smaller of:
1) 20% of the width of the lot, or
2) the minimum total for both side yards prescribed by the bulk regulations
for the applicable zoning district.
c. In any case, neither side yard resulting from the methods permitted in Section
801.A.2 shall be less than three feet wide.
B. In Districts Other Than Residential Districts.
1. Notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other provision of these regulations,
a structure designed for any permitted use may be erected on a lot of the type
described in Section 801.A.1.

except lot area, width and depth applicable in the zoning district in which the lot in
question is located; provided, however, that the width of any side yard must not be
less than that derived by applying the following formula (wherein the width of any
side yard required = w):

802 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
A. Authority to Continue. Any structure which is devoted to a use which is permitted in
the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located on a lot which does not
comply with the applicable lot size requirements and/or the applicable bulk regulations,
may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions in
Sections 802.B through 802.D.
B. Enlargement, Repairs and Alterations. Any such structure described in Section 802.A
may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or structurally altered; provided that (1) no such
enlargement, maintenance, repair or alteration shall create any additional nonconformity

or 801.B, whichever is applicable.
C. Damage.
1. In the event any structure described in Section 802.A is damaged by any means
except flooding, to the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, such

percent of damage to the value of the structure based on data submitted by the
applicant may appeal such determination to the Board of Zoning Appeals. (See
Section 805.)
D. Moving. No structure described in Section 802.A shall be moved in whole or in part for
any distance to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire

use; provided, however, that this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any
violation of Sections 803.C through 803.J.
2. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public
official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such
structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition provided that
such restoration will not be in violation of Section 803.F of these regulations.
C. Structural Alteration. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be structurally altered unless the entire structure and use
thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located.
D. Extension.
1. Extension of a nonconforming use is permitted within a nonconforming structure to
any portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on
the effective date of the original City Zoning Regulations or a subsequent
amendment to these regulations that caused such use to become nonconforming;
provided, however, that no structural alterations shall be made unless such changes,
and the use thereof, conform to the regulations of the district in which the structure is
located.
2. Extension of a nonconforming use of a part of a structure is not permitted if all or
substantially all of the structure is designed or intended for a use which is permitted
in the district in which the structure is located. Additionally, except as specifically

changed to any other nonconforming use.
3. Extension of a nonconforming use is not permitted to any structure or land area other

percent of damage to the value of the structure based on data submitted by the
applicant, may appeal such determination to the Board of Zoning Appeals. (See
Section 805.)
G. Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be
moved in whole or in part for any distance to any other location on the same or any other
lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. No
nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance to any
other location on the same or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to
all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. (See
Section 303.M for moving structures and City ordinance on moving buildings.)
H. Change in Use. If no structural alterations are made other than those necessary to
repair or maintain the structure as described in Section803.B.1, a nonconforming use of
a structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or similar type
as the existing nonconforming use or to a more restrictive nonconforming use. Similarly,
a nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or involving only an accessory
structure may also be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or similar type
as the existing nonconforming use or to a more restrictive nonconforming use. When a
nonconforming use has been changed to a more restrictive nonconforming use, it shall
not thereafter be changed back to a less restrictive nonconforming use. Additionally,
when a nonconforming use has been changed to any permitted use, it shall not
thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use. In determining whether a change
in use is the same, similar or more restrictive, the Zoning Administrator shall consider
the changes in environmental factors such as outdoor storage, loading, traffic, parking,
noise, lighting, air pollution, hours of operation, screening and other factors, as well as
the provisions available in Section 805 of these regulations.

A. Any use previously established as an exception by prior zoning regulations of the City
may continue in such status with any conditions attached thereto which may have been
the basis of their prior approval, unless application is made for such change in status as
may be permitted by these regulations or such uses have now been classified as
permitted uses under these regulations.
B. Where a use existed prior to the effective date of these regulations and any prior
regulations and was or is now classified as a special use or exception, it shall be
considered to be a lawful conforming special use or exception. Enlargement, extension
or alterations to existing structures or uses for expansion of such lawful uses may be
made within the area of the lot included in the ownership existing as of the effective date
of these regulations, and shall be subject to all requirements set forth in these
regulations as if they were permitted uses.
C. Whenever land is annexed that has been used for a quarry or sand pit operation which
has previously been zoned by Sedgwick County as a conditional use, it shall be
considered to be a lawful conforming special use in any district provided the same

dedicated public or other utility easement and/or known utility improvement or
installation.
b. An accessory structure that is movable or will not, in the judgment of the
Zoning Administrator, significantly obstruct a public or utility easement or
effect the maintenance, repair, replacement or reconstruction of a public or
utility improvement or installation located within any such easement, including
any authorized future use thereof, may be located within or project over such
utility easement, improvement or installation; provided that the owner thereof
shall post and continuously maintain in a conspicuous place upon such
building or structure the following notice:
This structure is located within a public utility easement. Neither the City of
Derby nor any utility company entitled to use this easement is liable for
damage to or destruction of this structure as a result of maintenance, repair
or replacement activities, or installation of new facilities, within this

height, and bulk of (1) all present and proposed structures, (2) drives and
parking spaces, and loading areas, (3) building setback lines in relation to lot
lines, (4) waste disposal areas, (5) the use to be made of such present and

applicant. When the Zoning Administrator refuses to issue a zoning permit, he shall
advise the applicant in writing of the reasons for the disapproval.
6. Period of Validity. A zoning permit shall become null and void 60 days after the
date on which it is issued, unless within said period construction, reconstruction,
moving, or structural alteration of a structure is commenced or a use is commenced.
An application for an extension of time to continue the project is required when the
construction or work is abandoned or suspended for any 120 day period after such
permit is issued. The Zoning Administrator may grant reasonable extensions of time
provided no changes have been made in any applicable regulations. In the event
changes have occurred, application must be made for a new permit based on the
provisions of the new or amended regulations in order to continue the project, unless
Section 200.G applies pertaining to vesting of residential developments. [See

F. Conditions. In granting an exception by permit, the Board may attach such conditions
upon the property and/or the applicant benefited by the exception it deems necessary to
address issues raised during the application and hearing process. The exception by
permit is subject to ongoing compliance with these conditions and shall lapse and
become ineffective if such conditions are not continually complied with. Such conditions
may include, but not be limited to, further restrictions on bulk regulations; length and time
of operation and ownership limitations; screening, landscaping and fencing; provision of
utilities, drainage, sidewalks and other public improvements; additional access or access
control; off-street parking and loading requirements; and platting, dedications and/or

conditions will be carried out at a future date may be required to be filed with the
Sedgwick County Register of Deeds.
In lieu of actual construction of a required off-street parking improvement or the initial
provisions for screening required under these regulations, the Board may accept, in the
name of the City, a corporate surety bond, cashier's check, escrow account or other like
security in an amount to be fixed by the Board and conditioned upon actual completion

the boundaries or regulations contained in these regulations by amendment, in accordance with
the terms, conditions and procedures established in K.S.A. 12-757, as amended.
A. Proposal for Amendments. A proposal for such amendment may be initiated by the
Governing Body or the Planning Commission. If such proposed amendment is not a
general revision of the existing regulations and affects specific property, the amendment
may be initiated by application of the owner of the property affected, filed with the Zoning
Administrator and placed in such form and including such information as shall be
prescribed from time to time by the Planning Commission. Any such amendment, if in
accordance with the land use plan or the land use element of a comprehensive plan,
shall be presumed to be reasonable.
B. Public Hearing. Prior to voting on an application for an amendment to the Zoning Map
(or issuance of a special use permit), the Planning Commission shall hold a public
hearing on the application and notice shall be provided in accordance with K.S.A. 12-
757, as amended.
C. Matters for Consideration. When approving or disapproving a rezoning request
affecting specific property, consideration may include, but is not limited to, the following
matters:
1. The character of the neighborhood.
2. The zoning and uses of properties nearby.
3. The suitability of the subject property for the uses to which it has been restricted.
4. The extent to which removal of the restrictions will detrimentally affect nearby
property.
5. The length of time the subject property has remained vacant as zoned.
6. The gain to the public health, safety, and welfare by the possible diminution in value
of the applicant's property as compared to the hardship imposed on the applicant if
his requests were denied.
7. The impact of the proposed development on community facilities.
8. The opposition or support of neighborhood residents.
9. The conformance of the requested change to the City's master or comprehensive
plan.
10. The recommendations of a permanent or professional planning staff.
The above-listed factors are only suggested factors which may be important for
consideration when approving or disapproving a rezoning request affecting specific
property. The above-listed factors are not exclusive and other factors which may be
important for consideration of a rezoning request may be considered.

disapproves a zoning change, a written protest petition against a proposed amendment
for a specific property or special use may be filed in accordance with the provisions of
K.S.A. 12-757, as amended.
E. Vote by Extraordinary Majority Required.
1. Protest Petition. If a valid protest petition against an application for amendment or
special use is filed in the office of the City Clerk in accordance with the provisions
and meeting the requirements of K.S.A. 12-757, as amended, any ordinance
adopting such amendment shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 vote of all of
the members of the Governing Body.

deny a proposal for which the Planning Commission recommended approval, then
the Governing Body may override the Planning Commission recommendation,
without a remand, by at least a 2/3 vote of all members of the Governing Body.

1101 SPECIAL USES.
Certain uses which might have the potential of creating an adverse effect upon nearby
properties or upon the character and future development of specific zoning districts are
permitted as "special uses" within such zoning districts when their proposed location is
supplemented by conditions designed to promote compatibility of the use with the surrounding
property, the neighborhood and the applicable zoning district.
A. Procedure:
Although the Official Zoning Map of the City is not amended, the procedure for approval
of a special use permit shall otherwise be the same as for an amendment to change a
zoning district classification or boundary in accordance with the terms, conditions and
procedures established in K.S.A. 12-757, as amended, and Section 1100 of these
regulations; provided, that any additional requirements which are further imposed upon
the special use shall be made a part of the effectuating ordinance. Concurrent
applications may be processed for amending a propertys zoning district classification
and approving a special use on the same property.
B. Fees.
The required fees shall be paid in advance by the owner of any property at the time of
making application for a special use permit in accordance with the established fee
resolution approved by the Governing Body.

Special Use approved in accordance with this Section shall be conditioned upon the
owner/operator of the approved WECS annually presenting evidence to the Citys
Zoning Administrator that the above-referenced insurance is still in effect.

1102 PROJECT REVIEW.
In accordance with K.S.A. 12-748, whenever the Planning Commission has adopted and
certified the Comprehensive Plan or one or more major sections or functional subdivisions
thereof, no public improvement, public facility or public utility of a type embraced within the
recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan or portion thereof shall be constructed without
first being submitted to and being approved by the Planning Commission as being in conformity
with the Plan. If the Planning Commission does not make a report within 60 days, the project
shall be deemed to have been approved by the Planning Commission. If the Planning
Commission finds that any such proposed public improvement, facility or utility does not
conform to the Plan, the Commission shall submit, in writing to the Governing Body, the manner
in which such proposed improvement, facility or utility does not conform. The Governing Body
may override the Plan and the report of the Planning Commission, and the Plan for the area
concerned shall be deemed to have been amended.
Whenever the Planning Commission has reviewed a capital improvement program and found
that a specific public improvement, public facility or public utility of a type embraced within the
recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan or portion thereof is in conformity with such Plan,
no further approval by the Planning Commission is necessary under this section. In the event
that certain public improvements, facilities or utilities of a type embraced within the
recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan are classified as special uses or are the subject
of a change in zoning classification or district boundary, the consideration of such uses by the
Planning Commission in conjunction with a zoning application may also constitute the project
review of such proposed use if concurrently processed under procedures required by K.S.A. 12-
748, as amended.
1103 ANNUAL REVIEW.
At least once each year, the Planning Commission shall review or reconsider the Plan or any
part thereof and may propose amendments, extensions or additions to the same. The procedure
for the adoption of any such amendment, extension or addition to any Plan or part thereof shall
be the same as that required for the adoption of the original Plan or part thereof.
1104 JUDICIAL REVIEW.
Judicial Review of the Citys decision shall be pursuant to K.S.A. 12-760, as amended.

ARTICLE 12. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE
1200 SEVERABILITY
If any provisions of these regulations are held to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be considered separately and apart
from the remaining provisions of these regulations so as to be completely severable and the
remaining provisions of these regulations shall remain in full force and effect.
1201 SAVINGS CLAUSE
Neither the adoption of these regulations nor the repeal or amendment of any regulations,
ordinance or part or portion thereof or part of portion of these regulations shall in any manner
affect the enforcement of ordinances or regulations, which violations were committed prior to the
effective date hereof, nor be construed as a waiver of any license, fee, or penalty at said
effective date due and unpaid under such ordinances or regulations, nor be construed as
affecting any of the provisions of such ordinances or regulations relating to the collection of any
such license, fee, or penalty or the penal provisions applicable to any violation thereof, and all
rights and obligations thereunder appertaining shall continue in full force and effect.
1202 EFFECTIVE DATE
These regulations shall be in full force and effect from and after their adoption by the Planning
Commission, approval by the Governing Body and adoption of an ordinance incorporating these
regulations by reference, and publication of such ordinance in the official city newspaper.
ZONING REGULATIONS APPENDIX A
A-212
APPENDIX A: TABLE OF COMPARABILITY OF ZONING DISTRICTS
In accordance with provisions provided in K.S.A. 12-757(b) the Derby City Planning
Commission hereby establishes a "Table of Comparability for Zoning Districts" as listed
below. This table designates the zoning districts, which are considered to be "lesser
changes" due to their more restrictive characteristics as set forth in the Zoning
Regulations.
When considering zoning district amendments, the Planning Commission and the
Governing Body may recommend and approve a lesser change in zoning districts for
the property already advertised for a public hearing without republication of a notice or
redistribution of notices to property owners. This is the case provided such change is
more restrictive than the district which is applied for as shown on the table below;
provided, however, that such recommendation and approval shall not be for a lesser
classification than the existing zoning district. If the applicant at the Governing Body
meeting, at which a zoning amendment is being considered desires to amend the
application and/or the Governing Body desires to consider a 'lesser' zoning change,
then such a proposed change shall be returned to the Planning Commission for
reconsideration and further recommendation to the Governing Body without further
publication or notice as provided for in K.S.A. 12-757(c) and in Section 1104 of the
Zoning Regulations.
MOST RESTRICTIVE
R-1 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
R-2 TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
R-3 MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
R-4 MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
I-1 INSTITUTIONAL DISTRICT
B-1 OFFICE BUSINESS DISTRICT
B-2 NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS DISTRICT
B-3 GENERAL BUSINESS DISTRICT
B-4 CENTRAL SHOPPING DISTRICT
B-5 RESTRICTED COMMERCIAL, WAREHOUSING AND LIMITED
MANUFACTURING DISTRICT
LEAST RESTRICTIVE
M-1 INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
NOTE: Because of the uniqueness and special purpose for which the "R-1A" Single-
Family Zero Lot Line Residential District, R-1B Low-Density Residential District,
R-1C Suburban Single-Family Residential District, "MH-1" Manufactured/Mobile
ZONING REGULATIONS APPENDIX A
A-213
Home Park District, B-2A Buckner Business District, "PUD" Planned Unit Development
District and "F-P" Flood Plain District serve, these districts are excluded from the Table
of Comparability.
Although the notification for a "Special Use" or a Conditional Use is processed in the
same manner as a rezoning case, it is not an actual change in zoning districts and,
therefore, the Table of Comparability does not apply and reapplication is necessary for
consideration of a different "Use" even if in the same zone. Part of the property
considered for a "Special Use or Conditional Use," however, may be withdrawn by the
applicant or a lesser amount recommended for approval without re-notification.
EXAMPLE: If an application is advertised for public hearing requesting a change from
"R-1" Single-Family Residential District to "M-1" Industrial District, the Planning
Commission may recommend the lesser, i.e., more restrictive "B-5", "B-4," "B-3," "B-2,"
"B-1," etc., districts without republication or mailing of new notices.
If an application, however, is advertised for a public hearing requesting a change from
the existing "B-1" Office Business District to the "M-1" Industrial District, the
recommending of the lesser "R-3" or "R-2" Districts shall not be valid without
republication and the mailing of new notices.

APPENDIX C: DESIGN CRITERIA
From time to time the Planning Commission may adopt design criteria in the form of policy
statements to assist in reviewing site plans.
The following such policy statements as adopted by the City of Derby on June 7, 2007 shall, as
specified below, be employed in the development of all non-residential (but not to include
industrial or manufacturing uses located in the M-1 zoning district) uses in the City of Derby.
As part of the Site Plan review process, building elevations, site layout plans, material lists or
descriptions, and other documentation shall be included with the site plan submittal which
provides sufficient detail by which the Planning Commission can determine that the intent of
these requirements is being satisfied.
While it is not the intent of the City to restrict design freedom unduly when reviewing project
architecture in connection with a site and building plan, it is in the best interest of the City to
promote high standards of architecture design and compatibility with surrounding structures and
neighborhoods. In that regard, the following policy statements and design criteria shall be used
as guidelines in the preparation of required site and building plans.
1. APPLICABILITY:
These requirements shall apply to all new commercial, office and institutional use and if
located in other than the M-1 industrial district any such allowed manufacturing form of
use. These requirements shall also apply to any major renovation, restoration, modification,
addition or retrofit of a structure or site that exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the current
appraised value of any structure or site as established by Sedgwick County. Such costs
shall be aggregated over a five-year period to determine if such development is subject to
these requirements. Such costs shall not, however, include routine maintenance and repair
of a structure of other feature on the surrounding site, such as roof replacement or general
repairs to a parking area or other site feature. In no case are redevelopments within the M-
1 Industrial District to be made subject to these requirements.
2. POLICY STATEMENT/PRINCIPALS:
To implement and define criteria for the purpose set forth in this Chapter, the following
principals are established:
a) No building shall be permitted; the design or exterior appearance of which is of
unorthodox or abnormal character in relation to its surroundings as to be unsightly or
offensive to generally accepted taste and community standards.
b) No building shall be permitted, the design or exterior appearance of which is so
identical with those adjoin as to create excessive monotony or drabness.
c) No building shall be permitted where any exposed façade is constructed or faced
with a finished material which is aesthetically incompatible with the other facades
and which presents an unattractive appearance to the public and to surrounding
properties.
ZONING REGULATIONS APPENDIX C
A-219
d) No building or sign shall be permitted to be sited on the property in a manner which
would unnecessarily destroy or substantially damage the natural beauty of the area,
particularly insofar as it would adversely affect values incident to ownership of land in
that area, or which would unnecessarily have an adverse effect on the aesthetics
and general enjoyment of existing structures on adjoining properties.
e) Accessory structures shall be of a similar architectural design and material as the
primary building on the property.
f) In addition to design issues involving buildings, accessory structures, signage and
other such structural features, site plans should also incorporate in the design,
features that address criteria involving pedestrian access and circulation, parking lot
layout, open space and amenities and the preservation of natural features such as
vegetation, topography, streams and other natural drainage ways. Attention to
criteria such as above shall especially be provided for developments involving large
tracts (5 or more acres), multiple buildings/uses and/or originally platted under a
unified ownership.
3. DESIGN CRITERIA FOR BUILDINGS AND RELATED STRUCTURES:
a) All buildings shall be finished on all sides with permanent finished materials or
consistent quality. Major exterior surfaces of all primary structures shall be face
brick, architectural concrete, glass, stucco, synthetic stucco, decorative block, or
stone. Pre-cast panels and concrete block may be acceptable if incorporated in a
building design that is compatible with other development throughout the district.
The determination if pre-cast panels and concrete block are acceptable is in the sole
discretion of the Planning Commission. A wall surface may use wood, vinyl, or
metal, as accent material, provided they are appropriately integrated into the overall
building design (see item 1 below).
b) All rooftop or ground mounted mechanical equipment, satellite dish antennas, and
exterior trash storage areas shall be screened with materials compatible with the
principal structure.
c) Underground utilities shall be provided for all new and substantially renovated
structures.
d) Accessory structures, either attached or detached from the primary structure, shall
be constructed of identical materials, style, quality, and appearance as the principal
structure.
e) Design building entrances as prominent and easily identifiable. Create transition
between the exterior and interior. Provide building entries with adequate lighting.
For restaurants or other uses with drive-thru facilities, entrances and exits shall be
designed, located or otherwise positioned so as to eliminate or at least minimize
possible safety conflicts between persons using such entrances (exits) and vehicular
traffic. Exits (entrances) for example shall not be located or positioned in such a
manner that patrons could walk directly into a drive-thru lane or other parking lot
aisle or such that a patron or driver of a vehicle had an obstructed or insufficient view
so as to impair the patrons ability to safely enter or exit the facility. (See also 5 i).
ZONING REGULATIONS APPENDIX C
A-220
f) Elements of architecture including window and door placement to be designed to add
variety and interest to the project.
g) Design all buildings in group commercial, office, and industrial/manufacturing uses
(located outside of the M-1 district) developments, including service station,
convenience stores, chain restaurants, car dealerships, and auto maintenance
facilities, in a complementary architectural style, and incorporate similar materials
and colors throughout the development. This requirement or criteria is not, however,
intended to preclude the use of unique designs, mixed forms of development or other
development concepts that while a-typical to these criteria can still be demonstrated
to achieve the intent of these requirements.
h) Architecturally integrate canopies for gas station, car washes, or similar uses with the
building they serve in terms of material, color, texture, roof style and proportional
relationship.
i) Incorporate elements into the design of large structures which provide a transition to
the human scale, particularly at the ground. Such elements may be provided
through, but not limited to, covered walkways, building arcades and trellises.
j) Provide architectural interest and style by varying horizontal and vertical elements of
exterior walls in height and projection. Such interest and style may be provided
through, but not limited to, the imaginative treatment of windows, doors, eaves, roof
lines, parapets, wainscots, columns, and beams.
k) Incorporate building trim, accents, color, materials and style into primary design
themes to promote architectural visual interest.
l) The design of the project shall be expressed on all exterior elevations of the building.
The Planning Commission may waive this requirement if in their opinion the project
backs up to a similar project, such as where there is an alley between or other
condition to the rear of the project would reasonably preclude the need for a building
elevation to be to adhere to this requirement.
m) Design details of all building elevations to continue the character or theme of the
project.
n) Screen non-building elements such as but not limited to, vending machines, and ice
lockers from street and parking lot view.
o) Design patio enclosures visible from the street similar to the architectural character
of the project.
p) Integrate design and placement of building entry and exposed stairs with the design
of the project through the use of similar building material, detail, shapes and colors.
q) Use roofline variations to provide architectural style or character for buildings that are
limited in wall configuration due to functional constraints.
r) Design vertical scale of a project to be proportional to adjacent land uses.
ZONING REGULATIONS APPENDIX C
A-221
4. DESIGN CRITERIA FOR SIGNS:
a) The use of monument, tenant directory or ground signs is encouraged with pole or
free standing signs being intended only in those situations where such a sign can,
due to site condition, traffic concerns or other acceptable situation, be determined to
be a more acceptable sign than the above noted types. The request for a pole, pylon
or freestanding sign is subject to approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals as a
condition use sign.
b) Provide monument, tenant directory or ground sign structures with a base of metal,
concrete, or masonry construction. Use sign cabinets and sign faces mounted atop
a base bordered by the architectural features, materials, and embellishment of the
entire sign.
c) Use exterior materials, finishes, and colors in harmony with, or an upgrade to, those
of the buildings or structures on site.
d) Reflect distinctive elements of the general architectural style or design theme of the
development in the sign structure.
e) Use embellishment to incorporate the primary design elements or unique
architectural features of the buildings or structures.
5. DESIGN CRITERIA FOR OTHER SITE PLAN ELEMENTS:
a) Respect the existing topography and landscaping: Maintain the unique and
identifiable topography and/or landscaping of a site. Respond to the unique terrain
by blending with the natural shapes and texture of the land while minimizing
disturbance to the natural environment.
b) Art in Private Development: Encourage the creation of more attractive, unique and
aesthetically pleasing public spaces. Artwork may be integrated into public and
private development projects where appropriate.
c) Trash and Refuse Collection Areas: Areas which generate noise and odors are to be
located where they will not disturb the occupants within the project or adjacent uses.
1) Minimum requirements for screening of trash and refuse areas are specified
in Section 304.
d) Outside Storage: Outside storage areas are to be screened from street view and
adjacent residential, office and commercial districts as specified in Section 304.
e) Outdoor lighting: Lighting is to provide security and visual interest. Lighting is to be
placed and shielded to limit glare and to limit the emission of light beyond the
development.
f) Noise Impact: Include in site design provisions for limiting noise from one
development interfering with the use of adjacent properties. The occupants of a
development are to be protected from noise from both outside and within the site
ZONING REGULATIONS APPENDIX C
A-222
through screening, setbacks and building materials. Locate noise generating
equipment to minimize impact on adjacent residential and pedestrian uses.
g) Pedestrian Circulation/Waiting: Provide a network of convenient and safe pedestrian
paths to connect areas within the project to adjacent properties and public right-ofway.
Provide directness, continuity, street crossings, visual interest, shade, site
furnishings, and safely for pedestrians within and entering the project. Provide a
pedestrian pathway network linking the project together and provide a continuous
pathway to surrounding developments with at least one (1) pedestrian walkway
connection to adjacent streets.
h) In addition to required landscaping, consider landscaping to compliment the
architecture, to minimize the impact of incompatible land uses, and to establish a
transition between adjacent developments. Plant materials can absorb sound, filter
air, curtail erosion, provide shade and maintain privacy.
1) Provide landscaping to break up bland walls, shade pedestrians, accent
entries and soften the connection of paving for vehicles to buildings.
2) Design retention / detention basins as an integral part of the landscape
theme. Basins shall not appear to be a ditch or pit. Such landscaping should
help soften the visual appearance of the basin and integrate it into the
landscape for the overall area.
3) Provide a variety of tree species at the interior and perimeter of projects.
4) Landscaping variety, innovative design, transition between plant material and
ground cover, dispersal and grouping of plant material, and other recognized
landscape architecture practices is encourage.
5) Developments should provide additional buffering to address compatibly
issues.
6) Design foundation base to incorporate such elements as seat walls,
decorative pavement, water features and decorative bollards. Where
landscaping is included, design planters to accommodate mature height and
width of landscaping.
7) Design for public access to adjacent streets, bus loading areas, and
pedestrian areas as required by ADA.
i) In addition to the action noted in 3 e. above, concerning the provision of safe
entrances and exits, certain design features may, or should also be employed that
aid that goal. The use of railing, other such barriers, landscaping, the alignment of
sidewalk, etc. should be used to prevent direct access into a traffic lane. Traffic
lanes and drive-thru lanes should be designed so as to direct vehicles away from
exits / entrances. Signage, ground graphics, defined pedestrian crosswalks, etc.
shall also be used to clearly identify paths connecting parking areas and facility exits
and entrances.

roadways shall be graded and improved and water, sewer and
other utility connections or other physical improvements installed;
D. To provide for and secure to the proper governing body the actual
construction of such physical improvements;
E. To avoid water and air pollution, flooding conditions and the
congestion of population and traffic;
F. To facilitate fire and police protection;
G. To conserve energy, water and soil resources;
SUBDIVISION REGULATION Article 1
1-2
H. To coordinate the subdividing of land with applicable zoning
regulations, various construction codes and other City and County
regulations which also affect the development of the land;
I. To establish administrative procedures to assure a fair and uniform
basis for a working relationship with subdividers, utility companies
and other governmental agencies, and
J. To realize the goals, policies and proposals as contained in the
adopted Comprehensive Development Plan for the Derby Area.

SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 4
4-2
401 ACTION BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON A SKETCH PLAT.
Unless not required as provided for in Section 400, the subdivider of property
shall first file a Sketch Plat for review and approval by the Planning Commission.
Once an application for Sketch Plat review has been filed, along with the required
number of Sketch Plat drawings and any required filing fee, the Department of
Community Development shall schedule the Sketch Plat for consideration at the
next available meeting of the Planning Commission. The Sketch Plat shall
contain the data and information set out in Section 400 and Section 500 of these
Regulations.
402 FAILURE TO AGREE ON A SKETCH PLAT.
If the subdivider and the Planning Commission are unable to reach an agreement
on the characteristics of the Sketch Plat, then the subdivider may appeal,
pursuant to Section 1100 of this Regulation, to the Governing Body for a
determination with respect to the characteristics of the Sketch Plat on which the
subdivider and the Planning Commission have been unable to agree. Such
appeal shall be made in writing and filed with the City Manager within 60 days
after the date the Planning Commission and subdivider were unable to reach
agreement on the Sketch Plat. In the event of an appeal, the subdivider shall
submit such number of copies of the Sketch Plat, as is determined necessary by
the Department of Community Development, for distribution to the Governing
Body and affected City and County Departments and public utility companies.
403 SIGNIFICANCE OF SKETCH PLAT APPROVAL.
After the subdivider has received approval of a Sketch Plat from the Planning
Commission or, upon appeal, has received Sketch Plat approval from the
Governing Body, then the subdivider may proceed with the preparation of a
Preliminary Plat. Approval of a Sketch Plat shall be effective for no more than
one year from the date approval was granted. If a Preliminary Plat has not been
submitted for Planning Commission review within the one year period, the
Department of Community Development shall close the Sketch Plat file.
404 FILING OF A PRELIMINARY PLAT.
Applications for Preliminary Plats shall be filed with the Department of
Community Development a minimum of 20 days prior to the Planning
Commission meeting established for review of the Preliminary Plat. The
preliminary plat application shall be accompanied by such number of copies of
the Preliminary Plat as may be determined necessary by the Department of
Community Development for proper review by affected and interested
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 4
4-3
governmental, public and private organizations. The preliminary plat application
shall be filed within one year of the date that approval of the Sketch Plat was
obtained. The Preliminary Plat shall contain the information as set out in Section
501 of these Regulations. Such plats shall not be accepted for filing until a filing
fee has been paid by the subdivider.
405 DISTRIBUTION AND REVIEW OF A PRELIMINARY PLAT.
After the filing of the preliminary plat application, the Department of Community
Development shall distribute copies of the Preliminary Plat to affected and
interested governmental, public and private organizations as deemed appropriate
by the Department of Community Development. Organizations receiving copies
shall have 10 days to review the Preliminary Plat and to make their
recommendations to the Planning Commission. A lack of response within ten 10
days from the date of mailing shall, at the discretion of the Planning Commission,
signify approval, unless during this period a written request for more review time
is submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission. Only one extension
of review time may be granted by the Planning Commission for a period not to
exceed 14 days. The Department of Community Development shall prepare a
written report outlining any pertinent information concerning the Preliminary Plat
including recommendations, and shall submit the written report to the Planning
Commission, the applicant and the applicant's agent.
406 ACTION BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON A PRELIMINARY PLAT.
The Planning Commission shall review the Preliminary Plat and may conduct a
public hearing, if deemed desirable, at which time interested parties may attend
and offer evidence in support of or against the Preliminary Plat.
A. The Planning Commission shall determine whether the Preliminary Plat
meets the design standards and requirements of these Regulations, the
applicable Comprehensive Plan, the applicable zoning regulations and
other applicable provisions of the regulations of the City.
B. If the foregoing considerations are satisfied, the Planning Commission
shall approve the Preliminary Plat.
C. If the Planning Commission determines that the Preliminary Plat does not
satisfy the foregoing conditions, it may require changes to satisfy the
conditions and in such event:
1. The subdivider may amend the Preliminary Plat so as to
incorporate the changes needed and resubmit the plat to the
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 4
4-4
Planning Commission, which shall then grant its approval if the
amendments satisfy the changes needed.
2. The subdivider may reject the changes required by the Planning
Commission and appeal the matter to the Governing Body under
Section 1100 of this Regulation. Such appeal shall be made in
writing and filed with the City Manager within 60 days after the date
the Planning Commission outlined required changes which the
subdivider does not wish to comply with.
D. If the Planning Commission determines that a Preliminary Plat does not
satisfy the conditions of these Regulations and that required changes
would be too extensive or impractical, it shall not approve the Preliminary
Plat and, as soon as possible, the subdivider, shall be provided a copy of
the minutes of the meeting, at which the decision to not approve was
made.
E. In any event, the Planning Commission shall approve or not approve the
Preliminary Plat within 60 days from the date of filing the preliminary plat
application, unless such time is extended by mutual consent.
F. The subdivider may appeal the decision not to approve their Preliminary
Plat to the Governing Body under Section 1100 of this Regulation. Such
appeal shall be made in writing and filed with the City Manager within 60

approve the Preliminary Plat.
407 FAILURE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO ACT ON A PRELIMINARY
PLAT.
If the Planning Commission fails to approve or not approve a Preliminary Plat
within 60 days after the date the plat is submitted for Planning Commission
review then the Preliminary Plat shall be deemed to have been approved, unless
the subdivider has consented to extend or waive the 60 day time limit.
408 SIGNIFICANCE OF PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL.
Preliminary Plat approval by the Planning Commission or, in cases involving an
appeal, approval by the Governing Body shall signify only the following:
A. Approval signifies in general the acceptability of the proposed subdivision
for which a Final Plat must subsequently be approved.
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 4
4-5
B. Such approval shall be effective for no more than 12 months from the date
approval was granted, unless, upon written request from the subdivider,
the Planning Commission grants an extension of time beyond such period.
If a Final Plat for the entire subdivision or a portion thereof has not been
filed with the Planning Commission within such period, or no extensions of
time to plat have been granted by the Planning Commission, the
Preliminary Plat must be resubmitted to the Planning Commission as if
such plat had never been approved. If a Final Plat is not filed within one
year, and a request for an extension of platting time has not been granted
by the Planning Commission, the Department of Community Development
shall close the Preliminary Plat file.
409 FILING OF A FINAL PLAT.
Applications for Final Plat approval shall be filed with the Department of
Community Development a minimum of 20 days prior to the Planning
Commission meeting established for review of the Final Plat. The final plat

Development shall distribute copies of the Final Plat to affected and interested
governmental, public and private organizations as deemed appropriate by the
Department of Community Development. Organizations receiving copies shall
have 10 days to review the Final Plat and to make their recommendations to the
Planning Commission. A lack of response within 10 days from the date of
mailing shall, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, signify approval,
unless during this period a written request for more review time is submitted to
and approved by the Planning Commission. Only one extension of review time
may be granted by the Planning Commission for a period not to exceed 14 days.
The Department of Community Development shall prepare a written report
outlining any pertinent information concerning the Final Plat including
recommendations, and shall submit the written report to the Planning
Commission, the applicant and the applicant's agent.
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 4
4-6
411 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION ON A FINAL PLAT.
The Planning Commission shall review the Final Plat and may conduct a public
hearing, if deemed desirable, at which time interested parties may attend and
offer evidence in support of or against the Final Plat.
A. The Planning Commission shall determine if the Final Plat is substantially
the same as the approved Preliminary Plat;
B. There has been compliance with all conditions which may have been
attached to the approval of the Preliminary Plat; and

Plat. If a Final Plat is not approved, as soon as possible, the subdivider
shall be provided a copy of the minutes of the meeting at which the
decision to not approve the plat was made. If the Final Plat is not
approved, the subdivider may:
1. Amend the Final Plat so as to incorporate the changes needed and
resubmit the plat to the Planning Commission, which shall then
grant approval if the amendments satisfy the changes needed; or
2. Reject the changes required by the Planning Commission and
appeal the Final Plat to the Governing Body under Section 1100 of
this Regulation. Such appeal shall be made in writing and filed with
the City Manager within 60 days after the date the Planning
Commission outlined changes or requirements that the subdivider
does not wish to comply with.
412 FAILURE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO ACT ON A FINAL PLAT.
If the Planning Commission fails to approve or not approve a Final Plat within the
60 days after the date the plat is submitted, then the Final Plat shall be deemed
to have been approved, unless the subdivider has consented to extend or waive
the 60 day time limit.
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 4
4-7
413 GOVERNING BODY ACTION ON A FINAL PLAT.
Following the Planning Commissions approval of a Final Plat it shall be
submitted to the Governing Body for review and approval and acceptance of
dedications for streets and other public ways, access controls, public utility
easements and any land being dedicated or established for public uses.

601 COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Subdivisions shall conform with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan.
602 STREETS
A. General. The location, width and grade of streets shall be considered in
their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical condition,
public convenience and safety, and the proposed use of the land to be
served by the streets. The street system shall assure an adequate traffic
circulation system with intersection angles, grades, tangents and curves
appropriate for the traffic to be carried considering the terrain. Where
location is not shown in any Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of
streets in a subdivision shall either:
1. Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
principal streets in surrounding areas; or
2. Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Planning Commission to meet a particular situation where
topographical or other conditions make continuance or
conformance to existing streets impractical.
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 6
Revised 03/11

Arterial right-of-way widths shall not be less than 120 feet, except that 150
feet of right-of-way shall be required within 250 feet from the intersection
of the centerlines of an arterial street with any other arterial or collector
street and taper to 120 feet at a distance of 350 feet from the intersection
centerline. All section line roads are considered to be arterial streets.
C. Access Control. No individual lot access shall be permitted to arterial
streets, except in proposed commercial or industrial areas. Individual lot
access may be permitted at the discretion of the Planning Commission as
a variance under Section 11-1103.
Direct access to commercial and industrial lots shall be a minimum of:
200 from any intersection to the first right in/out driveway
400 from any intersection to the first full turning movement
driveway
Such distances shall be measured from the nearest point where the street
rights-of-way intersect. Any reduction in these requirements shall be
approved by the City Engineer. All access driveways, whether placed in
accordance with standard requirements or as a deviation from such
standards, shall require the approval of the City Engineer.
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 6
Revised 03/11
6 - 3
The location and number of street access points to residential subdivisions
shall be approved by the City Engineer and the Fire Chief.
D. Reserve Strips. Reserve strips or street plugs controlling the access to
streets will not be approved unless necessary for the protection of the
public welfare or of substantial property rights and in these cases they
may be required. The control and disposal of the land composing such
strips shall be placed within the jurisdiction of the City under conditions
approved by the Planning Commission.
E. Alignment. All streets other than minor streets or cul-de-sacs, as far as
practical, shall be in alignment with existing streets by continuations of the
center lines thereof.
Collector streets if they curve, shall have a minimum centerline curve
radius of at least 350 feet. This is based on a design speed of 30 MPH.
The curve radius may be modified to meet special conditions for other
design speeds.
Streets shall be laid out so as to provide for horizontal sight distances on
all curves. These distances shall be:
Local Streets 200 feet
Collector Streets 300 feet
Arterial Streets 500 feet
F. Future Extension of Streets. Where necessary to give access to or
permit a satisfactory future subdivision of adjoining land, streets shall be
extended to the boundary of the subdivision and the resulting dead-end
streets may be approved without a turn-around. Reserve strips and street
plugs may be required to preserve the objectives of street extensions.
G. Intersection Angles. Streets shall be laid out to intersect at an angle as
near to a right angle as practical.
H. Existing Streets. Whenever existing streets adjacent to or within a tract
are of inadequate width, additional right-of-way shall be provided at the
time of subdivision.
I. Half Streets. Half streets are not acceptable and shall not be approved
except whenever an existing half street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
Reserve strips and street plugs may be required to preserve the objectives
of half streets.
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 6
Revised 03/11

J. Cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac shall be as short as possible and shall have a
maximum length of 600 feet measured along the center line beginning at
the point of intersection of the access street and terminating at the
beginning of the turn-around and serve not more than 25 single-family
dwellings. All cul-de-sacs shall terminate with a circular turn-around with a
minimum radius of 55 feet for a local residential access street and 75 feet
for a local non-residential street for the right-of-way in the City and a 75
foot radius outside the City. In the design of cul-de-sacs, the center of the
circle on entering shall be either on or offset to the left of the extended
center line of the street. Although not to be encouraged, other types of
turnarounds may be permitted by the Planning Commission due to limited
space availability and topographic considerations.
K. Street Names. No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be
confused with names of existing streets. Street names and numbers shall
conform to the established pattern in the City and shall be subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission.
L. Private Streets. If approved by the Planning Commission, the following
conditions shall apply for the use of private streets:
1. The private street shall be depicted as a Reserve on a plat
and stated as such in the plats text.
2. At a minimum, the width of the Reserve(s) shall equal the
width of right-of-way required for the type of street that would
be required for a public street, including any areas for a culde-
sac. Building setbacks shall also be platted that
correspond to those that would be required for lots adjacent
to a public street.
3. Such streets shall be constructed to the same standards as a public
street, that is, the same required width of the paved surface, use of
curb and gutters, required street pavement depths and the
installation of sidewalks.
4. A covenant shall be submitted for recording which establishes that
the benefiting property owner(s) will be responsible for all
maintenance, repairs and any other incidental actions (signage,
etc.) involving the private streets operations. This covenant shall,
however, provide for the public entity to maintain or repair the street
should the private entity fail to do so and bill incurred costs to the
benefiting property(s).
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 6
Revised 03/11
6 - 5
5. At the time of platting, such streets shall be guaranteed by an
irrevocable fiscal guarantee (other than by public petitions),
assuring their timely construction.
M. Roundabouts or Traffic Circles. Given the unique nature of these traffic
features, whether proposed during a sites platting or as an improvement
subsequent to a development, detail design and construction plans shall
be submitted to the City Engineer for his review and approval. If being
proposed during the platting of a site, such plans shall be provided along
with the submittal of the plat.
603 BLOCKS
A. General. The length, width and shape of blocks shall be designed with
due regard to providing adequate building sites for the use contemplated,
consideration of needs for convenient access, circulation, control and
safety of street traffic, and recognition of limitations and opportunities of
topography.
B. Sizes. Blocks shall not be limited in length except that in order to
preserve the character and safety of an area, block length may be subject
to limitations as approved by the Planning Commission.
C. Easements.
1. Utility easements shall be provided where necessary and centered
on rear or side lot lines and shall be at least 20 feet wide along rear
lot lines and 10 feet wide along side lot lines; except that
easements for street lighting, telephone or cable television
purposes shall not in any event be required to exceed 10 feet. Side
lot easements, when needed for other than street lighting purposes,
may exceed 10 feet. Utility and drainage easements may be
combined; however, no blanket easements for utilities shall be
permitted.
2. Drainage Easements. Drainage Easements shall be provided
where necessary to accommodate storm water sewers and minor
drainage swales. Widths and locations shall be as determined in
the Drainage Plan submitted with the Final Plat. Utility and
drainage easements may be combined, with a minimum width of
20'.
An easement of at least 30 feet may be required if such easement
is planned to include utilities, sanitary sewer and drainage
improvements. Easements 30 feet and wider may also be required
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 6
Revised 03/11
6 - 6
when considered necessary to protect rows of trees or other natural
features lying within the expected area of the easement.
3. Pedestrian and Access Ways. When desirable for public
convenience, pedestrian ways may be required to connect to culde-
sacs or pass through unusually long or oddly shaped blocks.
Such pedestrian or access ways shall also be provided whenever
such a facility is necessary to, provide a convenient and direct route
to other existing or planned pedestrian ways, including hike & bike
paths, to public features such a schools and parks, to connect open
space areas such as Reserves in adjacent developments, for
pedestrian access to and from large commercial developments,
between adjacent cul-de-sacs, at the end of a cul-de-sac that would
allow access to a public sidewalk or other public facility and other
such situations as the Planning Commission determines would
encourage pedestrian and bicycle friendly access.
As necessary, such pedestrian and access ways shall be paved to
a width of 10 feet and shall be located in an easement or Reserve
of at least 20 feet in width unless the Planning Commission
determines a lesser or greater width is necessary.
4. Vision triangle easements shall be required on all corner lots to
provide an open and usable vision path for drivers of vehicles
approaching the intersection. The extent of vision triangle
easements shall be based on the type of intersection (3-way, four,
protected, unprotected, etc.), the type of street (local, collector,
arterial, commercial or industrial), topography, proposed street
grades (if any), and the design speeds contemplated for such
roadways.
5. Planting easement. An easement of 20 feet or less may be
required which provides for the permanent planting and
maintenance of a landscaped and/or fenced area to meet the
screening requirement of the Zoning Regulations.
604 LOTS
A. Size and Shape. Lot size, width, shape and orientation shall be
appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of
development and use contemplated. Minimum lot standards shall conform
to the City Zoning Regulations or, in an area outside of the City, to the
County Zoning Regulations. These minimum standards shall apply with
the following exceptions:
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 6
Revised 03/11
6 - 7
1. In areas that will not be served by a public sewer, minimum lot
sizes shall conform to the requirements of the Wichita-Sedgwick
County Department of Community Health and shall take into
consideration problems of water supply and sewage disposal,
particularly problems of soil structure and water table as related to
sewage disposal by septic tank. *
2. In those areas where there may be municipal-type water and/or
sanitary sewer facilities anticipated in the foreseeable future, but
which are not yet available, lots may be required to be designed
and arranged so that they may readily be converted to urban type
building sites without replatting. When such a condition prevails,
land should be subdivided into lots so that by combining lots, a
building site is created initially with an area of not less than that
required for on-lot wells and/or sewage treatment systems. The
creation of such a building site through use of multiple groups of
lots shall be contingent upon the establishment for record of
restrictive covenants satisfactory to the legal counsel of the
Planning Agency, providing that no more than one dwelling unit
shall be built on such an aggregate group of lots until such time as
municipal-type water and/or sewer service is available.
3. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial
and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for off-street
driveway and parking facilities required by the type of use and
development contemplated.
____________
* NOTE: All public sanitary sewer and sewage treatment systems are further subject to
the regulations of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment
B. Access. Each lot shall abut upon a street other than an alley for a width of
at least 35 feet.
For non-residential uses, the Planning Commission may allow the use of
access easements for a lot without frontage to a street. Such access
easement(s) shall only be allowed when the Planning Commission
determines there is a unique physical situation of a site that makes direct
access to a street unreasonable or the nature of a development is such
that the use of access easements would serve the same function and
purpose as would access by a street. Any such access easement shall be
shown on a plat of the site, with a minimum width of 35 feet and with the
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 6
Revised 03/11
6 - 8
plattors text indicating the parties responsible for the maintenance of the
easement, that the easement will not be encumbered in any way,
including that the easement will be signed for no parking. A covenant
shall also be submitted with the plat, for recording, that addresses the
above noted issues.
C. Lot Side Lines. The side lines of lots, as far as practicable, shall run at
right angles to the street upon which the lots face.
D. Double Frontage. There shall be no double frontage lots for individual
dwellings (e.g., single-and-two family units), except where the lots abut
upon a limited access highway or arterial street or where the topography
of the land prevents reasonable subdivision in small units. Double
frontage lots shall not have vehicular access between such lots and an
abutting limited access highway or arterial street.
E. Reversed Frontage. Reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except
where such are essential to provide a separation of residential
development from limited access highways or arterial streets or to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
F. Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width when
necessary to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to
both streets.
605 BUILDING LINES
All front building setback lines are to be shown on the plat.
606 LAND SUBJECT TO FLOODING
Land subdivided outside the City is subject to the flood plain regulations of the
County.
Land within the City is subject to the following provisions:
A. All subdivision of land shall meet all the requirements of the flood plain
district as contained within the City Zoning Regulations. Such flood plain
regulations must have been approved by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency under the National Flood Insurance Program and
the Kansas Board of Agriculture under K.S.A. 12-741 et seq.
B. All subdivisions as described in Section 6-606(A) above must: (Also, see
Section 5-502(O) and Section 415 of the Zoning Regulations).
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 6
Revised 03/11

1. Show on the preliminary plat and drainage plan the boundary lines
for both the floodway, the flood fringe, and the base flood elevation.
2. Assure that (a) all such subdivisions are consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage, (b) all public utilities and facilities, such as
sewer, water, gas and electrical systems are located, elevated and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (c)
adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards.
3. On the final plat indicate minimum pad of all lots.
C. Watercourses. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse such
as a drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a drainage
reserve conforming substantially with the lines of the watercourse and
such further width as will be adequate for the purpose. Streets or
parkways parallel to major watercourses may be required. Watercourses
will be concreted or vegetated with adapted perennial grasses or
otherwise stabilized to prevent soil erosion and sediment movement by
wind or water. Drainage reserves shall be the responsibility of the
individual lot owner or subdivider homeowners association until such time
as the applicable Governing Body exercising jurisdiction elects to assume
the responsibility for maintenance and improvement of the drainage within
said floodway or reserve provided further, that no building shall be
constructed on or within said reserve nor shall any fill, change of grade,
creation of channel or other work be carried on without the permission of
the applicable Governing Body exercising jurisdiction and applicable state
agencies. The plat shall clearly indicate ownership and maintenance
responsibilities.
607 LAND SUBJECT TO EXCESSIVE EROSION BY WIND OR WATER.
On land subject to excessive soil movement by the forces of wind and/or water
and that may cause environmental health hazards, necessary preventive
measures shall be a part of the subdivision plat. Conservation standards
adopted by the County Conservation District shall be adhered to.
608 LAND FOR OPEN SPACE AND PUBLIC FACILITY SITES
Public agencies may use the following procedure for acquiring sites for open
space and public facilities which does not preclude voluntary dedication and
mutual negotiations for land or the use of the condemnation laws of the State.
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 6
Revised 03/11
6 - 10
A. That the subdivider offer to sell to the appropriate public body, agency or
authority lands, sites, and locations for parks, playgrounds, open space,
schools or other public facilities not exceeding 10% of the gross land area
of the subdivision. If such public body, agency or authority purchases any
such offered lands sites or locations prior to the date on which the
subdivider's plat of subdivision is recorded with the Register of Deeds, the
market price for such lands, sites or locations shall be computed as the
appropriate proportions of the fair market value of the entire subdivision
area as undivided land as of the date on which the subdivider submits his
preliminary plat for approval or, if no preliminary plat is required to be
submitted, as of the date on which the subdivider submits his final plat for
approval, plus that percentage of the costs of improvements required as a
part of the plat allocable to that portion being purchased.
B. That the subdivider reserve for sale to the appropriate public body, agency
or authority, lands, sites, and locations for parks, playgrounds, open
space, school or other public facilities not exceeding 10% of the gross
land area of the subdivision; provided, however, that a subdivider shall not
be required to reserve such lands, sites, and locations for a period longer
than (1) 18 months after the date of recording the subdivision plat with the
Register of Deeds, or (2) 60 days after actual construction shall have been
commenced on 35% of the residential units in the subdivision, whichever
shall result in a longer period of time. The market price for such lands,
sites, and locations shall be their fair market value as of the date that such
public body, agency or authority notifies the subdivider, in writing, of its
intention to purchase such lands, sites or locations or portions thereof,
plus that percentage of the costs of improvements required as a part of
the plat allocable to that portion being reserved, plus all taxes and
assessments which have been paid from the time such reservations of
lands was required until such lands are purchased.
609 LAND LOCATED WITHIN THE FLIGHT PATHS OF PUBLIC-OWNED
AIRPORTS.
Land located within established flight paths and noise impact areas of publicowned
airports shall be required to grant a permanent navigational easement to
the public. Such easement shall allow aircraft to operate within the "navigable
airspace" as defined by the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and shall waive, as to
the City only, any and all claims for damage of any kind whatsoever incurred as a
result of aircraft using the navigable airspace. Along with the navigational
easement, there shall be submitted and recorded a restrictive covenant which
states that any building constructed on the land covered by the navigational
easement shall be so designed and constructed as to minimize noise pollution,
giving due consideration to the use for which such structure is designed and built;
and that the land covered by such an navigational easement is exposed at times

to aircraft noise which may infringe upon a resident's enjoyment of property and
may, depending upon the degree of acoustical treatment of the dwelling, affect
his health and/or well being.
610 LAND IMPACTED BY McCONNELL AFB NOISE AND ACCIDENT POTENTIAL
ZONE.
Land use within the established accident potential zones and adverse noise
contour zones shall comply with the recommendations of the McConnell AFB
Kansas Air Installation Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) Study. Accident potential
zones allow land use that does not concentrate people in small areas. Theaters,
churches, schools, restaurants, shopping malls and other high density-of-people
functions are not considered compatible. Noise zone levels below 65 normally
provide unrestricted residential use and below 70 commercial/retail trade and
personal and business service. Land use above these noise levels require
careful evaluation prior to subdivision approval/disapproval.

municipal water mains, water meters and sanitary sewer laterals
which serve the lot being split.
902 APPROVAL GUIDELINES.
Approval or disapproval of lot splits shall be made based on the following
guidelines:
A. A lot split shall not be approved if any of the following conditions exist:
1. A new street or alley is needed or proposed;
2. A vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or
easements is required or proposed;
3. There is less street right-of-way than required by these Regulations
or Comprehensive Plan unless such dedication can be made by
separate instrument;
4. All easement requirements have not been satisfied;
5. Such split will result in a building site without direct access to an
opened street;

APPEALS, WAIVERS, VARIANCES AND EXCEPT
11 - 1
ARTICLE 11. APPEALS, WAIVERS, VARIANCES AND EXCEPTIONS
1100 APPEALS GENERAL
The subdivider of a proposed subdivision may appeal decisions made in the
enforcement of these regulations by the Planning Commission to the Governing
Body. In the event the Governing Body sustains the Planning Commission, the
action of the Planning Commission shall be final except as otherwise provided by
law. If the Governing Body overrules the Planning Commission, the Governing
Body shall make its decision, in writing or in the minutes of the meeting, stating
reason therefore and return such decision and plat to the Planning Commission
for consideration of approval as required by law.
1101 APPEALS OF IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS.
Any appeal as to approval of standards or plans and engineering drawings in
connection with required improvements shall be directed to the Governing Body
and that action shall be final.
1102 WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Any waiver of the required improvements may be made only by the Governing
Body on a showing that such improvements are not feasible or necessary.
1103 VARIANCES
In cases in which there is unwarranted hardship in carrying out the literal
provisions of these regulations as to design criteria, the Planning Commission
may grant a variance from such provision according to the following guidelines:
A. The Planning Commission shall not grant a variance unless it shall find
that:
1. The variance requested arises from such a condition(s) which is
unique to the subdivision in question and which is not ordinarily
found in other areas of the City and is not created by an action(s) of
the subdivider;
2. Approving the variance will not adversely affect the rights of
adjacent property owners;
3. The strict application of the provisions of these regulations of which
the variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon
the subdivider;
SUBDIVISION REGULATION ARTICLE 11
APPEALS, WAIVERS, VARIANCES AND EXCEPT
11 - 2
4. The variance desired will not adversely affect the public health,
safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare;
and
5. Approving the variance desired will not be opposed to the general
spirit and intent of these regulations.
B. Variances permitted under the provisions of this Article shall not include
variances from the requirements of making improvements or guaranteeing
their installation unless approved by the Governing Body as provided for in
Section 11-1102. Variances also may not be granted from the provisions
of any zoning regulations by these variance procedures. Consideration of
an application for a variance pursuant to this condition does not relieve
that applicant from the necessity of proceeding under the applicable
provisions of any other regulations including zoning regulations of the City
or the County relating to variances.
1104 EXCEPTIONS IN PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
When a subdivision plat is prepared in connection with a planned unit
development plan as authorized by any applicable zoning regulations which
regulate the same jurisdictional area, then the Planning Commission may vary
the design standards contained in these regulations to such extent as may be
necessary to permit the preparation of a planned unit development plan in
accordance with the standards, conditions and restrictions of such zoning
regulations. The intent of such exceptions is to permit the subdivider more
flexibility of design while protecting the convenience, health, welfare and safety of
the probable future residents of the subdivision as well as the character of the
surrounding property and the general welfare of the Planning Area.
