PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Torrington, Connecticut. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CH:1 CODE 1:1 CODE APPENDIX A202:1 DISPOSITION LIST DL:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Kelly Heaton-Moniz and Janet Cramer, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Joseph L. Quartiero, City Clerk, CMC, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 
SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
    In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

Within 60 days after the publication of any ordinance as provided in § C4-3 of this Charter, which ordinance may be subject to referendum as provided herein, a petition requesting that such ordinance be either repealed or submitted to a vote of the electors may be filed by any elector of the City with the City Clerk. Any such petition shall conform to the requirements of Section 7-9 of the General Statutes as amended, except as provided herein. Said petition shall contain the full text of the ordinance to be repealed or submitted to referendum and shall be signed in ink or indelible pencil by qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least 15% of the electors registered at the last regular municipal election. Said petition shall be accompanied by affidavits signed and sworn to by each circulator as provided in said Section 7-9. The City Clerk shall, within five days after receipt of the last page of said petition within the time provided herein, determine the petition and the affidavits to be sufficient in the manner prescribed in § C4-6 of this Charter, and, if they shall be sufficient, he or she shall certify said petition to the Board of Councilmen. Upon filing of such petition with the City Clerk, such ordinance shall be suspended if already in effect, or, if not in effect, the effective date of such ordinance shall be postponed, if necessary, to the certification by said Clerk that the petition is not sufficient or to the certification of the results of such referendum. If the Board of Councilmen fails to repeal such ordinance, the question of repeal thereof shall be submitted to the electors at a referendum called by the Board of Councilmen and held within the 30 days after the petition for referendum has been certified to the Board. A majority vote of the electors to repeal such ordinance shall not become effective unless a total of at least 20% of the electors entitled to vote on the question shall have voted.

§ 71-1. - Findings; intent. 
    The Board of Councilmen of the City of Torrington finds: 
A.  The operation of adult-oriented establishments requires special regulation and supervision by the city to protect, preserve and promote the health, safety and welfare of the patrons, clients or customers and employees of such establishments, as well as the health, safety and welfare of the city's citizens. Further, protecting order and morality, preserving the character and preventing the deterioration of the city's neighborhoods, avoiding blight, decreasing crime and juvenile delinquency, promoting retail trade, maintaining property values and ensuring sanitary and safe public places are desirable objectives of the community and its leaders. 
B.  Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United States indicate that: 
(1)  Large numbers of persons frequent such adult-oriented establishments, especially those which provide closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms for the private viewing of so called adult motion pictures and/or videotapes and/or live entertainment. 
(2)  Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used by patrons, clients or customers of such adult-oriented establishments for the purpose of engaging in specified sexual activities. 
(3)  Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such establishments in order to provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients or customers of such establishments within such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms. 
(4)  Door, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed or on the entrances and/or exits of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms are in use encourage patrons, clients or customers using such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms to engage in specified sexual activities therein with prostitutes and/or with other persons and/or by themselves, thereby promoting or encouraging prostitution and the commission of specified sexual activities which cause blood, semen, urine or other bodily secretion to be deposited on the floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may come into contact with such deposits. 
(5)  Booths, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms are in use often contain holes that have been cut or smashed out of the walls or other partitioning material. These holes permit the inhabitant of one booth to engage in specified sexual activities with the inhabitant of an adjoining booth, cubicle, studio or room. These so called "glory holes" promote and encourage specified sexual acts to occur between persons anonymously. Anonymous sexual contact poses a higher risk of spread of communicable diseases, including the Aids virus and Hepatitis B and other sexually transmitted diseases. Further, the existence of glory holes in booths, cubicles, studios and rooms in an adult-oriented establishment provides an increased risk that blood, semen, urine and other bodily secretions will be deposited on the floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may come into contact with such deposits. 
(6)  Specified sexual activities often occur at unregulated adult-oriented establishments which provide live adult entertainment, specified sexual activities, including sexual physical contact between employees and patrons, clients or customers of adult-oriented establishments, and specifically include lap dancing and/or manual or oral touching or fondling of specified anatomical areas, whether clothed or unclothed. Such casual, sexual physical contact between strangers may result in the transmission of communicable diseases which would be detrimental to the health of the patrons, clients or customers and employees of such adult-oriented establishments. 
(7)  The unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments is associated with an increase in the incidents of sex-related crimes and also has a disruptive effect on the surrounding neighborhood by causing excessive noise, parking problems, the presence of discarded sexually oriented material on residential lawns and the performance of sexual acts in public places. 
(8)  The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adult-oriented establishments tends to discourage prostitution, other sex-related crimes, anonymous high-risk sexual contact and/or high-risk unsanitary sexual activity, excessive noise and property devaluation, thereby decreasing the incidents of communicable diseases and sex-related crimes and thereby promoting and protecting the health, safety and welfare of the employees and the public who patronize such establishments and protecting the health, safety and property interests of the city and its citizens. 
C.  The continued unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments is and would be detrimental to the general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of Torrington. The Constitution and the laws of the State of Connecticut grant to the town powers, especially police power, to enact reasonable legislation and measures to regulate and supervise adult-oriented establishments in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
D.  It is not the intent of the Board of Councilmen in enacting this chapter to deny any person rights to speech protected by the United States and/or State Constitutions, nor is it the intent of the Board of Councilmen to impose any limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books and/or other materials. Further, by enacting this chapter, the Board of Councilmen does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States and/or State Constitution; nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit such materials.

    FALSE ALARM: The activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation or negligence of the user of an alarm system or of his employees or agents; any signal or oral communication transmitted to the Police Department requesting or requiring or resulting in a response on the part of the Police Department when, in fact, there has been no unauthorized intrusion or attempted unauthorized intrusion into a premises. Excluded from this definition are activations of alarm systems caused by power outages, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and similar conditions.

Editor's note- An ordinance adopted Feb. 19, 2013, effective March 24, 2013, added provisions that were not specifically amendatory. At the editor's discretion, said provisions were included as §§ 165-1-165-4. 

§ 165-1. - Purpose and intent. 
    Agriculture is a significant part of the City of Torrington's heritage and a vital part of the City's future. It is therefore the declared policy of the City of Torrington and legislative determination of the Torrington City Council to conserve and protect agricultural land and to encourage agricultural operations and the sale of local farm products within the City. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to promote and advance the City's policy and reduce the loss of local agricultural resources by limiting circumstances under which any such operation may be considered a nuisance. It is hereby further legislatively determined that whatever impact may be caused to others through normal agricultural practices, such impact is offset and ameliorated by the benefits of farming to the neighborhood, community, and society in general. Methods of farming that comport with generally accepted farming practices are also deemed to comport with community standards at large. This chapter is not to be construed as modifying or abridging state law relative to the abatement of nuisances, but is to be used in the interpretation and characterization of activities and in considering and implementing enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinances of the City of Torrington and other applicable Town regulations, consistent with the provisions of Connecticut General Statutes 19a-341. Additionally, the terms of this chapter may be used in determining whether the methods and practices that may come under review conform to community standards. 
(Ord. of 2-19-2013(2)) 
§ 165-2. - Declaration. 
    No present or future agricultural operations conducted or maintained in a manner consistent with accepted customs and standards of the agricultural industry, including, without limitation, those practices prevailing in Litchfield County, on a recognized farm which is engaged in the act of farming as defined in this chapter shall become or be considered, a nuisance solely because such activity resulted or results in any changed condition of the use of adjacent land. Agricultural operations may occur on holidays, weekends and weekdays by night or day provided such activities do not violate applicable health, safety, fire, life safety or building codes and regulations shall include, without limitation: 
(1)  The incidental noise from livestock or farm equipment used in normal, generally acceptable farming practices, including, without limitation, those practices prevailing in Litchfield County; 
(2)  Odors from livestock, manure, fertilizer or feed; 
(3)  Dust and fumes associated with normally accepted farming practices, including, without limitation, those practices prevailing in Litchfield County; 
(4)  The use of agricultural chemical, pesticides and fertilizers associated with normally accepted farming practices, including, without limitation, those practices prevailing in Litchfield County; and 
(5)  Irrigation and water management associated with normally accepted farming practices, including, without limitation, those practices prevailing in Litchfield County. 
    These provisions shall not apply whenever a nuisance results from the negligent or improper operation of any such agricultural operation. 
(Ord. of 2-19-2013(2)) 
§ 165-3. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
    Agricultural operations means activities relating to agricultural use including, but not limited to, the cultivation and tillage of soil, the burning of agricultural waste products or other agricultural burning, protection of crops and livestock from insects, pests, diseases, birds, predators or other pests damaging or could potentially damage crops, the proper and lawful use of agricultural chemicals, including but not limited to the application of pesticides and fertilizers, or the raising, production, irrigation, pruning, harvesting, or processing of an agricultural commodity, including any type of crop or livestock, and any forestry improvements and timber harvesting and processing. Such operations also include the operation and transportation of farm equipment over roads within the City and conducting agriculture-related educational and farm-based recreational activities, including agri-tourism, provided the activities are related to marketing the agricultural output or services of the farm and local produce and livestock products and provided same do not conflict with any provisions of the zoning regulations. For purposes of this chapter, such operations do not include the slaughtering of animals not raised on the premises where they are to be slaughtered. 
    Farm means a premises on which farming is conducted, including, without limitation, farm buildings, and accessory buildings thereto, nurseries, creameries, orchards, vineyards, ranges/pastures, greenhouses, hoop houses and other temporary structures or other structures used primarily for the raising and, as incidental and adjunctive to ordinary farming operations, the sale of locally, as in Litchfield Country, grow or raised agricultural or horticultural products. 
    Faming means cultivation of soil, dairying, forestry, milling, raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity, including the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training and management of livestock: the operation, management, conservation, improvement or maintenance of a farm and its buildings, tools and equipment. Farming does not include the storage, display or sale of crops, harvested products or produce that are not locally, as in Litchfield Country, grown or raised nor does it include the slaughtering of animals not raised on the premises where they are to be slaughtered. 
(Ord. of 2-19-2013(2)) 
§ 165-4. - Dispute resolution and advisory opinions. 
    The Mayor shall appoint, subject to confirmation by the City Council, a panel of five persons and two alternates to a Torrington Agricultural Council, with alternate terms for all members of the Council, to hear and mediate disputes that may arise out of farming practices and to issue advisory opinions concerning questions as to agricultural practices. 
    An interested person may submit a written request to the Council care of the Mayor's office for an opinion as to whether a particular agricultural operation constitutes a nuisance or is an activity that is incidental to normal and customary farming activity and comports with community standards. In the event a dispute arises between an agricultural operator and a resident in the City of Torrington as to whether a particular agricultural operation constitutes a nuisance, either interested party may submit a written request to the Council for an advisory opinion or to mediate the dispute. The Council may promulgate such regulations and procedures as it deems necessary for the implementation of this section. Nothing herein shall preclude any party from either appealing said advisory determination to the Superior Court for the Judicial District of Litchfield and/or commencing a direct action in said court to abate the claimed nuisance.

§ 170-5. - Development of user charges. 
    User charges will be determined as follows: 
A.  Class I Users (Residential): Flow is to be based on federal and state standards on a unit basis and will be 65,000 gallons per unit per year. 
B.  Class II Users (Commercial): Flow will be determined on the basis of actual metered water consumption, as reported by the Torrington Water Company, minus any water discharged under the federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit that is not discharged to the WPCF or based on meter readings of installed auxillary meter(s). (NOTE: if there should be a commercial establishment consisting of one establishment discharging to the system with a private water supply that is not metered, flow will be determined the same as Class I Users with each 1,780 square feet of gross floor area considered to be equivalent to one residential unit (65,000 gallons) minimum. Any commercial establishment with a private water supply that is not metered and consisting of more than one establishment, such as commercial and residential, flow will be determined the same as Class I Users with each 1,780 square feet of gross floor area of each unit considered to be equivalent to one residential unit (65,000 gallons) minimum and each establishment or individual unit being considered as a separate residential unit (65,000 gallons) and will be charged as two units, three establishments, three units, etc. Any commercial establishment with a private water supply determined by the Water Pollution Control Authority to discharge above the normal in quantity and/or strength will be calculated and charged under Class III users, as appropriate. 
C.  Class III-A User (Industrial-Sanitary Only) (under 5,000 gallons per day): Flow will be determined on the basis of actual metered water consumption as reported by the Torrington Water Company, minus any water discharged under federal permit that is not discharged to the WPCF. 
D.  Class III-B (Industrial-High Volume) (over 5,000 gallons per day): Flow will be determined on the basis of actual metered water consumption as reported by the Torrington Water Company, minus any waters discharged under federal permit that is not discharged to the WPCF. 
E.  Class III-C User (Industrial-Surcharge): Flow will be determined on the basis of actual metered water consumption as reported by the Torrington Water Company, minus any waters discharged under federal permit that is not discharged to the WPCF. (NOTE: Surcharge is calculated on the basis of state or independent testing and is charged under separate agreement.) 
F.  [Private water supply.] Any Class III User with a private water supply will be required to meter all water supply sources and/or discharge to sanitary sewer, river or other surface water. (NOTE: The City of Torrington may, at its option, require a sewer user to meter any private water supply source and/or discharge to sanitary sewer, river or other surface waters.)

§ 170-6. - Sewer user charge formula. 
A.  An annual sewer user charge shall be fixed and imposed on every sewer user. The sewer user charge shall be based on the following formula: 
C = U/E 
Where: 
C =  Charge per 65,000 gallons. 
U =  Amount to be raised by user fee (= total money needed for O & M + Debt Service - funds from other sources). 
E =  Equivalent number of users. 
B.  In any instance in which the city determined that biological oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), Total Nitrogen (TN) or other pollutant concentration from a user exceeds the range of concentrations of these pollutants in normal sewage, the city shall impose a surcharge computed in accordance with the following formula: 
C ub = (V u ) (8.34) × (B c ) (B-250) 
C us = (V u ) (8.34) × (S c ) (S-300) 
C up = (V u ) (8.34) × (P c ) (P-P n ) 
Where: 
C ub =  User's annual charge of treating pollutant surcharge for BOD (dollars per year). 
C us =  User's annual charge of treating pollutant surcharge for SS (dollars per year). 
C up =  User's annual charge of treating pollutant surcharge for additional pollutant (dollars per year). 
V u =  User's total annual volume to treatment plant (millions of gallons per year). 
B c =  O & M cost to treat BOD (dollars per pound). 
B =  User's concentration of BOD (milligrams per liter). 
S =  User's concentration of SS (milligrams per liter). 
P c =  O & M cost to treat additional pollutant (dollars per pound). 
P =  User's concentration of additional pollutant (milligrams per liter). 
NOTE: In no case shall any calculated pollutant surcharge be a negative value. 
C.  The minimum annual sewer user charge for each residential, commercial or industrial user shall be equal to the charge for one single-family residence. 
D.  Exemption of sewer use charge shall only be granted after the sewer lateral has been physically disconnected from the City of Torrington public sewer system. 
a.  Disconnection of the sewer lateral shall be disconnected at the Wye on the City of Torrington public sewer main.

    Infrastructure and site improvements shall be in conformance with City Standard Details and City Standards, Specifications, Rules and Regulations, which more specifically include driveway standards, street excavation requirements, right-of-way permit requirements, improvement completion requirements, infrastructure design requirements and Water Pollution Control Authority rules and regulations. The Standards, Specifications, Rules and Regulations are subject to annual updates and revisions by the City Engineer. Conditions encountered that are not covered within these Standards, Specifications, Rules and Regulations shall be resolved on a case-by-case basis at the direction of the City Engineer. 
§ 180-15.1. - Restoration of streets and sidewalks.

§ 180-15.2. - Protection and repair of utilities. 
    The permittee shall not interfere with any existing facility without the written consent of the owner of the facility. Relocation of existing facilities shall be done by its owner, should it become necessary. No facility owned by the City shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless approved by the City Engineer and the cost of such work is borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned facilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the facility owners. The permittee shall support and protect all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across the work. The permittee shall secure approval of method of support and protection from the owner of the facility. In case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, and for this purpose pipe coating or other encasement or devices are to be considered as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly notify the owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them, and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee. The exception to this case is in the event that the City's sanitary or storm sewer is damaged. The permittee is to notify the City of Torrington Water Pollution Control Authority and the City of Torrington Engineering Department immediately. The permittee is responsible to perform the necessary repairs under the inspection of the City prior to backfilling. It is the intent of this section that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to facilities and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such facility damage and such assumption of liability is a contractual obligation of the permittee. The only exception will be such instances where damage is exclusively due to the negligence of the owning utility. The City shall not be made a party to any action because of this section. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and location of all underground facilities and protect the same against damage. 
§ 180-15.3. - Protection of public property. 
A.  The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist in a public way without first obtaining the consent of the City Tree Warden. 
B.  Any monument set for the purpose of identifying, locating or preserving the lines of any street right-of-way or property, or a precise survey reference point, or a permanent survey bench mark within the City, shall not be removed or disturbed or caused to be removed or disturbed without first obtaining permission in writing from the City Engineer to do so. Permission to remove or disturb such monuments, reference points or bench marks shall be granted only when no alternate route for the proposed substructure or conduit is available. If the City Engineer is satisfied that no alternate route is available, permission shall be granted only upon condition that the person or utility applying for such permission shall pay all expenses incident to the proper replacement of this monument by a Connecticut-licensed land surveyor. Said monuments, reference points or bench marks shall not be disturbed until witnessing has been completed by a Connecticut-licensed land surveyor. The permittee shall be responsible for any damage to said monuments, reference points or bench marks. 
C.  No person or utility shall remove, damage, haul away or cause misalignment of any pavement, curbing, catch basins, manholes, pipes, castings, frames, and/or covers owned by the City for any reason whatsoever without first receiving written permission from the City Engineer. Any damage to the aforementioned items with or without a permit will subject the responsible person(s) to the requirements as listed in this article. 
§ 180-15.4. - Readjustment or removal of utility services. 
    The City Engineer may issue an appropriate order to any utility company or corporation to readjust, relocate, or remove its utility facility at the utility's expense for any municipal project within the City street right-of-way as is deemed necessary by the City Engineer. Failure to follow such order by any utility company or corporation shall be subject to fine defined under § 180-15.13, Enforcement; penalties for offenses. 
§ 180-15.5. - Excavation during winter. 
    No person or utility shall be granted a right-of-way permit or open any street or sidewalk from the time of December 1 of each year to April 1 of the following year unless an emergency or special condition exists and permission is obtained in writing from the City Engineer. Any person or utility wishing to obtain a right-of-way permit to perform right-of-way excavation work between these aforementioned dates shall first explain fully in writing the emergency situation or special condition existing to the City Engineer before a permit may be granted. If an emergency condition that could endanger life, health or property exists, this section shall not delay excavation work; however, a written explanation shall be delivered to the City Engineer the next business day and a right-of-way permit obtained for the work performed. A winter moratorium surcharge fee in the amount defined in § 180-15.12, Fees and charges shall be charged for an excavation made between the aforementioned dates that are not due to an emergency condition. For the purpose of this section, an "emergency" shall be defined as one of the following: damaged or leaking water or gas conduit systems, damaged, plugged or leaking sewer or storm drain conduit systems, damaged underground electrical and communications facilities, or downed overhead pole structures; all remaining excavations will be considered nonemergency situations and may only be authorized upon written documentation of special circumstances. 
§ 180-15.6. - Prompt completion of work required. 
    After an excavation is commenced, the permittee shall carry out with diligence and expedition all excavation work and shall promptly complete such work and restore the street or sidewalk as specified in this article. The permittee shall perform such restoration work so as not to obstruct, impede or create a safety hazard to public travel. On a highly traveled roadway, the trench excavations shall be temporarily patched with bituminous concrete on a daily basis. On less traveled roadways with average daily traffic counts below 100 vehicles per day, trenches may be temporarily topped with a gravel surface if weather conditions are dry and a paving schedule is submitted and approved by the City Engineer. Also, on less traveled roadways, excavated trenches may be kept open with adequate protection using steel plates and other traffic protection devices if approved by the City Engineer. If the work, including all street restoration, is not completed within the time shown on the permit or paving schedule submitted by the permittee, the City or its agent may complete the restoration and the permittee will be responsible for the cost of restoration. In the event an extension of time is required for permit performance, a written request shall be made to the City Engineer, with reasons for the delay, prior to the expiration of the permit. 
§ 180-15.7. - Emergency work. 
A.  Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the making of such excavations as may be necessary for the preservation of life, health or property or for the location of trouble in a conduit or pipe which may be a threat to life, health or property, or for making emergency repairs, provided that the person making such excavation shall apply to the City for such a permit on the first working day after such work is commenced. Before any excavation work is started, the person or utility excavating must contact all utilities for on-the-spot locations. The City Engineer shall determine whether said excavation required emergency action and whether a failure-to-obtain-permit charge is waived. 
B.  When traffic conditions, the safety or convenience of the traveling public or the public interest require that the excavation work be performed as emergency work, the City shall have the full power to order, at the time the permit is granted, that a crew and adequate facilities be employed by the permittee beyond normal working hours, including up to 24 hours a day, to the end that such excavation work may be completed as soon as possible. 
§ 180-15.8. - Warranty of work. 
A.  The permittee shall, for a period of 18 months thereafter, be fully liable for all defects in materials and workmanship relating to such excavations and shall promptly repair or replace the same upon notice of the City Engineer and to the satisfaction thereof. All street excavation repair warranty periods shall begin on the date the permanent pavement repair is approved in accordance with the sections of this article. 
B.  Pavement repairs. 
(1)  Pavement repairs guaranteed by each permittee shall meet all of the following conditions in order to remain in conformance with this article. 
(a)  The entire area shall be free from delamination of the approved surface material. 
(b)  No distortion of one-half inch or greater shall exist over more than five percent of the total surface area of the repair. 
(c)  No cracks of one-quarter inch or greater shall exist in the surface or edges of the repair totaling more than five percent of the repair perimeter. 
(d)  The hot-mixed asphalt within the trench shall not be completely flushed and bleeding. 
(2)  Nonconformance with any of the above conditions shall constitute a breach of guarantee and subject the permittee to remedial actions as provided in the sections of this article. 
C.  Each permittee is required to maintain his or her restoration work through the warranty period. Quick response is expected to any notice received about a malfunction or failure to the work area. The City will attempt to notify the permittee before emergency maintenance is performed. However, the permittee must provide appropriate emergency contact person(s) and phone number(s). If the permittee is not reachable at the emergency contact number(s) or fails to maintain or repair the problem within the required 24-hour time period, the City may cause the necessary repairs to be accomplished, and shall keep an account of the expense thereof, and in such case the permittee shall be billed as defined under § 180-15.12, Fees and charges. Bills rendered in accordance with this section shall be due and payable by the permittee immediately upon receipt. 
D.  The City shall issue no further or new permits to the permittee until full payment of the billed costs have been received. Funds received shall be deposited into the Street Restoration Account. The City may use the security deposit as specified in § 180-15.12, Fees and charges, toward any unpaid invoices. If for any reason, the City has to perform repair work to an excavation after the permittee's guarantee period has started, that guarantee period shall start over again upon completion of the repairs. The presence of City personnel during the performance of any work within the street right-of-way shall not relieve the permittee of its responsibilities hereunder. 
§ 180-15.9. - Inspections. 
    The permittee shall make a request for inspection at least 24 hours prior to the time of commencement of excavation. The City shall make such inspections as are reasonably necessary in the enforcement of this Right-of-Way Ordinance. Any work done without inspection will be considered defective. All defective work will be subject to re-excavation for inspection at the order of the City Engineer. Inspections requested by the permittee outside the regular City working hours (7:00 a.m. through 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding holidays) shall pay the required overtime rate for the period being worked, using the City Inspector's hourly overtime rate structure. The inspection fee for the project shall be based upon the actual total of overtime hours worked and deducted from the deposit if necessary. The City Engineer may order such actions as it deems necessary to insure that this article is not violated. 
§ 180-15.10. - Shop drawings and testing requirements. 
A.  The permittee shall submit to the City Engineer for approval four copies of the manufacturer and vendor's drawings of any specially fabricated and assembled items, including technical data, installation drawings, and setting drawings. Shop drawings are required for reinforced concrete construction and fabricated steel items. All shop drawings, etc., and/or printed matter submitted shall be properly identified by project, location and specific application with reference to specification items. No construction, purchase, delivery, installation or work shall be performed which is dependent on shop drawing review. Any comments, corrections or revisions must be resubmitted for approval prior to commencing work. 
B.  The permittee is to provide a sieve analysis on materials to be used prior to placement of such to insure compliance with CDOT Standard Specifications, Form 816. 
C.  The City Engineer may require the permittee to perform his own compaction testing as the project progresses to insure compliance with compaction specifications. The City may conduct random spot testing upon the completion of the work for verification that the work has been done in accordance with City of Torrington Standard Details and Technical Specifications, CDOT Standard Specifications, Form 816, and sections of this article. The permittee shall pay for all testing and retesting to verify the proper restoration in accordance with this article. 
§ 180-15.11. - Filing of improvement location survey.

This as-built map(s) shall be provided to the City no later than 30 days after the completion date of construction in paper and in digital file in the same format as the version of AutoCAD or other computer-aided drafting program currently being used by the City of Torrington Engineering Department. 
§ 180-15.12. - Fees and charges. 
    No permit shall be issued without appropriate payment of fees. 
A.  Subdivision inspection fee. Prior to issuance of a City grading permit, the developer or permittee shall pay to the City of Torrington an inspection fee of up to five percent the total construction cost for street and infrastructure improvements. The total construction cost is based on a cost estimate submitted by the developer's or permittee's contractor and approved by the City Engineer. Construction costs include, but are not limited to, new pavement, curbs, driveway aprons, storm drainage and stormwater management facilities, demolition and clearing, erosion control, landscaping, and other miscellaneous improvements. The minimum fee shall be $100.00. 
B.  Right-of-way permit. Each right-of-way permit may be assessed the following fees. All fees below shall be in the format of a cashier's check payable to the "City of Torrington" and shall be paid at time of issuance of the right-of-way permit. Checks shall be deposited into the City's Street Restoration Account. 
(1)  Administrative fee. This fee shall reimburse the City for the direct cost of labor and equipment necessary for the administration of this article. The fee shall be $25.00. 
(2)  Street maintenance fee. This fee is assessed for the long-term maintenance of City streets. This fee is used as partial funding support for the City Street Restoration Program. This fee shall be applied only to permits involving opening of street pavement. The street maintenance fee is based on plan measurements. The City may measure as-built field conditions when actual disturbed area exceeds the plan quantity. Any increase of the linear footage may be assessed accordingly. Checks shall be deposited into the City's Street Restoration Account. The fee is based on the following schedule: 
Disturbed Pavement Pavement Opening Linear Feet Fee Per Cut Perpendicular cut 0 to 100 $200.00 Longitudinal cut 0 to 100 $200.00 Longitudinal cut Over 100 $200.00, plus $5.00 per linear foot  
(3)  Additional charges. All necessary materials, traffic aids, and labor furnished by the City for work that the permittee fails to perform shall be billed an amount equal to 150 percent of the total expense incurred by the City. Also, an inspection fee shall be charged for overtime work as specified in § 180-15.9, Inspections. Charges shall include testing fees as defined in § 180-15.10, Shop drawings and testing requirements. These charges are in addition to other permit fees. Charges include replacement of traffic signal loop detectors, electrical wires and conduit, and communication cables if damaged. 
(4)  Security deposit and performance bond. If the City elects to take action to remedy a problem due to the failure of the permittee to complete, maintain or repair the work or is unreachable at the emergency contact number(s) as specified under § 180-15.8, Warranty of work, the permittee shall be billed an amount equal to 150 percent of the total expense incurred by the City. The security deposit shall be set by the City Engineer for each excavation to be made in the City right-of-way, but shall not be less than $1,000.00 per permit. Such a deposit shall serve as security for the repair and performance of work necessary to put the right-of-way area in as good a condition as it was prior to the work if the permittee fails to make the necessary repairs or to complete the proper refilling of the opening and the excavation work under the right-of-way permit. The City may use any or all of such deposit to pay the cost of any work the City or hired City subcontractor may perform to restore or maintain the City right-of-way as herein provided in the event the permittee fails to perform such work, in which event the amount refunded to the permittee shall be reduced by the amount thus expended by the City. Any settlement of the surface within the warranty period shall be deemed conclusive evidence of defective backfilling or construction by the permittee. Upon written request by the permittee, such cash deposit shall be returned to the permittee without interest after expiration of the guarantee period given all work covered by such permit is in conformity with City standards and accepted by the City as complete.

4.15 INCENTIVE HOUSING OVERLAY ZONE (IH) (EFF. 1/31/11)
4.15.1 Purpose.
A. The Incentive Housing Overlay Zone (IH) is adopted pursuant to the authority of Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 124b. Its purpose is to encourage affordable housing in both residential and business districts that have the transportation connections, nearby access to amenities and services, and infrastructure necessary to support concentrations of development.
B. The IH seeks to avoid sprawl and traffic congestion by encouraging a more vibrant residential component to business or mixed use areas to sustain a lifestyle in which residents can walk or use public transportation to reach jobs, services, and recreational or cultural opportunities.
C. It is a further purpose that the IH enable development and reuse of existing, historic or underutilized buildings or properties in Torrington that may otherwise be lost to progress.
4.15.2 General Requirements.
A. Any such zone shall be in compliance with the locational requirements of Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 1245b.
B. Subzones.
34
1. The Commission may designate subzones within an overall IH in which different types of uses may be permitted, as in the case of a mixed-use incentive housing development.
2. Each IH may consist of one or more subzones, which may overlay each other as well as the underlying district. Within any IH, there may be any or all of three (3) subzones, designated as:
a. Townhouse TH Subzone,
b. Multi-family MF Subzone, or
c. Mixed-use MU Subzone.
4.15.3 Bulk Requirements
A. The following Bulk Requirements shall apply when an IHZ project is proposed. The requirements in the Underlying Zone (UZ) remain in effect when noted UZ.
NOTES:
1 The Minimum density may be reduced to 15 units per acre for portions of the site developed as Townhouse units.
B. Density.
1. Density is calculated by the number of units allowed per area.
2. Where an incentive housing development contains a mix of the above dwelling types, the land occupied by non-residential uses will be included in the residential density calculation. The residential densities will be calculated by apportioning the total acreage of the incentive housing development in the same proportion that each type of housing bears to the total number of dwelling units.

4.15.10 Design Standards.
A. Applicable Standards. Incentive Housing Development applications shall apply the design criteria identified in the Torrington Design Review Guidelines  Downtown Historic Area. In adopting the design criteria of Torrington Design Review Guidelines  Downtown Historic Area the Commission has considered design standards that:
1. ensure that development is complementary to adjacent or neighboring buildings or structures and consistent with the housing plan provided for in Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-13p, and
2. address the scale or proportions of buildings; site coverage; alignment, width or grade of streets or sidewalks; type or location of infrastructure; location of building or garage entrances; off-street parking; protection of significant natural site features; location or design of open spaces; signage; or setbacks or buffering from adjacent properties; provided that the applications of such standards will not unreasonably impair the economic or physical feasibility of constructing housing at the minimum densities and with the required incentive housing restriction set forth in this Section.
4.15.11 Application Processing For Incentive Housing Developments.
A. Incentive Housing Development Proposed within an Existing Incentive Housing Overlay Zone. For incentive housing developments involving land already designated as an Incentive Housing Overlay Zone on the Torrington Zone Map, applicants shall submit a site plan application in accordance with Section 8.4 of these regulations.
40
1. The Commission shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with the timeframe requirements in Section 8-7d(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes.
2. The Commission shall forward the application to Architectural Review Committee for review, in accordance with Section 8.5 of these regulations.
B. Application to Expand an Existing Incentive Housing Overlay Zone, or Establish a New Incentive Housing Overlay Zone. For projects involving land not designated as an Incentive Housing Zone on the Torrington Zoning Map, applicants shall submit a zoning map amendment application in accordance with Section 8.7 of these regulations. Upon approval of the zoning map amendment, the applicant may seek approval in accordance with subsection A above.
4.15.12 Decision Considerations.
A. Approval of an incentive housing development. The Commission may waive any standards that would unreasonably impair the economic or physical feasibility of constructing dwellings at minimum densities or with required incentive housing restrictions set forth in this Section. The Commission will approve an incentive housing development subject only to conditions necessary to:
1. ensure substantial compliance of any proposed development with the requirements of this Section, the design standards of these regulations and, if applicable, the subdivision regulations; or
2. to mitigate any extraordinary adverse impacts of development on nearby properties.
B. Denial of an incentive housing development application. An application may be denied only on the grounds:
1. the development does not meet the requirements set forth in this Section;
2. the applicant failed to submit information or fees required by the regulations and necessary for an adequate and timely review of the design or potential impacts of the development; or
3. it is not possible to adequately mitigate significant adverse project impacts on nearby properties by means of conditions acceptable to the applicant.
4.15.13 Method of Ownership.
A. Dwelling units. Dwelling units may be offered for sale or for rental in individual, public, cooperative or condominium ownership. Documentation as to management, organization and incorporation of applicable ownership associations shall be submitted to the Commission at the time of filing of the application for incentive housing development.
B. Methods of Open Space Reservation. All open space or supporting facilities and systems will be in compliance with applicable law and provide for maintenance, liability, financing or rights of access and use by residents of the incentive housing development as is acceptable to the Commission. Open space areas required will be permanently reserved for the designated use by means acceptable to and approved by the Commission, such as, but not limited to:
41
1. Deeded to the Town. Where open space areas are to be conveyed to the Town, the applicant will convey them at the stage and in the condition agreed upon in connection with the processing and approval of the subdivision.
2. Deeded to a non-profit organization acceptable to the Commission. Such nonprofit organization will be a private non-profit, non-stock corporation that has as its purpose the preservation of open space land. The deed to such organization will contain language satisfactory to the Commission requiring that the land be held in perpetuity as open space land for the use of the public. If open space is to be conveyed to a non-profit organization, the Commission may require that a copy of the organization's Certificate of Incorporation be submitted for its review. The deed to the organization will contain the provision that in event of the dissolution of the corporation, the property will be conveyed to the Town, or subject to the approval of the Commission, to another non-profit corporation. The Commission will have the right to reject any proposal for the transfer of open space land to a private non-profit organization if the Commission determines that such conveyance would not be in the best interest of the Town.
3. Held in corporate ownership by owners of lots within the development. Open space may be conveyed by warranty deed to a homeowner's association within the development upon such terms and conditions as specified by the Commission. When tracts are conveyed in this manner, a copy of the by-laws of the homeowners' association will be submitted as a part of the application for the IHZ Development. Membership in such corporation will be mandatory for all lot owners within the development. Each deed conveyance to lot owners will include the membership stipulation, the beneficial right in use of the open land or all other pertinent restrictions, and will be recorded in the Torrington Land Records. Wording on each deed will state that such open land is reserved for use only as open space in perpetuity.
4. Perpetual easement. Where the right of use, interest or privilege, short of fee ownership in the open space owned by another, is obtained by the City or acceptable non-profit organization, a deed stipulating that the owner transfers development rights to, and open space or scenic easements over, the land will be required, the fee owner will retain the fee tide to the premises and all incidents of fee ownership, except the right to construct any structure, sign, fence or other improvement, or to alter the contours. Minimum lot requirements cannot be satisfied by use of land dedicated to open space.
C. Conditions of Open Space Conveyance. Title to the open space land will be unencumbered and will be transferred at a time approved by the Commission, and in any case, not later than the time at which title to the streets in the development is accepted by the town.
42
D. Deed Guarantees. Regardless of the method employed, the instrument of the open space conveyance must include provisions suitable to the Commission and its Legal Counsel for guaranteeing the following:
1. Continuity of proper maintenance for those portions of the common open space land requiring maintenance;
2. When appropriate, the availability of funds required for such maintenance; and
3. Recovering of loss sustained by casualty, condemnation or otherwise.

5.6.5 Maximum Number of Lots (rev. 12-16-10)
A. The Maximum number of lots shall be determined by using a density yield formula. The requirements in the following table are the density factors for each zone:
Zone
RWP
RWP(sewer)
R60
R40
R25
R15/15s
R10/10s
Density Factor (lots per acre)
0.32
0.42
0.47
0.69
1.35
1.69
2.47
The Density Factor is multiplied by the lot size (area determined by a Class A-2 Survey prepared by a Connecticut-licensed land surveyor), after areas classified as Inland Wetlands and Watercourses in CGS 22a-36 to 22a-45 (www.cga.ct.gov/2009/pub/Chap440.htm), as identified by a Certified Soil Scientist and steep slopes (slopes greater than 25 percent) have been subtracted.
Development Yield Formula: (LS-IWW  SS) x DF = Number of Lots
LS = Lot Size (as determined by a Class A-2 Survey)
IWW = Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
SS = Steep Slopes
DF = Density Factor for the zone
B. On sites not served by public sewer, soil suitability for individual septic systems shall be documented in a written certified statement by a Connecticut licensed Professional Engineer or the Torrington Area Health District.
C. On sites not served by public water, site suitability for private wells shall be documented in a written certified statement by the Torrington Area Health District.
D. Lot Design Considerations. The following design elements are required:
1. No Flag Lots are allowed. Each lot shall have sufficient frontage to provide a front yard along the street for the entire length of the structure.
2. Each driveway shall have proper sightlines.
3. Lots with on-site septic systems: Each lot needs to provide ample land area for a code-complying system, reserve system and well radius. The well radium may extend over property lines in the following instances: Over permanently protected open space, or over a town owned right-of-way.
5.6.6 Minimum Open Space
A. The minimum acreage of open space shall be 50% of the gross acreage of land to be subdivided.
B. The open space required by the Subdivision Regulations shall be counted towards meeting the minimum open space required in Section A above.
51
5.6.7 Open Space
The location and configuration of the open space shall be subject to the approval of the Commission. The purposes include, but are not limited to, protection of historic features, protection of scenic vistas, provision of areas for active recreation, buffering of adjacent properties, protection of natural areas and protection of farmland.
To the extent practicable, the open space shall be contiguous and useable. Fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various areas of the development, unless the conservation feature in linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails.
Open Space shall be consistent with the Torrington Open Space Plan and/or Torrington Plan of Conservation and Development. (Rev. 2/1/06)
5.6.8 Disposition of Open Space
The method of preservation and disposition of the open space shall be subject to the approval of the Commission. The methods used may include, but are not limited to, the following:
A. establishment of a neighborhood, or homeowners, association to own and maintain the land for the open space purposes intended;
B. transfer of the land to a not for profit organization or similar entity to own and maintain the land for the open space purposes;
C. transfer of the land to the City of Torrington; or
D. endow maintenance of usable public open space, developed as part of the subdivision.
5.6.9 Adjoining Properties
To ensure compatibility with existing residential subdivisions, the Commission may require that proposed lots adjacent to, or across the street from, residentially zoned areas conform to the zoning district. The Commission may also require a buffer to separate the conservation subdivision from adjoining properties.
5.6.10 Site Planning Procedures
Plans prepared under the Conservation Subdivision section shall meet the provisions, procedures and design standards of the Torrington Zoning Regulations unless otherwise stated. Elements of the Conservation Subdivision process are:
A. Pre-Application Conference: Before submitting an application for a conservation subdivision, the subdivider shall schedule a meeting introducing the applicant to the City staff to review the Zoning Regulations, procedures for approval including submittal requirements and design standards. This meeting is to facilitate better communication between the City and the subdivider thereby saving time and creating a better subdivision for all parties. For the meeting, the
52
subdivider is to prepare preliminary mapping including an Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map along with a Preliminary Development Sketch Plan.
1. Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map - a review and analysis of the sites unique or sensitive natural areas including:
a. Hydrological characteristics, including surface water bodies, floodplains, groundwater recharge and discharge areas, wetlands, vernal pools, natural and manmade swales, watershed divides, drainage ways and steep slopes (25%).
b. Land cover on site (pasture, woodland etc.) and specimen trees with a caliper greater than 24 inches dbh. Include comments on health and condition of vegetation and identify any stands of invasive plants.
c. List current and past uses with the location of all buildings and structures on the land, cultivated areas, waste sites and history of waste disposal practices, paved areas, and all encumbrances such as easements or covenants.
d. Known critical habitat areas for rare, threatened or endangered species.
e. Scenic views into and out of the property.
f. Unique geological resources such as rock outcrops and glacial features.
g. Cultural resources including a brief description of the historic character of buildings, structures, old roads and historically important landscape and archeological features. Locate fences, stone walls and other existing landscape elements.
After all existing elements are inventoried; indicate areas of development and areas to be conserved. In the absence of sewer availability provide indicate soils suitable for septic systems. Any adjacent properties with protected open space should be identified.
This map may be done as an overlay to aerial photographs or topographic survey (contours at 2' min) to a scale of 1"=100' min. and should be prepared by a landscape architect or other qualified professional such as an environmental consultant, environmental engineer, or physical planner.
2. Concept Development Sketch Plan - Sets out the overall concept for the proposed subdivision showing areas of proposed development and areas of conservation. The Sketch should be done as an overlay to the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map. This plan may be hand-drawn but in sufficient detail to examine and review conditions. Home sites are to be positioned to take maximum advantage of the existing landforms, solar orientation, scenic views etc. Indicate number and type of units proposed (single family, multi-family etc.) The Concept Development Sketch Plan should complement the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map and when used as an
53
overlay to the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map will clearly show how well, or how poorly, the proposed layout avoids areas of the site prioritized for conservation. Calculations regarding the maximum number of permitted lots pursuant to Section 5.6.5 should be submitted along with the Concept Development Sketch Plan.
3. Site Walk - The Commission may request a site walk during the application process. The Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map and the Concept Development Sketch Plan will be used for orientation.
B. Application: After the pre-application conference, the applicant can make any necessary changes to the preliminary design and develop the proposed subdivision plans. The City staff can meet as needed to review any changes to the overall design. Drawing requirements and application requirements are outlined in detail on the subdivision/resubdivision application.

2. Buffers shall not contain buildings, structures, parking, storage areas, dumpsters, signs, impervious surfaces, or other such uses.
3. Buffers shall be located to provide the maximum visual buffer between adjoining uses.
4. Where the number of spaces in a single parking area exceeds fifty spaces and this parking area abuts a required buffer, the Commission may require:
a. The buffer be increased by an additional 10 feet in width; and/or
b. A berm with an average height of four feet as measured from the lot line to the edge of the parking lot is to be constructed. The intent is to screen the parking lot from view.
5. Existing vegetation may be used to satisfy the buffer requirements provided equivalent visual protection is provided and the buffer is a minimum of fifteen feet wide. Non-deciduous trees and shrubs shall be added to supplement the existing vegetation if the Commission determines it is necessary to provide a year round visual buffer. Note that the removal of specimen trees and significant trees is regulated by Section 5.16.
6. Stormwater Structure Landscaping.
Stormwater management systems shall be visually compatible with the surrounding landscape and should have sufficient vegetation to screen adjacent properties. Where appropriate, Low Impact Development/Design stormwater solutions shall be utilized. Basin landscaping shall provide for stormwater quality remediation.
B. BUFFER REQUIREMENTS - SPECIFIC (Rev. 8-22-02)
The purpose of the buffer area is to:
1. Provide visual screening for buildings, parking areas, loading areas, outside storage areas and ground fixed mechanical equipment to protect property values and enhance the appearance of the community;
2. To reduce surface water runoff and minimize soil erosion through the natural filtering and renovation capability of landscaped areas;
3. To minimize environmental nuisances such as glare and noise.
This regulation is intended to be a flexible, performance based regulation that allows the applicant to demonstrate to the Commission that the buffer area proposed provides the proper physical separation and visual screening between the proposed use and the adjacent to or across the street residential zone.
Within the buffer area the applicant shall provide screening for parking areas, loading areas, outside storage areas and ground fixed mechanical equipment. Acceptable screening materials may include, existing vegetation on the property, where the existing vegetation is of a nature that it will effectively screen the use from the view of adjoining properties, earthen berms, solid fences or walls, trees
62
and evergreen plantings of such species, height and spacing, that in the judgment of the Commission will effectively screen the use. The applicant may propose any combination of the above screening materials. The screening shall be effective year round. The placement, width and design of the screening portion of the buffer shall be approved by the Commission.
In addition to the required landscaping plan per Sections 5.11 and 8.4.3 I, the applicant shall supply sectional drawings and photographs which demonstrate through use of existing topography, existing vegetation and or screening materials above, the proposed plan provides the proper physical separation and visual screening between the proposed use and adjacent to or across the street residential zones. (See example illustrations in figure 1 below.)
The location of the proposed screening shall be located to provide the maximum visual buffer between adjoining uses. If existing woodlands are located within the required buffer area, the applicant is encouraged to preserve these woodlands and supplement with non-deciduous trees, berm, solid fence or wall to provide the required year round screening.
The Commission may require additional landscaping or more mature plantings where unusual conditions dictate more extensive screening or for noise abatement purposes to reduce depreciation of adjacent residential properties in a residential zone. At the request of the applicant, the Commission may determine that the requirement for a landscaped buffer area is not necessary along a property line adjoining a permanently protected open space or some other similar situation where property values or community appearance would not be adversely affected.
Buffer areas shall not contain buildings, accessory structures, parking, storage areas, dumpsters, impervious surfaces except as noted below. The Commission may allow certain improvements to encroach within the buffer areas such as storm systems, detention/retention basins, underground utilities including sanitary lines, access drives for emergency vehicles, inter-lot connector drives, utility boxes, sidewalks and the like. Where possible encroachments in the buffer area will traverse the buffer area in such a manner so that the view is not continuous through the buffer.
Note: The buffer requirements are in addition to the landscaping requirements of Section 5.11 for front yards and parking areas. The removal of specimen trees and significant trees is regulated by Section 5.16.
C. Buffer Requirements Local Business and Industrial Zone
All yards which are adjacent to a residential zone shall contain a twenty-five foot wide buffer.
D. Buffer Requirements Industrial Park Zone
63
All yards which are adjacent to or across the street from a residential zone shall contain a seventy-five foot wide buffer. The Commission may by special exception permit reduce this required buffer to not less than the required building setbacks. The Commission will consider the adjacent uses, existing topography and/or exiting vegetation in evaluating reduction of the required buffer.
E. Buffer Requirements Residential Zones
Uses permitted by special exception in a residential zone shall be separated by a landscaped buffer. The landscaped buffer area shall be designed to screen parking areas and special exception uses from adjoining residential properties.

The City of Torrington understands the needs of its citizens to communicate and convey messages regarding their businesses, beliefs or events. These regulations attempt to manage those needs and balance them with the Citys overall need to maintain its character, ensure the safety of its citizens and create visual harmony within the community.
The purpose of a sign is to provide information about various services and goods, as well as communicate messages that are fundamental to the welfare of the public (e.g. traffic signs). Because of possible harmful impacts, signs must be regulated to:

84
pre-cast concrete patio block within the front yard setback of the property where the sign will be permitted to be displayed. For properties with multiple tenants the 2 x 2 pre-cast concrete patio blocks will be adjusted in field to assure clear sightlines are maintained and no sign blocks another excessively.
4. No portable signs will be allowed in any public right of way with the exception of those within a public sidewalk where no front yard/free-standing sign is available.
5. A portable sign area shall count in the calculation of maximum sign total for a property. Only one side of the sign shall be used in the calculation.

Temporary Sign  A portable sign not permanently affixed to the ground, meant to be used for a defined period of time. Temporary signs are permitted for one 30-day period, five times a calendar year. A single zoning permit will be required for the temporary sign, renewed annually, that will outline the (5) 30-day periods the business intends to use. Banners are not temporary signs.
Wall Sign  Any sign attached parallel to a wall of a building or structure. The sign is supported by the building or structure and at its closest point, is within 10 inches of the

supporting wall.
Window Sign  Any non-illuminated sign painted or attached to the inside of a window. The sign is visible from the exterior of the building.

If a window sign is illuminated it shall be treated as a wall sign and will be included in the calculation of the maximum total sign area. No more than 50% of the window area can be covered with window signage. It is recommended by the Torrington Police Department that the window area near the register remain unblocked for safety concerns.
5.15.3 Computing the Area and Height of Signs
A. The area of a sign shall be computed by including the entire area within the smallest rectangle or square that will encompass the extreme limits of form, illumination, symbol, writing or other display. Any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or building against which it is placed shall be included in the area.
B. The height of a sign shall be measured from the average finished grade 5 feet out from the sign support, pylon, structure or wall on which the sign is attached to the highest part of the sign or supporting structure including finials, decorative cornices and other decorations, numbers or lights associated with the sign. The grade cannot be altered by filling, berming, excavating or other means for the purpose of altering the height of the sign.
5.15.4 Maximum Total Sign Area
A. Except as specified below the maximum total sign area of all signs on a building or structure shall not exceed two (2) square foot of sign per one (1) lineal foot of building frontage with the exception of E. & F.

Section 5.17 Lighting Regulations (added 6-19-19)
5.17.1. PURPOSE
These regulations are intended to provide specific standards for lighting in order to maximize the effectiveness of site lighting, to enhance public safety and welfare, to raise public awareness of energy conservation, to avoid unnecessary upward illumination, indirect lighting and illumination of adjacent properties, and to reduce glare.
5.17.2. APPLICABILITY
Except as herein provided, these regulations shall apply to any outdoor lighting fixtures installed, modified, refurbished, repaired or serviced within the City of Torrington.
All businesses, and community roadways, sidewalks and town property luminaires should be planned and installed with the idea of being a good neighbor by keeping unnecessary direct light from shining onto abutting lots or roadways, both public and private.
5.17.3 DEFINITIONS
Direct light: light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire.
Direct light source: the lamp or bulb that produces the actual light.
Full Cut-Off Type Fixture: A luminaire or light fixture that; by design of the housing, does not allow any light dispersion or direct glare to shine above a 90 degree horizontal plane from the base, or the purpose of the design is defeated, and disability glare will result.
Fully Shielded Lights: Fully shielded luminaire light fixtures allow you to control the glare in any direction.
Glare: Light emitting from a luminaire with intensity great enough to reduce a viewers ability to see, and in extreme cases causing momentary blindness.
Height of Luminaries: The height of luminaries shall be the vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the luminaire.
Indirect Lighting: Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other surfaces.
Isodiagram: An Isodiagram is a graphical representation of points of equal illuminance drawn as single line circular patterns or computer generated spot readings in a grid pattern on a site plan. Lighting designers and manufacturers generate these diagrams to show the level and evenness of a lighting design and to show how light fixtures will perform on a given site.
Lamp: The light source component of luminaries that produces the actual light.
Light Pollution: Stray or reflected light that is emitted into the atmosphere, beyond the 90-degree horizontal plane. Dust, water, vapor and other pollutants reflect this light causing unwanted sky-glow.
Light Trespass: Light from an artificial light source that is intruding into an area where it is not wanted or does not belong.
Lumen: A unit of luminous flux. One-foot candle is one lumen per square foot. For the purposes of this regulation, the lumen-output values shall be the INITIAL lumen output ratings of a lamp.
Luminaire: A complete lighting system, and includes a lamp or lamps and a fixture or an LED assembly.
91
Outdoor Lighting: The night-time illumination of an outside area or object by any man-made device located outdoors that produces light by any means.
Ratio: Uniformity ratio, describing the average level of illumination in relation to the lowest level of illumination for a given area. Example: U ratio = 4:1 for the given area, the lowest level of illumination (1) should be no less than 1/4 or 4 times less than the average (4) level of illumination.
Uplighting: Any light source that distributes illumination above a 90 degrees horizontal plane.
5.17.4 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
1. All exterior lights and sign illumination shall be designed, located, installed and directed in such a manner as to:
a. Prevent direct or objectionable glare, light trespass, spill light, or obtrusive light;
b. Be shielded if required to control light trespass.
c. Employ soft, transitional light levels that are consistent from area to area;
d. Minimize contrast between light sources, lit areas and dark surroundings;
e. Be confined within the target area.
f. Use full cut off fixtures.
2. In all non-residential districts and in all areas adjacent to a residential lot, no externally mounted direct light source shall be visible at the lot line at ground level or above. The illumination measured at the lot line shall be zero (0.0) foot-candles, excluding driveway entrances.
3. Lighting designed to highlight flagpoles shall be low level (no more than 100-watt incandescent equivalent) and shall be targeted directly at the flag.
4. Lighting shall include timers or dimmers or sensors to reduce unnecessary light level during non-business hours to a minimum level required for overnight security.
5. The height of luminaries, except streetlights in public right-of-ways, shall be the minimum height necessary to provide adequate illumination, but shall not exceed a height of twenty-four (24) feet. The height of a luminaire shall be measured from the finished grade (not the top of a supporting concrete base) to the bottom of the luminaire.
6. Light standards within a parking lot shall be located within landscaped islands or buffer strips, where possible and shall be set back two (2) feet from any parking space unless wheel-stops are provided.
7. In reviewing and approving outdoor lighting, the Commission may utilize recommendations for lighting levels as issued by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, the International Dark-Sky Association, or other reference.
8. The use of owner owned utility poles for outdoor lighting is permitted provided they meet the requirements of Section 5.17.4.
9. Any light determined by the ZEO to be obtrusive, spill light, upward lighting, light trespass, or otherwise not in compliance with these regulations shall constitute a violation.
10. A photometric survey shall be submitted as part of any site plan that demonstrates compliance with these standards.
11. Exemptions: Traditional seasonal lighting and temporary lighting used by Police, Fire Department or Emergency services are exempt from these regulations

7.2.2 General Provisions
A. Land to Which this Regulation Applies - This section shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the City.
B. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard - The Areas of Special Flood Hazard, also called the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the City of Torrington, dated October 4, 1982, accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFM), both dated April 4, 1983, and other supporting data applicable to the City of Torrington, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA.
The SFHA includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A and AE, including areas designated as a floodway on a FBFM. SFHAs are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location. The FIRM, FBFM and FIS are on file in the Planning and Zoning Department, 140 Main Street, Torrington.
C. Zoning Permit - A zoning permit is required prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of special flood hazard.
D. Compliance - No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this regulation and other applicable regulations.
E. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions - This regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this regulation and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
F. Interpretation - In the interpretation and application of this regulation all provisions shall be:
1. considered as minimum requirements;
2. liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
3. deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
G. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability - The degree of flood protection required by this regulation is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This regulation does not imply that land outside the areas of Special Flood Hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This regulation shall not create liability on the part of the City of Torrington or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this regulation or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.
H. Severability - If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this regulation should be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this regulation, which shall remain in full force and effect; and to this end the provisions of this regulation are hereby declared to be severable.
7.2.3 Requirements for Flood Hazard Reduction
A. General Standards - In all areas of Special Flood Hazard, the following provisions shall apply.
1. New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
2. New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
3. New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
4. The bottom of all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, HVAC ductwork, and other service facilities, or any machinery or utility equipment or connections servicing a structure shall be elevated at or above the base flood elevation (BFE) to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This includes, but is not limited to, furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, hot water heaters, ventilation ductwork, washer and dryer hook-ups, electrical junction boxes, and circuit breaker boxes. Utility connections that must be located below the BFE shall be designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
5. New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
6. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the system into flood waters.
7. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
8. In any portion of a watercourse which is altered or re-located the flood carrying capacity shall be maintained.
9. Manufactured Homes - All manufactured homes (including mobile homes and recreational vehicles placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer) to be placed or substantially improved, including those located outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing park which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, shall be:
a. elevated so that the lowest floor is above the base flood elevation;
b. placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement, and hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures; anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors;
c. installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage; elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than 10 feet apart, and the provision of reinforcements for piers more than six feet above ground level; and
d. adequate access and drainage should be provided.
e. recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, OR (iii) meet all the general standards of Section 7.2.3 A. and the elevation and anchoring requirement of Section 7.2.3. A. 9 a-d. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
10. Compensatory Storage - The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality.
11. Equal Conveyance - Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
12. Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated at or above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.
13. New construction, substantial improvements, and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely over water unless it is a functionally dependent use or facility.
B. Standards for Stream Without Established Base Flood Elevations and/or Flooding (Rev. 8/2/99)
1. The Zoning Enforcement Officer or Environmental Planner shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, including data developed pursuant to Section 7.2.5.D of this regulation, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on the Citys FIRM meet the standards in Sections 7.2.3 A. and C.
2. In A zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development.
3. Should data be requested and/or provided, the City shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the waters surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse.
C. Specific Standards
1. In all areas of special flood hazard A, A1-30, AE, the following provisions shall apply:
a. Residential Construction - New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least 1 foot above the base flood elevation.
b. Non-Residential Construction - New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure located in Zone A, A1-30 and AE shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least 1 foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or such structures may be flood-proofed at least 1 foot above the level of the base flood elevation in lieu of being elevated provided that, together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, the areas of the structure below the required elevation are water tight with wall substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be provided to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer or Environmental Planner as set forth in Section 7.2.4.C.
2. Fully Enclosed Areas Below Base Flood Elevation - New construction or substantial improvements of buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and/or other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
a. provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
b. the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
c. openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions;
d. electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevation; and
e. access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
D. Floodways -Located within area of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways on the City's Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or as determined in Section 7.2.2.B of this regulation. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris and potential projectiles and have erosion potential no encroachments including fill and construction of substantial improvements and other development shall not be permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachment shall not result in any 0.0 feet increase in flood levels during currents of the base flood discharge.

a. a showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c. a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
3. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage.
4. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
7.3 Sedimentation and Erosion Controls (Rev. 8/2/99)
7.3.1 Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (rev. 12-16-2010)
A. The Commission finds that trees and other vegetative ground cover play an important role in controlling erosion by: protecting the soil surface from the impact of falling rain; holding soil particles in place, enhancing the soils capacity to absorb water; slowing the velocity of runoff; removing subsurface water between rain falls through the process of evapo-transpiration and improving infiltration rates.
B. Therefore, for purposes of this Section, clear-cutting or removal of trees and other vegetative ground cover, regardless of whether stumps and root systems are removed, shall be considered an erosion factor equivalent to grading and other forms of soil disturbance, and references in this section of soil disturbance and/or grading shall include clear-cutting or removal of trees and vegetative ground cover.
C. A soil erosion and sediment control plan shall be submitted with any application for development when the disturbed area of such development is more than one-half acre.
7.3.2 Activities Requiring a Grading Permit (rev. 12-16-10)
A. No person shall do any grading, stripping or otherwise disturb an area unless a valid grading permit is received from the Zoning Enforcement Officer. The following are the only exceptions:
a. agricultural use of land other than the creation of new pasture land;
b. an approved development where the disturbed area is cumulatively less than one-half acre;
c. a single family residence that is not part a subdivision.
B. Even though no grading permit is required for the activities in Section A above, such activities shall comply with the standards found in 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control as amended. Failure to comply with these standards shall be a violation of these regulations. (Rev. 4/23/05)
7.3.3 Grading Permit Application
A. For all activities requiring a grading permit, an application obtained from the Planning and Zoning Office shall be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer prior to beginning any activities. A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan shall accompany each application for a grading permit.
B. A soil erosion and sediment control plan shall contain proper provisions to adequately control accelerated erosion and sedimentation and to reduce the danger from storm water runoff on the proposed site. Such principles, methods and practices are found in the 2002 Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control as amended. Alternative principles, methods and practices may be used with prior approval of the
Zoning Enforcement Officer. The soil erosion and sediment control plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following information (rev. 4/23/05)
1. A narrative describing:
a. the development;
b. the schedule for grading and construction activities including: the start and completion dates; the sequence of grading and construction activities; the sequence for installation of soil erosion and sediment control measures; and the sequence for final stabilization of the project site;
c. the design criteria for proposed soil erosion and sediment control measures and storm water management facilities;
d. the construction details for proposed soil erosion and sediment control measures and storm water management facilities;
e. the installation and application procedures for proposed soil erosion and sediment control measures and storm water management facilities; and
f. the operations and maintenance program for proposed soil erosion and sediment control measures and storm water management facilities.
2. A site plan at a sufficient scale to show the following:
a. the location of the proposed development and adjacent properties;
b. the existing and proposed topography including soil types, wetlands, watercourses, and water bodies;
c. the existing structures on the site;
d. the proposed area alterations including cleared, excavated, filled or graded areas and proposed structures, utilities, roads and, if applicable, new property lines; and
e. the location of, and design details for, all proposed soil erosion and sediment control measures and storm water management facilities.
3. Any other information deemed necessary and appropriate by the applicant or required by the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
7.3.4 Review of Grading Permit Application
A. All grading permit applications shall be either approved, approved with conditions, or denied within thirty days of receipt of a complete application. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may refer the application to the Litchfield County Soil and Water Conservation Commission or other agency or consultant for their review and comment. As part of any approval, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall certify that the soil erosion and sediment control plan complies with these regulations. The thirty day review period may be extended an additional thirty days with the consent of the applicant. Failure to take action on the application within the allocated time period shall be deemed to be approval of the application as submitted.
B. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall deny the grading permit application unless the soil erosion and sediment control plan, as submitted, results in a development that:
1. minimizes erosion and sedimentation during construction;
2. is stabilized and protected from erosion when completed; and
3. does not cause off-site erosion and sedimentation.
C. If a grading permit application is denied, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall state on the record the reasons for the denial.
D. The decision of the Zoning Enforcement Officer may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
7.3.5 Conditions Relating to Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
A. As a condition of the approval of a grading permit, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall require a performance bond in the form of a certified check, pass book, irrevocable letter of credit or bond from a company licensed by the State of Connecticut. The performance bond shall be sufficient to cover the estimated total costs of all measures required to install and maintain the controls as shown on the approved soil erosion and sediment control plan.
B. Site development shall not begin unless the soil erosion and sediment control measures and facilities shall be installed as scheduled according to the approved soil erosion and sediment control plan.
C. All control measures and facilities shall be maintained in effective condition to ensure compliance with the approved plan.
7.3.6 Inspection and Enforcement
A. Inspections shall be made by the Zoning Enforcement Officer or during development to ensure compliance with the grading permit.
B. In the event of violation of this regulation the Zoning Enforcement Officer or Environmental Planner shall serve a Notice of Violation to the property owner or the owner's designated agent. Upon receipt of such notification the property owner shall have twenty four hours in which to cease and correct such violation and comply with the provisions of this regulation. If the violation is not corrected within the twenty four hour period, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall issue a Cease and Desist Order requiring the property owner to stop all work until the violations are corrected.
C. In the event of failure to complete the required work or failure to comply with a Cease and Desist Order, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may order such work as is necessary to eliminate any danger to persons or property and to leave the site in a safe condition. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may authorize completion of all necessary temporary or permanent soil erosion control measures. Funds to do the work shall come from the performance bond.
7.4 Stormwater Management
7.4.1 Purpose
A. The purpose of this section is to encourage development proposals to address drainage and stormwater issued related to new development and to incorporate Low Impact Development (LID) planning and design approaches in Torrington. This Section seeks to guide land use decisions and approaches in Torrington. The Section seeks to guide land use decisions and does not replace any Federal, State, or local stormwwater flow control and water quality treatment regulations.
B. Low Impact Development/Design (LID) is an approach to land use planning and project design that seeks to:
1. increase the ability of a developed site to effectively emulate pre-development hydrologic conditions, including without limitation, stormwater retention, water quality treatment, and infiltration functions;
2. Minimize overland stormwater runoff from a developed site;
3. Maximize the retention of trees, native vegetation, understory plants, and native soils;
4. Minimize soil disturbance;

8.2.1. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall decide on all applications for special exception. In granting or denying a special exception the Commission shall state upon the record the reasons for its decision.
8.2.2 Purpose
A. These Regulations are based upon the division of the City into zoning districts within which the use of land and structures are substantially uniform. The Commission, however, recognizes that certain uses and situations have unique characteristics. Because of their uniqueness, the Commission treats these uses and situations as Special Exceptions which allows the Commission to evaluate them on a case by case basis.
B. General Standards. (Rev. 8/2/99)
In deciding upon a Special Exception application, the Commission shall consider the following general standards; when applicable:
1. The Site Plan shall provide for a site design which is in harmony with the neighborhood, accomplishes a transition in character between areas of unlike character, protects property values, preserves and enhances the appearance and beauty of the community, and provides a harmonious relationship between existing and proposed buildings in the vicinity, specifically with regard to the visual relationship in terms of scale, proportions and particularly, the historic significance of the existing buildings.
130
2. Location. The location of the proposed Special Exception use is such that: the proximity of the proposed Special Exception use will not have a detrimental effect upon any church, school, library, playground, or similar facility found in Section 2.00 - 2.60 of the Table of Permitted Uses; and the number of similar existing Special Exception uses in the vicinity is such that the granting of the proposed Special Exception will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare.
3. Traffic. Vehicular and pedestrian traffic projected as a result of the use, vehicular and pedestrian traffic circulation; including traffic to and from and in the vicinity of the use, will not be hazardous or detrimental to the character of the zone or the neighborhood. In making its determination with respect to this criterion, the Commission shall consider the proposed location, the size and layout of the Special Exception use, its nature and the intensity of the operations involved, and its relation to the local streets providing access to the site and the adequacy of proposed traffic flow controls and emergency access. The Commission shall give due consideration to any recommendation by the City Engineer regarding the adequacy of any public road proposed to be used for access.
4. Parking. The Commission shall consider the impact of parking location, number of spaces and design on adjoining properties.
5. The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and height of harmony with adjacent properties and the neighbor- hood, will not hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or significantly impair the value thereof.
6. The proposed use shall not have a significant adverse effect upon property values or appearance in the neighborhood, taking into account the topography of the lot and the character, location and height of proposed buildings, structures and landscaping.
7. The Commission shall be satisfied that the applicant has shown the a. proposed methods for disposal of wastes and provision for volume and quality of water supply,
b. proposed measures for prevention of pollution of surface and ground water supplies and watersheds;
c. proposed measures for control of storm water run-off,
d. proposed methods to foster an energy efficient layout and landscaping plan,
e. Existing fire and police protection, transportation, water and sewer facilities, schools or other public facilities to meet the needs of the proposed use.
131
8. Provisions for signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic, safety, compatibility and harmony with adjacent properties and the neighborhood.
9. Provisions for open space and landscaping and other safeguards to be compatible with the adjacent property and the neighborhood in general.
10. The Commission shall be satisfied that the applicant has shown the adequacy of proposed measures for prevention of pollution of surface water supplies and drinking water supplies. The Commission shall consider the effect of the proposed activity on the quality and quantity of groundwater. The Commission may consider potential problems such as but not limited to:
a. Hazardous material and storage areas;
b. Existence of underground fuel storage facilities;
c. Location of floor drains;
11. Size, location and quality of run-off from parking lot areas;
12. Any other use that may adversely affect the quality or quantity of
groundwater. In consideration of the standards listed above, the Commission may attach such conditions in addition to those required elsewhere in these Regulations that it finds necessary. These may include but shall not be limited to, specifications for type of vegetation, specified provisions for sewage and storm water controls, for water supply for groundwater protection, landscaping and planting screens, periods of operation, sureties, deed restrictions, restrictive covenant, type of construction or any other reasonable conditions necessary to fulfill the purpose of this ordinance.
C. The Commission shall also consider the following factors in evaluating the
special exception application:
1. the proposals impact on land, structures and features having special historical, cultural or architectural features;
2. the architecture, height and size and location of any proposed buildings
and the buildings compatibility with the site and the surrounding neighborhood;
3. the proposals long term impact on the development of the surrounding neighborhood;
4. the capacity, safety, and condition of the surrounding streets to accommodate the traffic generated by the proposal;
5. the adequacy and condition of all public utilities that would serve the proposed use;
6. the proposals impact on the natural environment and the topography;
7. the proximity of schools, churches, public buildings, parks, and other places of public gatherings to the proposal; and
8. the impact the proposals site development including parking lots, storm water management, exterior lighting, landscaping, views, open space, signs would have on the surrounding properties.
132
The Commission may deny a special exception application based on any of the above factors.
8.2.3 In approving a special exception, the Commission may impose reasonable conditions to minimize any potential adverse impacts on surrounding properties, the historical, cultural or architectural features of the property or the surrounding properties, the natural environment, or the public welfare. Any violation of a condition is a violation of the regulations and is subject to the same enforcement measures.
8.2.4 In approving a special exception, the Commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or approve with modifications the development plan as submitted.
8.2.5 Any special exception which is not acted upon within two years of the date of approval shall be void. Upon written request of the applicant, the Commission may grant an extension of up to one additional year.
8.2.6 An applicant shall submit:
A. a formal special exception application on forms prescribed by the Commission;
B. plans with the same information as described for a site plan application in Section 8.4.3.
C. an up-to-date Class A-2 survey of the property and improvements prepared by a Land Surveyor registered in the State of Connecticut; and

ADDENDUM A. WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES
A.1.0 Statement of Purpose
This regulation establishes standards and requirements and permitting procedures for wireless communication facilities that are subject to local zoning regulation in Connecticut. Its purpose is to regulate the placement of antennas, towers, and other regulated wireless communication facilities to protect the health, safety and welfare of the City, and to provide for locations consistent with the Citys Plan of Development and the purposes of these Regulations, to minimize adverse visual effects through proper design, siting and screening, to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties, to provide for orderly removal of abandoned facilities.
A.2.0 Definitions
The following definitions shall apply solely to this Addendum:
Antenna - The surface from which wireless radio signals are sent and received by a personal wireless service facility.
Adequate Coverage - Coverage is considered to be adequate within that area surrounding a base station where the predicted or measured median field strength of the transmittal signal is greater than or equal to -95dbm for at least 75% of the intended coverage area. It is acceptable for there to be holes within the area of adequate coverage where the signal is less than -95dbm, as long as the signal regains its strength to greater than or equal to -95dbm further away from the base station. For the limited purpose of determining whether the use of a repeater is necessary or desirable, there shall be deemed not to be adequate coverage within said holes. The outer boundary of the area of adequate coverage, however, is that location past which the signal does not regain strength of greater than or equal to -95dbm.
Adequate Capacity. - Capacity is considered to be adequate if the Grade of Service (GOS) is p.05 or better for median traffic levels offered during the typical busy hours, as assessed by direct measurement of wireless communication facility in question. The GOS shall be determined by the use of standard Erlang B calculations. As call blocking may
occur in the land line or radio portions of a wireless network, adequate capacity shall apply only to the capacity of the wireless components.
Where capacity must be determined prior to the installation of the wireless communication facility in question, adequate capacity shall be determined on the basis of a 20% busy hour (20% of all offered traffic occurring within the busiest hour of the day), with total daily traffic based on aggregate estimates of the expected traffic in the coverage area.
Camouflaged - A wireless communication facility that is disguised, hidden, part of an existing or proposed structure, or placed within an existing or proposed structure is considered camouflaged.
Carrier - A company that provides wireless services.
Co-location - The use of a single mount on the ground by more than one carrier (vertical co-location) and/or several mounts on an existing building or structure by more than one carrier.
Elevation - The elevation at grade or ground level may be given in many ways, usually Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL). The height of a wireless service facility is often given in Above Ground Level (AGL). AGL is a measurement of height from the natural grade of a site to the highest point of a structure. The Total elevation of the wireless service facility is AGL plus AMSL.
Environmental Assessment (EA) - An EA is the document required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) when a wireless communication facility is placed in certain designated areas.
Equipment Shelter - An enclosed structure, cabinet, shed or box at the base of the mount within which are housed batteries and electrical equipment.
Fall Zone - The area on the ground within a prescribed radius from the base of a wireless communication facility. The fall zone is the area within which there is a potential hazard from falling debris (such as ice) or collapsing material.
Guyed Tower - A monopole or lattice tower that is tied to the ground or other surface by diagonal cables.
Lattice Tower - A type of mount that is self-supporting with multiple legs and cross-bracing of structural steel.
Licensed Carrier - A company authorized by the FCC to construct and operate a wireless communication facility.
Monopole Tower - The type of mount that is self-supporting with a single shaft of wood, steel, concrete or other material and platforms (or racks) for antennas arrayed at the top.
Mount - The structure or surface upon which antennas are mounted, including the following four types of mounts:
1. Roof-mounted. Mounted on the roof of a building.
2. Side-mounted. Mounted on the side of a building.
3. Ground-mounted Tower. Mounted on the ground.
4. Structure-mounted. Mounted on a structure other than a building.
Omnidirectional (whip) Antenna - A thin rod that transmits and receives a signal in all directions.
Panel Antenna - A flat surface antenna usually operated in multiples.
Radiofrequency Engineer (RF) - An engineer specializing in electrical or microwave engineering, especially the study of radio frequencies.
Radiofrequency Radiation (RFR) - The emissions from any device that propagates a wave form for the purpose of communication, including wireless communication facilities.
Regulated Facility, Service and/or Site - All facilities including mounts, towers and antennas and the site(s) these facilities are located on relating to personal communication services and any other wireless telecommunication service subject to local zoning regulation.
Security Barrier - A locked, impenetrable wall, fence or berm that completely seals an area from unauthorized entry or trespass.
Separation - The distance between one carriers array of antennas and another carriers array.

3. Special catch basin location and foundation drain connections: In special grade or high runoff situations, the City Engineer may require special setting of basins or multiple basins or may require additional storm drainage. Catch basins and subdrains may need to be added during construction pending ground conditions per the City Engineers directions. The storm drainage system shall be located to allow each property owner direct access to a storm drainage system without crossing under the road. Additional basins may be required at locations other than the conventional locations such as high points in roads to allow foundation drain connections. The street storm drainage system shall be designed to accommodate connection of all building foundation drains. Exceptions may be made where the topography allows foundation drains to daylight and discharge into a permanent natural area given the discharge point is at a sufficient distance to be determined by the City Engineer from abutting properties and that there are no potential erosion control and environmental concerns.

Sec. 1-9. EXCAVATION AND GRADING
A. General
All excavating and filling required for construction and improvements shall be as specified herein. The entire area of work shall be brought to the required lines and grades by excavation or filling. Excavation material, if suitable, may be used in making embankments and in filling low areas. A minimum of four (4) inches of topsoil shall be provided to cover over all disturbed areas. All streets shall be graded from property line to property line to approved grade and cross section. Roadway cross sections shall be as shown on City Standard Details.
B. Suitable Materials Required
No stumps, wood, roots, sod or other fibrous materials shall be placed in any embankment. In those locations where the alignment crosses swamp or marsh land, or other similar soil that is incapable of supporting the proposed roads, such inadequate soil shall be entirely removed and replaced with an approved adequate material. The materials so removed shall not be places in embankment, but may be used in flattening embankment slopes or for filling low spots outside the road section. The City Engineer may require the subdivider to submit evidence of borings and/or other soil investigations to determine the depth composition and stability of the subgrade within the road section.
C. Embankments
Embankments shall be formed of suitable and acceptable excavated materials and brought to the required lines and grades. The materials for embankment shall be placed in successive horizontal layers not exceeding six (6) inches in depth extending across the entire fill area. They shall be spread by a bulldozer or other acceptable method, and shall be thoroughly compacted. Successive layers shall not be placed until the layer under construction has been thoroughly compacted. Where embankments are made of rock, the rock shall be so deposited that all voids are filled with earth and in such a way that the compaction specified above may be secured.
D. Subgrade
Upon completion of filling and excavating, the subgrade shall be formed to the required grade and contour, and the entire surface again rolled as specified above. High spots shall be removed and low spots filled with the acceptable material and the process of leveling and rolling continued until not further depression results. Soft spots shall be removed and replaced with crushed stone, gravel or as specified by the City Engineer. These areas shall be drained as directed by the City Engineer.
E. Side Slopes
Side slopes in embankment and on roadside drainage ditches shall be as shown on the City Standard Details. Side slopes shall not be graded so as to extend beyond the limits of the road right-of-way onto land not part of the subdivision unless a suitable slope easement has been properly established and granted by the affected property owner.
31
Sec. 1-10. SITE PRESERVATION
A. Natural Cover
Residential developments shall be subdivided and improved in reasonable conformity to existing topography in order to minimize grading, cut and fill, and to retain, insofar as possible, the natural contours, limit storm water runoff, and conserve the natural cover and soil. Land areas with topography exceeding twenty (20%) percent slopes shall remain undisturbed in its natural state. No topsoil, sand or gravel shall be removed from a residential subdivision for any other purpose than to meet construction needs for that particular subdivision or to meet any requirements of these Regulations.
B. Erosion and Sediment Control
The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one time during development. When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be kept to the shortest practical period of time. Land should not be left exposed during the winter months. Where necessary, temporary vegetation and/or mulching and structural measures may be required by the Zoning Enforcement Officer to protect areas exposed during the development. Sediment basins (debris basins, de-silting basins, settling basins, or silt traps) shall be installed and maintained during development to remove sediment from runoff water and from land undergoing development. The 2002 Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection E&S Guidelines shall be followed as amended.
C. Other Requirements
Where possible, natural drainage-ways may be utilized and left open to remove excess surface water; the permanent final vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as practical in the subdivision. If the City Engineer determines that excessive damage may result from open channel flow, armored or closed drainage systems will be required.
Sec. 1-11. FIRE PROTECTION
In the event that a subdivision is not serviced by public water mains, then the following standards shall apply in order to provide minimum requirements for water supply for firefighting, and a reasonable degree of protection to life and property.
A. There shall be located in the subdivision a water storage facility capable of delivering required fire flows as determined by using the ISO formula for required fire flow. Such storage and delivery systems will meet the requirements of NFPA #22, Water Tanks for Private Fire Protection, and NFPA #24, Private Fire Service Mains and Their Appurtenances. In no case shall storage capacity be less than 10,000 gallons of usable water. The water storage facility shall be under joint ownership of the lots it serves. The owners of lots for which the water storage facility was installed for shall equally share in the maintenance costs of the water storage facility. The water storage facility shall never be accepted or maintained by the City of Torrington. Applicants shall provide the Commission with copies of proposed deeds or covenants that shall identify water storage facility ownership and maintenance responsibilities. The Commission shall be assured that the ownership, responsibility for maintenance, improvements and liability associated with the water storage facility shall remain private. The deed or covenant shall be submitted for review and acceptance of the Citys Corporation Counsel. The approved deed or covenant shall be filed in the City Clerks office along with the final subdivision map.
32
B. If proper improvements to be constructed are to be sprinklered, either by Building Code requirements or applicants choice, water storage capacity shall be determined by NFPA #13, Installation of Sprinkler Systems (for commercial and/or multifamily), or NFPA #13D, Installation of Sprinkler Systems in One and Two-Family Dwellings. In the event that the proposed project does not fit within either national code, then the Fire Department shall determine what is required to meet the intent of these two codes.
C. The supply of water for firefighting purposes shall be located and maintained so as to be accessible year-round to Fire Department apparatus. Such supply shall be within a 1,000 feet hose lay of all structures for residential development and within 500 feet hose lay of all structures for commercial and industrial development. The public water line may need to be extended as determined by the Fire Department Chief.
D. The Fire Department shall provide additional review comments as to compliance with these standards.
Nothing contained herein shall relieve the subdivider of complying with applicable provisions of the Building Code.
Sec. 1-12. PEDESTRIAN WALKS AND BICYCLE PATHS
Where necessary, in the judgment of the Planning & Zoning Commission, rights of way for pedestrian and/or bicycle travel and access may be required between subdivisions or its parts or between a subdivision and public property. These pedestrian walks and/or bicycle paths shall be built in conformity with applicable standards of the City.
Sec. 1-13. DEVELOPEMNT OF ACTIVE RECREATION
On land to be used as active recreation open space, undesirable growth and debris shall be removed. Wooded and brook areas shall be left natural. Active recreation open spaces shall be cleared and graded properly to dispose of surface water, and shall be seeded with lawn grass. There shall be no depositing, dumping, or storage of waste, or other natural or man-made material, supplies or equipment, on any subdivision land designated as open space. No work, or removal, or filling shall be done, nor shall the existing natural characteristics of open space land be altered from the original condition, until a subdivision plan shall have been approved.
Sec. 1-14. PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS
Areas set aside for parks and playgrounds to be dedicated or to be reserved for the common use of all property owners in the subdivision whether or not required by the Planning & Zoning Commission shall be of reasonable size, shape, character and location for the intended use. See Section 1.13 for clearing and preparation of the site.
33
Sec. 1-15. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
A. Policy
1. Maintain, where feasible, the natural environment of City streams and drainage systems by the control of pollutants from storm runoff from entering the systems and through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development and, where feasible, restore the floodplain to its natural functional purpose.
2. Encourage innovative design solutions to control the quality of storm runoff from development sites during and after construction. Natural landscape solutions such as minimization of impervious surfaces, undisturbed buffers, and filter strips are preferred over structural solutions such as detention ponds.
3. Encourage the construction of joint detention ponds serving several properties.
4. Areas adjacent to the Naugatuck River may not require storm water detention. It must be shown that the existing drainage system to the river has sufficient capacity to carry any additional runoff generated from the proposed development.
5. The 2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual as amended provides guidance in the preparation of a stormwater management plan.
B. Storm Water Management Report Required
1. A Storm Water Management Report prepared by a State of Connecticut Licensed Professional Engineer shall be provided for every project. The purpose of this report shall be to formulate a plan to manage storm water runoff so that storm water runoff hazards are not created and existing runoff-related problems are not exacerbated, either upstream or downstream from or within the boundaries of the property being developed. The report, if applicable, shall include hydraulic analysis and detention pond hydraulics, pipe and open channel hydraulics, culvert hydraulics and water quality best management practices.
2. The Storm Water Management Report shall identify the locations and quantities of storm water runoff entering and exiting the site for both pre- and post-developed conditions. Analysis of the off-site properties shall anticipate future development in addition to addressing existing conditions.
All culverts, pipe systems, and open channel flow systems shall be sized based on all on-site upstream areas being developed in accordance with the development plans and the off-site upstream areas being fully developed in accordance with the land use for the associated planning zone with no detention. Upstream detention may be included when determining flows, provided the engineer calculates the reduced flows by routing the developed flows through any storm water facility included in the analysis rather than assuming the reduction will occur. The engineer shall show that detention facilities used in the analysis will remain, be properly maintained and the storage volume and outlet structure is based on current as-built conditions.
34
Detention facilities shall be designed using pre-development flows based on existing conditions for all upstream areas. Post-development flows, except the 100-year flow, shall be based on on-site upstream areas being developed per the development plans and existing conditions for off-site upstream areas.
The 100-year flow shall be based on on-site upstream areas being developed per the development plans and the off-site upstream areas being developed per the land use for the associated planning zone with no detention. Upstream detention may be included if it meets the conditions as described for culverts and pipe systems. Existing conditions shall be defined as the conditions of the site at the time of application for a land disturbance permit. The existing condition includes on-site lakes and ponds. Pre-development flows shall be determined by routing the pre-development flows through these storm water facilities.
The report shall contain drainage area delineation maps and other exhibits at satisfactory scale and sufficient in quantity and scope to define the boundaries of the site, and off-site areas, relative to water courses, intermittent and perennial, drainage divides, drainage structures, and other pertinent features.
3. For the purposes of these regulations, the words downstream and analysis shall have the following meanings. The analysis of downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every point or area along the project sites boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainage way immediately downstream from the project. This area shall extend downstream from the project to a point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten (10%) percent of the total basin area.
a. The report shall examine the conditions downstream from the project to a point where the project area is ten (10) percent of the total drainage basin.
(i) The analysis shall include all culverts, obstructions, existing and potential erosion problems, and elevations of existing improvements, existing drainage complaints and any other existing modifications to natural conditions. The downstream water courses and receiving conveyance shall be analyzed to ensure that the channel velocities do not exceed values recommended for the existing natural channel lining.
(ii) If there are any problems identified downstream that are a result of the development, then the developer shall eliminate the conditions causing the problem.
b. Hydrographs shall be analyzed at least at two points. One study point shall be at the downstream property line where the watercourse crosses the project sites downstream property line. The second study point shall be downstream of the project at the point where the project area is ten (10) percent of the total drainage basin.
(i) The study will compare pre-developed hydrographs with post-developed hydrographs for the 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100-year flood frequencies; and,
(ii) Comparison of peak flows shall include the timing of hydrographs; and,
(iii) Hydrographs shall be based on a 24 hour storm.
35
4. The following criteria shall be evaluated by the applicants engineer preparing the Storm Water Management Report and in determining whether or not detention should be required for any portion of any site:
a. Existing land uses downstream;
b. Anticipated future land uses downstream;
c. Magnitude of increase in peak flows due to development;
d. Presence of existing drainage problems;
e. Capacity of existing and anticipated drainage systems;
f. Creation of concentrated flows where none had occurred previously;
g. Availability of feasible locations for detention facilities;
h. Existing flows generated off-site which pass through the project site; and,
i. The nature of the receiving watercourse.
5. When a proposed development uses an existing storm water management facility, the City Engineer may require a new record survey, drawing, new storm water management report and certification showing that the facility meets the current City storm water management requirements.
C. Storm Water Detention Required
1. Whenever a Storm Water Management Report indicates that an adverse impact from storm water runoff is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be provided with storm water detention facilities. The meaning of adverse impact shall apply when pre-development flows did not cause difficulties and post-development flows do. Difficulties shall include but not be limited to situations where 25-year velocities exceed the non-erosive velocity of the stream or drainage channel, habitable structures are shown to be subject to increased depth of flooding for any frequency up to and including the regulatory flood, and storm water facilities that can not carry the design storm in accordance with these regulations.
2. The City Engineer may elect to waive the storm water detention facilities requirement if the applicants engineer certifies and provides certified documentation supporting the conclusion to the City Engineer that at least one of the following is true and correct as applicable:
a. The non-detained, post-development runoff shall not produce concentrated flows and shall leave the project site as sheet flow, and shall not have an adverse impact upon downstream properties.
b. The effect of detention concentrates flows where sheet flow had occurred under pre-developed conditions. The impact of increased sheet flows upon downstream properties would be less adverse than that which would result from the concentrated flows from a detention facility even if energy dissipation devices such as level spreaders were employed.
c. The undetained flow will pass through downstream properties, in drainage easements obtained by the developer, to an existing detention facility which has been designed to manage the upstream propertys runoff or to the point in the downstream analysis which shows that detention is not required.
d. Where the site runoff will flow directly into the Naugatuck River without crossing off-site properties. Water quality treatment shall be provided onsite.
36
3. Should the applicants engineer conclude that storm water detention may not be necessary because of anticipated compliance with Section 1-15.C.2, rigid compliance with all of the following criteria is mandatory:
a. A storm water management report shall always be required whether or not storm water detention is required.
b. If the applicant proposes to show that the detention requirement may be eliminated for all or a portion of a project, then a pre-submittal conference with the City Engineers staff is required prior to preparation and submittal of construction plans for the project. The consultant shall be prepared to discuss the downstream analysis findings. If the existing downstream conditions are overburdened by the pre-developed flows, then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to eliminate the downstream overburdened conditions at his or her expense when the development occurs and if there are any existing drainage complaints downstream, then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to minimize the conditions causing the complaint at his or her expense when the development occurs.
D. Detention Design Criteria  General
1. All storm water detention facilities shall be designed to detain the first ½ of runoff from all roads and parking areas in the area draining to the detention pond. In addition, these facilities shall control the peak flow rates associated with storms having 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 25-year return frequencies so that flows from the developed site do not exceed those associated with pre-development conditions at the project boundary nor increase the peak flows downstream from the project to the point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten (10%) percent of the total basin. Where adverse impacts, as defined in Section 1-15.C.1, occur during the 50 and 100-year storms, the 50 and 100-year storms shall also be regulated.
2. A variety of methods of achieving storm water management goals shall be acceptable in providing detention facilities. The type of facility provided shall be based on the following criteria:
a. The type of development which the detention facility is being provided;
b. The type of development which the detention facility is intended to protect;
c. Volume of storm water to be stored;
d. Origin and magnitude of the flows to be managed;
e. Topographic opportunities and limitations;
f. Safety considerations;
g. Maintenance requirements;
h. Aesthetic considerations;
i. Likelihood of facility operation interfering with access to public or private facilities;
j. Proximity of facility to property lines, utilities, buffers, etc.; and,
k. Similar site-specific constraints.
3. Detention facilities shall be in a normally dry basin.
4. Reservoir routing methods shall be used for all detention facility design. The size of the orifice to detain the 1-year storm for the facility shall be computed using the following orifice equation with a 24 hour draw down time from the elevation of the total channel protection volume (CPV) and an orifice coefficient of 0.60. The minimum elevation of
37
the 2-year control shall be at the maximum routed pool elevation of the 1-year storm and not pool elevation of the total 1-year storm volume.
h = head measured in feet from the elevation needed to store the total 1-year runoff volume (CPV) to the centroid of the orifice;
Qa = average CPV outflow rate in cfs;
Qa = CPV/(3600 x 24);
A = required orifice area in square feet;
A = Qa/(0.6 x (64.4 x h/2) 0.5).
5. The design of every detention facility of any type shall consider the effects both of inflows in excess of those the facility is designed to accommodate and of malfunctioning of the primary outlet system. A safe path for overflow condition flows shall be provided. An emergency spillway type overflow shall be located in existing cut areas and not in fill embankments.
6. Weirs shaped like a V (V notch weirs) shall be used where practical, considering structural or hydrological concerns.
7. The basin perimeter may not be a wall of any type.
E. Detention Facility Location Criteria
1. Detention facilities may be constructed within open space or recreation areas if the following criteria are met:
a. Ownership of the area will be held by a Property Owners Association, Homeowners Association, or other acceptable third party such as Heritage Land Preservation Trust. Funding for the perpetual maintenance of the detention facility shall be provided by the developer to the entity assuming future maintenance responsibilities. The initial amount of funds shall be approved by the City Engineer.
b. Detention facilities within recreation areas will be approved only if the design of the area includes recreation amenities such as ball fields, tennis courts, grassed open areas or other similar improvements. The intent is to provide recreation facilities with detention as a secondary feature. The detention features shall not interfere with the intended used of the recreation amenity, (i.e., a large swale shall not traverse a ball field, etc.).
2. If a residential subdivision is provided with an on-site detention facility not located within a recreation area as specified above, a mandatory property owners association shall be established for its ownership and maintenance. The facility shall be located on land within the development and owned by the property owners association. The lot shall have a minimum of thirty (30) feet of public road frontage and a minimum lot width of thirty (30) feet. If the project is provided with an off-site detention facility, a mandatory property owners association shall be established for its maintenance. The association bylaws shall be recorded concurrently with the recording of a final subdivision map.
The association bylaws shall include the following provisions:
a. Automatic (mandatory) membership of all purchasers of lots therein and their successors; and,
38
b. Conditions and timing of transferring control of the association from the developer to the lot owners shall be specified which shall not exceed four (4) years from the date of recording of the subdivision map; and
c. Responsibility for maintenance, insurance and taxes; and
d. Sharing of the costs of maintenance among the lot owners with shares defined by the association bylaws; and
e. Authority to place liens on the real property of members who fail to pay their dues or assessments; and

e. A drive to the bottom of the detention pond shall be provided when the facility is over ten (10) feet deep from the bench elevation or the facility is wider than fifty (50) feet as measured from bench to bench.
G. Detention Facility Maintenance
1. The detention storage capacity or function of any detention basin, pond or other impoundment, whether natural or man-made, shall not be removed or diminished without the express approval of the City Engineer.
2. It shall be the responsibility of the mandatory property owners association or property owner in the case of non-residential project to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for storm water detention and to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris.
H. Detention Facility Construction Standards
1. Storm water detention facilities shall be constructed in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the Engineering Department, and shall be in place and inspected prior to the initiation of other improvements.
2. The side slope in graded areas shall be 3H:1V or flatter. The normal ponding surface elevation shall be defined as the elevation when the volume contained in the facility equals the runoff from a 1.2 rainfall event. When the depth to the normal ponding surface is greater than four (4) feet and the side slope is steeper than 4H:1V, a bench shall be provided. The bench shall be at least ten (10) feet in width and is recommended to be fifteen (15) feet in width. The slope of the bench shall be 10H:1V. The bench shall be located so that the normal ponding surface elevation is between the top and bottom edge of the bench.
3. The bottom of the pond shall be graded for positive drainage.
39
I. Detention Facility Certification and Record Drawings
1. When a new facility is constructed in a development, a certified record survey of each detention facility shall be prepared by a land surveyor currently registered in the State of Connecticut. A certified detailed record drawing of the facility shall be prepared based upon this survey. The project engineer shall submit the following certification prior to any issuance of Certificate of Occupancy unless waived by the City Engineer.
I, ________________, a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Connecticut, hereby certify with my signature and seal, that the existing detention facility (facilities) for the project known as ___________________, for owner/developer ______________________, lying in the City of Torrington, Litchfield County, Connecticut has been constructed in conformance with the permitted plans and specifications, that the actual stage-storage relationships will not produce discharge rates greater than those stated in the accepted hydrology report for the respective storm events, and that the pond functions as designed. I further certify that downstream, off-site property(ies) are not receiving discharges at erosive velocities or at velocities greater than the pre-developed rates, whichever is less or receiving concentrated flow in other than defined drainage ditches or creeks.
The survey shall be performed after substantial completion and stabilization of the project has occurred. The record drawing and addendum to the Storm Water Management Report shall be submitted to the City.

Sec. 4-6. REPAIR OF EXISTING GEOFABRIC AND UNDERDRAINS
A. Geofabric Material
1. If an excavation cuts through an area that has been constructed with geofabrics, the following restoration procedures shall be strictly adhered to:
a. Use a fabric replacement piece that has similar properties as that of the cut fabric. The most important property is that of the 095 Sieve Test or that property of the fabric, which has an opening, mesh size which allows five (5) percent of glass beads to pass through when sieved (ASTM D4751-87).
b. Over-cut the trench walls by a minimum of six (6) inches in the area of the fabric replacement being careful not to disturb the existing six (6) inch width of fabric exposed. Place a minimum of a six (6) inches overlap of new fabric. Do not allow soil migration in this seam area. Increase the seam width if the sub-grade is very soft. If soft sub-grade and trench lie directly beneath a wheel path, increase the seam width to twelve (12) inches.
c. Sew or staple the seams in accordance with manufacturer recommendation. If sewn, use colored thread, do not sew near the edge, double sew at 10 - 15 stitches per inch, and use thread material that closely matches fabric properties. If stapled or pinned, pin on two (2) feet centers; use 6"x 1" wide staples which can be applied by foot activated guns.
d. Caution must be exercised when placing and compacting the first twelve (12) inches of material so as not to puncture the fabric.

Section 1
Title and Authority
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the City of Torrington."
1.3 The Inland Wetlands Commission of the City of Torrington was established in accordance with an ordinance adopted June 12, 1978, effective on July 16, 1978 and shall implement the purposes and provisions of these regulations and the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act in the City of Torrington.
1.4 These regulations have been adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and these regulations.
1.5 The Agency shall enforce the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and shall issue, with terms, conditions, limitations or modifications, or deny permits for all regulated activities in the City of Torrington pursuant to sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended.

10.2 Criteria for Decision. In carrying out the purposes and policies of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, including matters relating to regulating, licensing and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the Agency shall take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. the environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses;
b. the applicants purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses.
c. the relationship between the short term and long term impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of such wetlands or watercourses.
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such activity would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity including, but not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (3) in the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources;
e. the character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health or the reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened by the proposed regulated activity; and

The inland wetlands agency shall immediately reverse such permit approval if the commissioner of the state agency that hold such restriction satisfies that the land use authorized in such permit violates the terms of such conservation or preservation restriction.
10.10 Nothing in subsections 7.11c or 7.11d of these regulations shall be construed to prohibit the filing of a permit application or to require such written notice when the activity that is the subject of such permit application will occur on a portion of property that is not restricted under the terms of such conservation or preservation restriction.

a. The activity applied for would clearly result in a substantial public benefit to the environment or to the public health and safety and the applicant would reasonably be deterred from initiating the activity solely or primarily as a result of the amount of the application fee, or
b. The amount of the application fee is clearly excessive in relation to the cost to the city for reviewing and processing the application.
c. The applicant has shown good cause.
The Agency shall state upon its record the basis for all actions under this subsection.
19.8 Fees as Minimum; Additional Fees; Consultants: (added 8/19/08)
a. The fees set forth in subsection 19.5 are the minimum application fees required. When the actual cost of processing an application exceeds the minimum application fee due to the need for outside consulting services, the Inland Wetlands Commission shall charge the applicant a surcharge fee to fund the approximate actual costs of processing the application.
b. The expenses for such outside consultants may be estimated by the Commission upon review of the application, based on the projected expenses of reviewing, evaluating and processing the application. This reasonable estimate, together with the appropriate application fee given above, shall be paid forthwith, and the application shall be deemed incomplete until these fees have been submitted and cleared.
c. For the purpose of this section, an outside consultant means a qualified professional who is not an employee of the City, including but not limited to an engineer, wetland biologist, soils scientist, environmental impact consultant, and/or wildlife habitat expert.
d. Any portion of the surcharge fee not expended by the city on the project review shall be rebated to the applicant upon completion of the review, evaluation and processing of the application.
e. The Commission shall bill the applicant for any costs incurred by the city in excess of the surcharge fee paid by the applicant. This bill shall be paid by the applicant prior to the issuance of any wetland permit or permit to construct.
