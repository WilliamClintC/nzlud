In recognition of those goals, there is hereby established a Code of Ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The purpose of this code is to establish ethical standards by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city.
(b) Responsibilities of Public Office - Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this State and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state, and city and thus to foster respect for all government.

and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by officially recognized confidentiality of their work.

(2) Use of Public Property. No official or employee shall request or permit the use of city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided as city policy for the use of such official or employee in the conduct of official business.
(3) Obligations to Citizens. No official or employee shall grant any special consideration, treatment, or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every other citizen.
(e) Conflict of Interest. No elected or appointive city official or employee, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or transaction or shall have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her duties in the public interest or would tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties.

Specific conflicts of interest are enumerated below for the guidance of officials and employees:
(1) Incompatible Employment - No elected or appointive city official or employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render services for private interests when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or would tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties.

The prohibition against gifts or favors shall not apply to: (a) an occasional non-pecuniary gift, of only nominal value or (b) an award publicly presented in recognition of public service or (c) any gift which would have been offered or given to him or her if not an official or employee.
(4) Representing Private Interest before City Agencies or Courts - No elected or appointive city official or employee whose salary is paid in whole or in part by the city shall appear on behalf of any private interest before any agency of this city.

HEARING PROCEDURES. (a) Owners or persons entitled to the lawful custody of impounded vehicles who wish to contest the validity of the vehicle tow may request a hearing for such purpose by notifying the Park City Municipal Court Clerk of the request in writing. The request shall state the grounds upon which the person requesting the hearing believes the impoundment invalid or unjustified. Absent exigent circumstances, such request must be made no later than five business days from impoundment of the vehicle or receipt of the notice of impoundment, whichever is later. (b) A hearing for the purpose of determining the validity of the tow shall be held by the municipal court within seven days of receipt of proper request filed pursuant to this section, except where a vehicle has not yet been released from impoundment, in which case the court will set and conduct the hearing within three working days after such hearing is requested. The times of the hearing shall be set by the Clerk of the Municipal Court. (c) Pending such hearing, the owner or person lawfully entitled to custody of any impounded vehicle may retrieve the impounded vehicle upon payment of an amount equal to the towing and storage charges incurred by the vehicle. If such payment is made, the vehicle will be released immediately upon proof of entitlement thereof.

Any person who fails to appear at the hearing without good cause will not be entitled to have such hearing rescheduled. (e) If, after hearing, the court determines that there was no factual basis for the impoundment of said vehicle, then the vehicle will be released to the owner or person lawfully entitled to custody thereof without costs, and any amount previously paid by such person for towing and storage charges will be returned to them by the wrecker service operator. If after hearing it is determined that the vehicle was lawfully towed, and towing and storage charges have been previously paid by the owner or person having lawful custody of the vehicle, then such payment may be retained by the wrecker service operator. (f) If any owner or person lawfully entitled to custody of any impounded vehicle makes an advance payment of all towing and storage costs but does not appear at the designated time for hearing, such payment shall be forfeited to the wrecker service operator. (g) Owners of vehicles which are stolen and impounded under the provisions of this title shall be responsible for payment of any charges in connection with towing or storage of any stolen vehicle. (h) An appeal from an order of a municipal court judge made pursuant to this section of the code shall be directed to the Eighteen Judicial District Court of the State of Kansas pursuant to K.S.A. 60-2101(d) and amendments thereto.

City of Park City Municipal Code 15-25 Chapter 15 - Utilities
Building Sewer that does not allow Sewage to flow freely from the Building Drain to the Public Sewer. Examples, without limitation, of conditions that prevent the free flow of Sewage are as follows: broken pipes, improper taps to Public Sewer, failure to properly clean out a Building Sewer, etc. A Building Sewer that is maintained in a manner that does not allow the free flow of Sewage from the Building Drain to the Public Sewer constitutes a public nuisance.
(p) The Utility Supervisor may provide, by certified mail, written notice to the owners of property where Sewage does not flow freely through the Building Sewer.
(q) The Utility Supervisor shall, in such written notice, inform the Person receiving the notice that he/she has ten (10) days from the date of receipt of the notice to abate the condition that is preventing the free flow of Sewage through the Building Sewer or to request a hearing before the Governing Body. The Utility Supervisor may cause the Building Sewer to be repaired if the owner of the property does not repair the line or request a hearing within ten (10) days of being served the notice from the Utility Supervisor. Failure on the part of the owner to make a timely request for a hearing shall constitute a waiver of the owner’s right to contest the findings of the Utility Supervisor before the Governing Body. If a hearing is held, it shall be held by the Governing Body as soon as possible after the filing of a request for hearing. At any such hearing, the owner may be represented by counsel, and the owner and the City may introduce such witnesses and evidence as is deemed necessary and proper by the Governing Body. The hearing need not be conducted according to the formal rules of evidence. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the Governing Body shall record its determination of the matter by means of adopting a resolution and serving the resolution upon the owner by certified mail.

The solid waste utility, under the direction of the city administrator or his/her designee, shall have the power to:

For substantial improvements, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
State Coordinating Agency means the Division of Water Resources, Kansas Department of Agriculture, or other office designated by the governor of the state or by state statute at the request of the Administrator to assist in the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in that state.
Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, which is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. “Structure” for insurance purposes, means a walled and roofed building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home on a permanent foundation. For the latter purpose, the term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration or repair, but does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in such construction, alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises.
Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial Damage includes Repetitive Loss buildings (see “Repetitive Loss”).
Substantial Improvements means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
City of Park City Municipal Code 17-8 Chapter 17 – Flood Plain Management
conditions, or (2) any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a “historic structure.”
Temporary Structure means a structure permitted in a district for a period not to exceed 180 days and is required to be removed upon the expiration of the permit period. Temporary structures may include recreational vehicles, temporary construction offices, or temporary business facilities used until permanent facilities can be constructed, but at no time shall it include manufactured homes used as residences.
Variance means a grant of relief by the community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. Flood insurance requirements remain in place for any varied use or structure and cannot be varied by the community.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Water Surface Elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplain.

ARTICLE 2. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSES
17-201. APPROVAL OF CHIEF ENGINEER.
The following floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved in draft form by the Chief Engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture on January 3, 2007.
17-202. KANSAS STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
The Legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et seq, and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare.
17-203. FINDINGS OF FACT.
(a) The special flood hazard areas of the City of Park City, Kansas, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b) These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(c) The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this ordinance uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series of interrelated steps.
(1) Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is representative of large floods, which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated February 2, 2007 as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
(2) Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over-bank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
(3) Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
City of Park City Municipal Code 17-10 Chapter 17 – Flood Plain Management
(4) Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height.
(5) Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood.
17-204. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described hereinabove; to establish or maintain the community’s eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this ordinance to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
(3) Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

ARTICLE 3 GENERAL PROVISIONS
17-301. LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
This Chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Park City identified as numbered and unnumbered A, AE, and AH Zones, on the Index Map dated February 2, 2007 of the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and the Index Map dated February 2, 2007 of the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this Chapter, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the Park City, City Council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the Park City, City Council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in Article 4.
17-302. COMPLIANCE.
No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and other applicable regulations.
17-303. ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this Chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
17-304. INTERPRETATION.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by Kansas statutes.
17-305. WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This Chapter shall not create a liability on the part of Park City, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.

17-605. CONDITIONS FOR APPROVING FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT VARIANCES.
(a) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvement to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items two (2) through six (6) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(b) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination, provide the proposed activity will not preclude the structure’s continued historic designation.
(c) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any significant increase in flood discharge would result.
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(e) Variances shall only be issued upon: (1) showing of good and sufficient cause, (2) determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (3) determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(f) A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this Chapter.
City of Park City Municipal Code 17-23 Chapter 17 – Flood Plain Management
17-606. CONDITIONS FOR APPROVING VARIANCES FOR AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURES.
Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth herein.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-flood proofed:
(a) All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the floodplain management regulations of this Chapter shall demonstrate that the varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the agricultural structure. Residential structures, such as farmhouses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
(b) Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural purposes in Zone A, AE and AH only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
(c) For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with the requirements of Article 4.
(d) The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with the requirements of Article 4. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
(e) Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation or flood proofed so that they are contained within a watertight, flood proofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.
(f) The agricultural structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the one percent annual chance flood event, also referred to as the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.
(g) The agricultural structures must comply with the flood-plain management floodway encroachment provisions of Article 4. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures within any designated floodway, if any increase in flood levels
City of Park City Municipal Code 17-24 Chapter 17 – Flood Plain Management
would result during the one percent annual chance flood event, also referred to as the 100-year flood.
(h) Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
(i) No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the agricultural structures.
(j) A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this Chapter.

These regulations are intended to serve the following purposes:
A. To promote the public health, safety, morals, comfort and general welfare;

D. To regulate and restrict the height, number of stories and size of buildings and structures including their distance from any street or highway; the percentage of each lot that may be occupied by buildings and other structures; and size of yards, courts and other open spaces;
E. To protect property values and conserve energy and natural resources;
F. To provide for adequate light and air and acceptable noise levels;
G. To avoid the undue concentration of population and vehicular traffic and to prevent overcrowding the use of land and public facilities;

ARTICLE 2. INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS
100 Rules of Interpretation
A. Minimum Requirements. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, comfort and general welfare.
B. Overlapping or Contradictory Regulations. Where the conditions imposed by the provisions of these regulations upon the use of land or structures are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of any other applicable law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive and impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
C. Private Agreements. The provisions of these regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, deed restriction, covenant or other private agreement of legal relationship; provided, that where the requirements of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such private agreements, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.

The term shall include two or more separately towed units which are designed to be bolted or otherwise fastened together to form a complete living unit. Such homes are built on a chassis consisting of drawbar and coupling mechanism, frame (e.g., steel I-beams), running gear assembly and lights. Removal of any or all of these component parts does not change the definition. All such homes shall be either skirted according to the manufacturer's design and construction standards or placed on a permanent-type, enclosed perimeter foundation and, according to standards of the State of Kansas under K.S.A. 75-1226, et seq., as amended, shall be anchored to the ground or secured to a permanent-type foundation. Additions may be made to such homes for patios, porches, carports, garages, storage structures and living space provided such additions are designed and constructed by a manufactured home factory or meet applicable City building codes. Overhead structures which cover or enclose a home are not permitted; however, a protective roof covering which is used to remedy a deteriorating roof condition is permitted. Under no circumstances shall two or more single-wide homes be permitted to connect together in any manner on the same zoning lot, nor shall such homes be attached to or integrated with the design of a site-built dwelling unit. (See MANUFACTURED HOME and RESIDENTIAL-DESIGN MANUFACTURED HOME.)
MODULAR HOME: A single family or duplex dwelling structure located on a permanent foundation and connected to public utilities, consisting of pre-selected, prefabricated units or modules, and transported to and/or assembled on the site of its foundation; in contradistinction to a dwelling structure which is custom built on the site of its permanent location; and also in contradistinction to a manufactured home, either single-width, double-width or multi-width, located on its permanent foundation. In general, such modular homes shall have exterior building materials that are somewhat similar in appearance to custom built single-family dwellings and meet the standards of the City building codes.
NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD: A zoning lot which does not comply with the lot size requirements for any permitted use in the district in which it is located. (See Sections 8-100A and 101 for Nonconforming Lots of Record.)
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE OR USE: A lawfully existing structure or use at the time these regulations or any amendments thereto became effective which does not conform to the requirements of the zone in which it is located. (See Sections 8-100B, C, 102 and 103 for Nonconforming Structures and Uses.)
NURSING OR CONVALESCENT HOME: An institution for the care of children or the aged or infirm, or a place of rest for those suffering bodily disorders, but not including institutions for the care and treatment of mental illness, alcoholism or narcotics addiction.

ARTICLE 3. GENERAL PROVISIONS
100 Activities Governed by these Regulations.
A. New Structures. All structures built hereafter shall comply with all of the provisions of these regulations. Any structure hereafter moved from one site to another site shall be considered to be a structure built hereafter. Any structure rebuilt or restored after damage, by any means, shall be considered to be a structure built hereafter, unless Article 8 of these regulations permits such structures to be rebuilt or restored. (See Section 2-102 for definition of STRUCTURE.)
B. New Uses of Old Structures. If a use of any structure is hereafter changed to another, then the new use must comply with the use regulations of these regulations, unless permitted by provisions in Article 8. The mere establishment of the new use does not require an existing structure to conform to the lot size requirements or the bulk regulations.
C. Structural Alterations. If any structure is hereafter structurally altered as defined in Section 2-102:
1. The entire structure as altered shall comply with the use regulations of these regulations.
2. Any alterations, enlargements or additions to the structure shall comply with the bulk regulations of these regulations, except as permitted by Section 8-102B for nonconforming structures.
3. The off-street parking facilities shall not be reduced below or if already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements applicable to a similar new structure or use.
D. Uses of Open Land. If any use of open land is hereafter established or if any use of open land is hereafter changed to another use, such new use shall comply with all the provisions of these regulations, unless permitted by Sections 8-103 and 106.
E. Exemptions.
1. Poles, wires, cables, conduits, vaults, lift stations, laterals, pipes, mains, valves or other similar equipment for the distribution to consumers of telephones or other communications, electricity, gas or water, or the collection of sewage or surface water, but not including major utility substations located on or above the surface of the ground.

2. Railroad tracks, signals, bridges and similar facilities and equipment located on railroad rights-of-way, and maintenance and repair work on such facilities and equipment.
3. Buildings, structures or land used, but not just leased, by the federal government.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 3 Page 24
4. Use of land for agricultural purposes as defined in Section 2-102, including accessory buildings and structures thereon not in a designated floodplain. When any land or accessory buildings or structures cease to be used only for agriculture, then it shall be subject to the applicable provisions of these regulations.
101 Districts, Zoning Maps and Boundaries.
A. Establishment of Districts. The zoning jurisdiction is hereby divided into the districts as described in Article 4. References to "agricultural districts" shall mean those districts in which agricultural uses are the main permitted use. References to "residential districts" shall mean those districts in which residential uses are the main permitted use. References to "business districts" shall mean those districts in which commercial uses are the main permitted uses. References to "industrial districts" shall mean those districts in which industrial uses are the main permitted use. The "floodplain district" is considered as an overlay zone to be used in conjunction with the other districts.
B. Zoning Maps.
1. The boundaries of the districts described in Article 4 are as indicated on the Official Zoning Map(s) which is on file with the Zoning Administrator and identified on its face as part of these regulations. The zoning map(s) with all notations, references and other matters shown thereon is as much a part of these regulations as if specifically set forth herein. (See Section 9-100A9 for zoning map(s) certificate and revisions.)
2. It is the intent of these regulations that the entire area of the zoning jurisdiction, including all the land and water areas, rivers, streets, alleys and railroads and other rights-of-way, be included in the districts established in these regulations. Any area not shown on the zoning map(s) as being included in any district shall be deemed to be in the most restrictive district.
C. Boundaries. In the event that uncertainties exist with respect to the intended boundaries of the various districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map(s), the following rules shall apply:
1. Where boundary lines are indicated as approximately following streets, alleys, easements, railroads, rivers, streams or bodies of water, such boundaries shall be construed as following the centerlines thereof or otherwise are construed to coincide with lot or tract lines, unless otherwise indicated.
2. Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of boundaries as stated in Section 3-101C1 above, the district boundaries shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning map, unless an exact distance is shown.
3. Where a district boundary line divides a lot or unsubdivided property in single ownership, the regulations for either portion of the lot may, at the owner's discretion, extend to the entire lot, but not more than 25 feet beyond the boundary line of the district.
D. Zoning of Rights-of-Way. All streets, alleys, public ways, waterways and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 3 Page 25
as the property immediately abutting them. Where the centerline of a street, alley, public way, waterway or railroad right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline.
102 General Requirements for All Zoning Districts.
A. Permitted Uses. No structure shall hereafter be built, moved or structurally altered and no structure or land shall hereafter be used, occupied or designed for use or occupancy except for a use that is permitted within the zoning district in which the structure or land is located or provided for otherwise in these regulations. (See Section 2-102 for definition of PERMITTED USE.)
B. Special Uses. No use of a structure or land that is designated as a special use in any zoning district shall hereafter be established, and no existing special use shall hereafter be changed to another special use in such district, unless a special use is approved in the same manner as for an amendment to a zoning district except that the Official Zoning Map(s) is not amended. The latter procedure is set forth in Section 11-101 with the additional requirement that all conditions further imposed upon the special use be made a part of the effectuating ordinance. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SPECIAL USE.)
C. Conditional Uses. No use of a structure or land that is designated as a conditional use in any zoning district shall hereafter be established and no existing conditional use shall hereafter be changed to another conditional use in such district, unless a conditional use as an exception is approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided for in Section 10-108. (See Section 2-102 for a definition of CONDITIONAL USE.)
D. Lot Sizes.
1. No structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be built, moved or structurally altered and no structure or land shall hereafter be used, occupied, arranged or designed for use of occupancy on a zoning lot, unless otherwise provided for in these regulations, which in its district is:

b. Narrower than the minimum lot width required; or
c. Shallower than the minimum lot depth required.
2. Where independent dwelling units are to be sold as condominiums, minimum lot size requirements shall not apply to each individual ownership, but shall be applied collectively to the common open space surrounding the structure(s) such that the total open space is an aggregate of the minimum lot area required for each dwelling unit; however, the minimum lot width and depth for the district shall be applied to the entire zoning lot.
E. Bulk Regulations. In these regulations, bulk requirements are expressed in terms of maximum structure height, maximum lot coverage, minimum setbacks and minimum front, side and rear yards.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 3 Page 26

B. Platted Building Setback Lines. If a recorded subdivision plat imposes a building setback line or a front yard for a lot which is different from the minimum setback or yard required by the applicable section of these regulations, then, notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations, the minimum building setback or front yard shall be the same as that shown on such subdivision plat; provided, that it has been recorded and not otherwise been officially vacated.
C. Average Setback in Existing Residential Districts.
1. On streets where a front yard more than that required by these regulations has been maintained for existing structures on lots having a frontage of 50% or more of the total frontage on one side of that portion of the street line between two intersecting streets, there shall be maintained a front yard setback of not less than the average setback of the existing structures; provided, that these regulations shall not be interpreted to require a front yard setback of more than 50 feet.
2. On streets where a front yard less than that required by these regulations has been maintained for existing structures on lots having a frontage of 50% or more of the total frontage on one side of that portion of the street line between two intersecting streets, the front yard setback need not be greater than the average setback of the existing structures; provided, that these regulations shall not be interpreted to permit a front yard setback of less than 20 feet.
D. Yard Requirements for Open Land. If a zoning lot is, or will be, occupied by a permitted use without structures, then the minimum front, side and rear yards that would otherwise be required for the zoning lot shall be provided and maintained, unless some other provision of these regulations requires or permits a different minimum front, side or rear yard. Such yards shall not be required on zoning lots used for open public recreation areas.

F. Permitted Obstructions in Required Yards. The following shall not be considered to be obstructions when located in a required yard: (See Section 9-101A3 for principal or accessory buildings or structures or uses locating on or projecting over public easements.)
1. In all yards: Open terraces or patios not over four feet above the average level of the adjoining ground, but not including a permanent roof over a terrace or patio; awnings; canopies including underlying islands for petroleum pumps; steps four feet or less above grade which are necessary for access to a permanent structure or for access to a lot or to a lot from a street or alley including access to conform to the standards of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as incorporated into state statutes; fire escapes, one story bay windows and overhanging eaves and gutters projecting 36 inches or less into the yard; chimneys, entrance hoods, window wells and daylight windows projecting 36 inches or less into the yard; arbors and trellises; flagpoles and basketball goals; ornamental light or gas fixtures; parking, when permitted by Article 5; accessory and temporary uses, when permitted by Article 6; signs, when permitted by Article 7; and when otherwise specifically permitted by the district regulations.

City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 3 Page 29
a subdivision is exempt from the above open space rule with approval of the Zoning Administrator.
4. Construction standard for all fences: No fence shall be constructed which will constitute a hazard to traffic or a danger to persons or animals. (See Section 2-102 for definition of FENCE.)
5. Conditional use for fences: The Board of Zoning Appeals may as a conditional use approve the construction of higher fences and/or less open space in all yards and in any district if the Board finds that the public welfare is preserved.
G. Lot Size Requirements and Bulk Regulations for Utility Facilities. Notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations, none of the following utility or communication facilities shall be required to comply fully with the lot size requirements and bulk regulations of the zoning district in which they are located, except as may be determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals where a conditional use is required in certain districts and by subsection three of the definition for height, maximum in Section 2-102: (See Section 3-100E1 for Exemptions.)
1. Communication structures.
2. Electric and telephone substations.
3. Gas regulator stations.
4. Pumping stations.
5. Water towers or standpipes.
H. Access to Business and Industrial Districts. No land which is located in a residential district shall be used for a driveway, walkway or access purpose to any land which is located in any business or industrial district.
I. Annexed Land. All land which may hereafter be annexed shall retain its existing County zoning classification until such time as the property owner, Planning Commission or Governing Body may file an application for rezoning to a City zoning classification. If such rezoning is not initiated within 180 days after annexation, then the Planning Commission shall initiate an application(s) to determine the proper zoning. Rezoning may also be considered during the process of annexation. While the Planning Commission may hold their required public hearing on a rezoning amendment or a special use prior to annexation, the zoning ordinance approving the amendment or special use cannot be effectuated until the land is first officially annexed by the Governing Body by a separate annexation ordinance. While both ordinances may be published on the same day, the annexation ordinance must be published first if they are published on separate days. (See Appendix for Table of Comparability of Zoning Districts.)
J. Sewer and Water Facilities. All principal structures built hereafter shall be served by and connected to the City's sewer and water system, if such facilities can be feasibly provided as may be determined by the Governing Body.
K. Dedication of Rights-of-Way and Easements. As a condition related to a rezoning amendment or a special use, the dedication of additional street rights-of-way; easements for utilities, drainage, access control, fire lanes, building setback lines and other purposes; and the construction, removal or replacement of public improvements
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 3 Page 30
necessary to the proper development of the property, may be required either by platting or replatting the land according to the City Subdivision Regulations or, in lieu of platting, by a legal document effectuating such dedications and improvements. Such condition may be required whether the property is being divided or held in single ownership. A stated time limit not exceeding one year may be established to ensure compliance with the above conditions during which time the effectuation of the zoning amendment or special use having been approved with such conditions by the Governing Body shall be withheld from publication by the Clerk. Failure to comply with the conditions during the stated period shall result in making the zoning amendment or special use null and void. No extension of the time period may be granted without reapplication for a zoning case requesting reconsideration only of the specific condition requiring such dedication.
L. Floodplain Requirements. Within any floodplain area as delineated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, no use of land shall commence or no structure shall hereafter be constructed, structurally altered, extended, enlarged or moved under these regulations, unless it also complies with the floodplain regulations. (See Appendix for FP Floodplain District.)
M. Moving Structures. No structure shall be moved into the City, nor from one location to another location within the City, unless such structure shall, when relocated, be made to conform fully with these regulations and other codes of the City including any building codes. No zoning permit shall be issued, unless in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator the heights, age, architectural style and texture of the materials pertaining to the outward appearance of such structure reasonably conform to other buildings in the block to which it is to be moved and in the block opposite, to such an extent that its relocation shall not be detrimental to the appearance or have no substantial adverse effect on property values to the adjacent properties. Modifications in the appearance of such a structure as proposed by the applicant may be considered in making such a decision and conditions may be attached to the issuance of the permit by the Administrator to achieve conformance. In addition, the movement of a structure into or within the City shall not be permitted and/or authorized unless or until the following further conditions are complied with:
1. That the party seeking the relocation of the structure shall provide written proof of ownership showing that said applicant is owner of record of the lot onto which the structure is to be moved;
2. That said applicant shall acquire contemporaneously with the house moving permit a building permit to place said structure onto a foundation if said structure is to remain within the City as opposed to simply being moved through the City;
3. That no structure shall be moved into the city limits or moved from its foundation in the city limits for relocation to another location within the City, unless or until an approved foundation is in place at the lot within the City on which it is to be set;
4. That any structure removed from its foundation and awaiting approval of the new foundation, may not be stored, parked, situated or remain within the city limits until such foundation receives approval and is immediately thereafter moved to the foundation as approved;
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 3 Page 31
5. That in conjunction with applying for a house moving permit to move a structure to another location within the City or to bring a structure into the City, the applicant shall provide an irrevocable letter of credit or performance bond assuring that said applicant, will affix the structure to an approved foundation, not less than 30 days following the placement of the structure to the new foundation, within the City. All modifications to the structure shall be completed and ready for an occupancy permit within four months from the date the structure is placed on its foundation; and
6. That said letter of credit or performance bond shall be irrevocable and shall be in an amount as determined by the Zoning Administrator for the City, naming the City of Park City, Kansas, as the payee thereof in the amount specified by the Director.
N. Status of Moving Manufactured or Mobile Homes. Notwithstanding other provisions of these regulations, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue a zoning permit for manufactured or mobile homes under the following provisions; except, that all such homes must meet the floodplain district requirements and none may be replaced in a floodway overlay boundary:
1. Wherever a manufactured or mobile home is moved from a zoning lot within a district in which it is a permitted use, another manufactured or mobile home meeting the requirements of the district may be moved onto the lot at any time.
2. In the case of a lawful, nonconforming manufactured or mobile home use, such a move must take place within 90 days from the date that the previous manufactured or mobile home was moved off the lot, otherwise such use shall not thereafter be reestablished and, when so moved in, only manufactured homes not constructed more than ten years previously are permitted as replacements which shall be skirted or placed on a permanent-type, enclosed perimeter foundation. In reestablishing such a home use, any existing nonconforming lot size requirements or bulk regulations shall not be increased in nonconformity and no newly acquired land can be used for placement of such a home.
3. No manufactured or mobile home, or portion thereof, shall be moved onto any lot or parcel or an existing home converted for storage or any other purpose than for a residence in any district and no such home shall be temporarily located in any district not otherwise permitting such homes. These provisions do not preclude the use of prefabricated mobile structures for offices in business or industrial districts, but not manufactured or mobile homes unless specifically permitted.
4. In the event of disasters, such as fires, tornados or floods, whereby expediency is an important factor, a manufactured or mobile home or RV camper may be located temporarily in any district at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator with appropriate conditions attached and for a stated period of time.
5. Where an unusual hardship is shown, the Board of Zoning Appeals may approve a conditional use for a manufactured or mobile home or RV camper as an accessory use to be located on a lot or tract with an existing dwelling for a
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 3 Page 32
stated period of time. A time period may be extended upon request to the Board of Zoning Appeals without further notice or fee.
O. Vision Triangle. On all corner lots in all districts, no use of land shall commence or no structure shall hereafter be constructed, structurally altered, extended, enlarged or moved after the effective date of these regulations unless it also conforms to the requirements of the vision triangle as defined by Section 2-102.
104 Screening and Landscaping.
Screening and/or landscaping shall be provided when a zoning permit is issued on all properties developed for multiple-family, manufactured home park and all nonresidential uses when such uses are established on property within or adjacent to any residential districts in accordance with standards and procedures as listed below. In anticipation of a need for screening, such matters are proper subjects to be discussed and, if deemed desirable, decided at any hearing for a zoning district amendment or a special use. In addition to the requirement for screening as stated above, screening may further be required at such a hearing to preserve the value of an existing use or the potential for future development of any adjacent land or land across a right-of-way.
A. Screening shall be provided along all side or rear lot lines adjacent to such residential districts.
B. Landscaping shall be provided along a front lot line to the depth of at least 10 feet whenever such front lot line is adjacent to or across from such residential districts. No other uses except driveways and signs as permitted by Article 7 shall be allowed in such a landscaped area.
C. Screening shall be provided on all required development sufficient to reasonably hide from ground level view all loading docks, trash receptacles, outdoor storage, outdoor display, outdoor working areas, parking spaces and similar uses from such residential districts. In all commercial districts, trash receptacles shall be enclosed to a height of at least six feet. If trash receptacles are taller than six feet, then the screening shall be of sufficient height to contain blowing trash.
D. Screening on the side or rear lot line may be reduced in height and intensity in the front yard area extending to the front lot line, i.e., the street right-of-way; however, screening shall not be required along such lot lines in that portion of the front yard which may be landscaped.
E. Whenever properties are developed adjacent to an alley, screening may be omitted at driveways deemed essential for ingress and egress to uses established on the property.
F. Screening may consist of fencing and/or landscaping provided that such screening will serve to adequately reduce:
1. The visual effects on the environment caused by adjacent nonresidential or higher density residential uses;
2. Noise;
3. Lighting;
4. Glare; and
5. Blowing trash.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 3 Page 33
In business and industrial districts adjacent to residential districts wood fencing or solid walls shall be used to a height of at least six feet.
G. All screening and landscaping shall meet the requirements of the vision triangle in Section 3-103O. (See Section 2-102 for definition of VISION TRIANGLE.)
H. Landscaping along the front lot line shall involve bringing the soil surface to a smooth finished grade and installing sufficient trees, shrubs, ground cover and grass to soften building lines, provide shade and generally produce a pleasing visual effect of the premises.
I. The selection of landscape materials shall consider the "mature" growth and habit of such plants so that vegetation will not overhang or obstruct the public street or a sidewalk area in such a manner as to conflict with pedestrian and vehicular access.
J. The type of fencing should be compatible with the kind and intensity of the land use and the architectural style of the development and adjacent properties.
K. Whenever such screening is required, a screening plan for the area shall accompany the application for a zoning permit. Such plan shall be transmitted to the Zoning Administrator for their review and approval prior to the issuance of the zoning permit.
L. The screening plan shall be in such detail as to provide enough information to determine if the plan meets the above criteria. Such plan shall contain the location, type and height of any fence and the location, mature size and the type of any plant materials along with their common and botanical names. The sizing, grading and condition of the plant materials shall be specified according to the American Association of Nurserymen Standards.
M. The Planning Commission may, in its discretion, temporarily or permanently waive the requirements for screenings and/or landscaping if:
1. The adjacent land use in the residential district may not necessitate nor benefit from such a requirement; or
2. The adjacent land use may already have provided adequate screening for which additional screening may be a duplication; or
3. The future land use for the adjacent area can not readily be determined at this time and that upon mutual agreement of the Planning Commission and the applicant, that the requirements may be waived and the matter reviewed at a specified date in the future. In the meanwhile, the Planning Commission shall require that either a letter of assurance or a covenant be submitted to run with the land; or a guarantee in the form of a corporate security bond, cashier's check, escrow account or other security be submitted to ensure that such requirements will be met when a determination is made. The Planning Commission may determine the sufficiency of the assurance based on the length of time anticipated before a decision, the size and cost of the potential work involved, and the need to ensure that the requirement is met regardless of any change in ownership.
4. Section 3-104M3 above shall not prevent the Planning Commission from requiring temporary screening on all or a portion of a side or rear yard wherein a nonresidential use is proposed for development adjacent to an existing single-
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 3 Page 34
family dwelling and thereby a potential nuisance or hazard may be created for the homeowner.
N. All plant materials shall be healthy and/or fencing in place prior to issuance of an occupancy certificate. A temporary certificate may be issued as provided for in Section 9-101B2 without the landscaping installation; provided, written assurances are given which are satisfactory to the Zoning Administrator that the planting will take place when the proper season arrives.
O. Maintenance.
1. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain in good condition all of the required screening and landscaping improvements on his property. When it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that improvements required by Section 3-104 are not being maintained, it is his duty to give notice in writing to the property owner. Such notice shall specify in what manner the improvements are in need of maintenance and a date for compliance. The owner shall have not less than 30 days to comply with the notice; provided, however, that any person aggrieved by any such order and disagreeing with any of the requirements of the notice, may file an appeal under Section 10-106 within the 30-day filing period with the Board of Zoning Appeals.
2. If the owner of the land has failed, refused or neglected to make the necessary maintenance repairs within the time of the notice or time designated by the Board, then the Zoning Administrator shall cause such maintenance to be done to the property. The cost of maintenance shall be certified by the Administrator to the Clerk, who shall cause the costs to be assessed against the property on which the maintenance repairs were made.
P. To assist in reviewing screening and landscape plans, the Planning Commission may from time to time adopt design criteria in the form of policy statements which may include illustrations.

113 P-O Protective Overlay District.
This district may be applied as an overlay district in combination with any underlying zoning district except the FP Floodplain District. By limiting specific uses or requiring more restrictive development standards to individual projects or specific properties, this district is intended to:
(1) Ensure compatibility among incompatible or potentially incompatible land uses;
(2) Ease the transition from one zoning district to another;
(3) Address sites or land uses with special requirements; and
(4) Guide development of unusual situations or unique circumstances.
Development standards include, but are not limited to, lot sizes, bulk requirements, use limitations, off-street parking and loading provisions, accessory structures and uses, sign standards, supplemental requirements of Section 3-103 and screening and landscape requirements of Section 3-104.
A. Use and Development Standards. This district can be used to modify and restrict the use and development standards of an underlying zoning district. All requirements of this district are in addition to and supplement all other applicable standards and requirements of these regulations. Restrictions and conditions imposed by this district shall be limited to the following:
1. Prohibiting otherwise permitted or special or conditional uses and accessory uses; or making an otherwise permitted use a special or conditional use;
2. Decreasing the number or average density of dwelling units that may be constructed on the site;
3. Increasing minimum lot size or lot width;
4. Increasing minimum setback requirements in any yard;
5. Restrictions on access to abutting properties and streets, including specific design features; and
6. Any other development standards required or authorized by these regulations.
B. Method of Adoption. Modifications and restrictions imposed through this district are considered part of this zoning text and accompanying map. All property included in the district shall be identified on the Official Zoning Map by adding the letters "P-O" to the base zoning district symbol. The effectuating ordinance for zoning or rezoning property to the P-O District shall specifically state the modifications or restrictions imposed pursuant to Section 4-113A. Such modifications and restrictions imposed shall be considered part of the text of these regulations and a violation of them shall be a violation of these regulations. The modifications and restrictions shall continue in full force and effect until revised in accordance with the same amendment procedures as for the approval of the original P-O District.
C. Effect of P-O District Designation. When the P-O District zoning designation is applied in combination with an underlying zoning district, it shall always be considered to result in a more restrictive designation than if the district did not have the P-O classification. In the event that the P-O designation was not originally requested as part of the rezoning application, but is added instead during the public hearing process, re-notification and re-advertisement of the requested zoning amendment shall not be required.

Front yard setback parking where allowed requires a City permit, and must comply with City standards maintained by the Zoning Administrator. Multiple-family dwellings may have paved parking in the front yard setback. Principal buildings with garages and carports integrated into or attached to the buildings which contain or shelter off-street parking spaces shall be subject to the yard setback requirements applicable in the district wherein the buildings are located.

Off-street parking spaces may be open to the sky or enclosed in a building or structure. Parking on driveways for single and two-family dwellings and all types of manufactured and mobile homes is considered to be permitted temporary parking and required permanent parking spaces on such lots are not to be in the front yard setback. All parking spaces must be in an identifiable area where all spaces are contained thereon. (See Section 5-100A5c for screening.)
b. Surfacing: All open off-street parking spaces, whether required spaces or not, and driveways shall be graded and paved with asphaltic concrete, or concrete. Residential properties having lots of five acres or more may be allowed to have dustless surfaces in lieu of asphaltic concrete, or concrete for their driveways. This exception does not exempt the property from paving requirements across City right-of-way. Dustless, graveled parking areas are permitted for single family dwellings pursuant to Article 5-100A.
c. Screening: Screening for parking spaces and loading areas is incorporated into the general screening and landscaping provisions of Section 3-104.
d. Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking spaces shall be shaded so that direct light is not cast upon property located in a residential district and so that glare is not a problem to traffic on any public street.
e. Repair and service: No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind shall be permitted in association with any off-street parking spaces or structures, except as incidental repairs to a personal vehicle. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SALVAGE YARD.)
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 5 Page 75
f. Computation: When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by these regulations results in a requirement of a fractional space, the fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, and a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
g. Collective provisions: Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so furnished is not less than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use; provided, that wherever there is a common plan of parking for land in single ownership that the amount of required parking shall consider the joint use of such space whenever large places of assembly are present which vary in their times of use and season of the year to the end that all parking is contained on the site or on accessory parking lots except for infrequent periods of peak use. The off-street parking spaces required by Section 5-101 may be increased; however, where it is anticipated that peak parking periods will be a consistently reoccurring problem. All regulations must be adhered to which cover the location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served.
h. Location: All parking spaces required to serve structures or uses shall be located on the same zoning lot as the structure or use served unless a conditional use permit is obtained under Section 5-102.
i. Employee parking: Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing, or both, on the premises at any one time.
j. Handicapped parking: Parking spaces according to the numbers of spaces and their designated signage shall be provided for handicapped persons based on the standards of the federal and state Americans with Disabilities Act.
k. In industrial zones, areas for storage of equipment and parking for semi-trucks may request a waiver from the Zoning Administrator to install dustless materials.

No zoning permit for any sign shall be issued unless the sign complies with the regulations of this Article 7. All signs lawfully existing at the time of passage of these regulations may remain in use, including those in the status of legal nonconformance. The purpose of this article is to safeguard the public use of the streets and the sidewalk area and to equitably enhance the visual environment of the City. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SIGN.) (See K.S.A. 68-2231 et seq. for state sign regulations which also have to be met and are administered by the Kansas Department of Transportation.)
101 Classification of Signs.
A. Functional Types:
1. Advertising Sign: A sign which directs attention to a business, commodity, service or entertainment conducted, sold or offered at a location other than the premises on which the sign is located or to which it is affixed. Such a sign may also be used to convey political and public service announcements. No such sign shall be attached to a stationary vehicle or a portion thereof which is intended for public display on a zoning lot. Advertising signs along state or federal highways must receive prior approval from the Kansas Department of Transportation before a local zoning permit can be issued.
2. Bulletin Board Sign: A sign that indicates the name of an institution or organization on whose premises it is located and which contains the name or names of persons connected with it, and announcements of persons, events or activities occurring at the institution. Such sign may also present a greeting or similar message.
3. Business Sign: A sign which directs attention to a business or profession conducted; or to a commodity or service sold, offered or manufactured; or an entertainment offered on the premises where the sign is located or to which it is affixed.
4. Construction Sign: A temporary sign indicating the names of designers and contractors involved in the construction of a project during the construction period and only on the premises on which the construction is taking place.
5. Identification Sign: A sign giving the name and address of a building, business, development or establishment. Such signs may be wholly or partly devoted to a readily recognized symbol.
6. Nameplate Sign: A sign giving the name and/or address of the owner or occupant of a building or premises on which it is located, and where applicable, their professional status.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 7 Page 90
7. Real Estate Sign: A sign pertaining to the sale or lease of the lot or tract of land on which the sign is located, or to the sale or lease of one or more structures, or a portion thereof located thereon, including auction signs.
B. Structural Types:
1. Awning, Canopy or Marquee Sign: A sign that is mounted or painted on, or attached to, an awning, canopy or marquee that is otherwise permitted by these regulations. No such sign shall project further below than seven feet from the ground level or beyond the physical dimensions of the awning, canopy or marquee.
2. Ground Sign: Any sign placed upon, or supported by, the ground independently of the principal building or structure on the property. A sign on accessory structures shall be considered a ground sign. Portable signs do not numerically count as ground signs for the district regulations.
3. Pole Sign: A sign that is mounted on a free-standing pole, the bottom edge of which sign is seven feet or more above ground level.
4. Projecting Sign: A sign that is wholly or partly dependent upon a building for support and which projects more than 12 inches from such building.
5. Roof Sign: A sign totally supported on the roof of a building which does not project more than 12 inches beyond the face of the structure.
6. Temporary Sign: A sign in the form of a banner, pennant, valance or advertising display constructed of fabric, card board, wallboard or other light weight materials, with or without a frame, intended for temporary display of not more than 30 days at a time.
7. Wall Sign: A sign fastened to or painted on a wall of a building or structure in such a manner that the wall becomes merely the supporting structure or forms the background surface, and which does not project more than 12 inches from such building.
102 General Standards.
A. Gross Surface Area of Sign. The entire area within a single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of such sign, and in no case passing through or between any adjacent elements of same. Such perimeter shall not include any structural elements lying outside the limits of such sign and which do not form an integral part of the display. When two or more signs are located on a zoning lot, the gross surface area of all signs on the lot shall not exceed the maximum gross surface per street frontage set by the applicable district regulations, except as is provided by Section 7-102B. Signs on interior lots which may be viewed from both directions of the adjacent street are considered to have a single gross surface area.
B. Corner and Through Lots. On corner and through lots, each lot line that abuts a street or highway shall be considered a separate street frontage. On corner and through lots, restrictions that are phased in terms of the number of signs per zoning lot shall be deemed to permit the allowable number of signs to face each street or highway that abuts the lot.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 7 Page 91
C. Height of Sign. The maximum height of signs shall be measured from ground level at the base of or below the sign to the highest element of the sign and shall be determined for purposes of Article 7 as independent from the maximum structure height for zoning districts.
D. Building and Electrical Codes Applicable. All signs must conform to the structural design standards of any applicable building code. Wiring of all electrical signs must conform to any applicable electrical code.
E. Illuminated Signs. Signs shall be shaded wherever necessary to avoid casting bright light upon property located in any residential district or upon any public street or park. Any brightly illuminated sign, located on a lot adjacent to or across the street from any residential district, which is not otherwise shaded and visible from such residential district, shall not be illuminated between the hours of 11 P.M. and 7 A.M.
F. Flashing or Moving Signs. No flashing signs, rotating or moving signs, animated signs, signs with moving lights or signs which create the illusion of movement shall be permitted in any residential district.
G. Metal and Non-Metal Signs. Signs constructed of metal and illuminated by any means requiring internal wiring or electrically wired accessory fixtures attached to a metal sign shall maintain a free clearance to grade of nine feet. Accessory lighting fixtures attached to a non-metal frame sign shall maintain a clearance of nine feet to grade. Metal or non-metal signs, whether illuminated or not, shall maintain a clearance of at least seven feet underneath awnings, canopies or marquees.
H. Access Way or Window. No sign shall block any access way or window required by any applicable building, housing, fire or other codes or regulations.
I. Signs on Trees or Utility Poles. No private sign shall be attached to a tree or utility pole whether on public or private property.
J. Traffic Safety.
1. No sign shall be maintained at any location where by reason of its position, size, shape or color; it may obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of, or be confused with; any traffic control sign, signal or device; or where it may interfere with, mislead or confuse traffic.
2. No sign shall be located in any vision triangle as defined in Section 2-102, except official traffic signs and signs mounted eight feet or more above the ground whose supports, not exceeding two, do not exceed 12 inches at the widest dimension and, thus, do not constitute an obstruction.
K. Location. No sign shall be permitted on a public right-of-way or public easement, except signs which may be placed on the public right-of-way with the approval of the adjacent landowner. Such signs shall not obstruct traffic visibility and must be set back a minimum of ten feet from the edge of the street or back of curb. Such signs for real estate and garage sales may only be displayed during an open house or a garage sale and must be removed at the conclusion of such open house or sale. Such signs for political campaigns can be displayed not more than 30 days prior to an election and must be removed not later than two days after an Election Day. No sign shall be permitted to project over a public right-of-way or public easement, except with the
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 7 Page 92
approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals as a conditional use. (See Section 7-102L2 for portable signs, Section 7-103A5 for garage sale signs and Section 7-103B5 for real estate signs.
L. Portable Signs. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations and, in particular, Article 7, the following provisions apply to the use of portable signs:
1. A portable sign is defined as a temporary on-site sign designed in such a manner as to be readily movable and not permanently attached to the premises, such as A-frames, trailer signs, signs placed on vehicles, beacon lights and other similar signs. Any such sign shall not exceed a height of 10 feet above grade level nor 60 square feet in gross surface area.
2. All the general standards of Sections 7-102A through K are applicable to portable signs, except that in Section 7-102K such signs may project over or be located on public easements, but not the public street right-of-way. No such sign shall be placed on the top of structures.
3. Whereas portable signs are not required to set back any minimum distance from lot lines in any zoning district, the Zoning Administrator shall, in his discretion, strictly enforce the traffic safety provisions of Section 7-102J1, especially at corner intersections and driveway entrances and exits.
4. In all zoning districts, except residential districts, portable signs are permitted; however, any such sign shall not be located closer than 50 feet to another such sign when measured along the frontage whether the latter is located on the same or another zoning lot, except that each business firm shall be permitted at least one such sign notwithstanding the 50 foot minimum spacing standard.
5. In all residential districts only portable signs are permitted which limit their messages to the following subjects:
a. Announcements of special occasions or activities of nonprofit organizations such as churches and fraternal and service clubs.
b. Announcements related to personal or family events such as "Happy Birthday" and the like.
The above signs are limited to a display period of not more than 72 hours for any one announcement with the gross surface area not to exceed 32 square feet and only one sign at a time permitted on the premises of the party making the announcement.
6. In addition to the provisions of Sections 7-102D and E, strobe light sources or flashing bulbs or signs which create the illusion of movement shall not be permitted on portable signs in any district. Electrified portable signs shall not be connected to any electrical power source except during the hours when the business, office or institution is open. Electrical lines shall not be permitted to lay on the ground where vehicular traffic or pedestrian passage is allowed and the use of extension cords for portable signs is prohibited. Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (G.F.C.I.) are required on all electrified signs.
7. A zoning permit for each portable sign shall be obtained for each 30 day period or part thereof when the sign remains on the zoning lot. Annual permits may be
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 7 Page 93
obtained for the use of such signs at one or more locations during the year. All portable signs shall bear an identification marker to indicate the owner's name and some system of identifying the individual sign, e.g., by number.
8. Any unauthorized portable sign placed on public property, including the public street right-of-way, is declared to be a public nuisance and be the cause of its removal and impoundment without notice. If not redeemed within 30 days by the owner paying a service charge, the City may dispose of the sign in any manner deemed appropriate. The Zoning Administrator may revoke the permit for any sign deemed to be in violation of this Section, i.e., 7-102L, or of any condition on which the permit was based and order its removal within a reasonable period consistent with public safety.
M. Damaged, Deteriorated or Unsafe Signs. The Zoning Administrator shall require the immediate repair or removal of any conforming or nonconforming sign or sign structure which has been damaged or deteriorated so as to become a public nuisance or hazard. Such a sign or sign structure may be restored to its original condition without obtaining a zoning permit, unless the sign is replaced and, thus, must conform to the current regulations.
N. Abandoned Signs. Any sign advertising a business that is not in operation for a period of six months shall be determined to be abandoned. The Zoning Administrator shall require such sign to be either removed or stripped of any reference to business operation. Such indication of business operation removal shall be accomplished in a manner pleasing to the public.
103 Exemptions.
A. The following signs shall be exempt from the requirements of this Article:
1. Signs of a duly constituted governmental body including school districts such as traffic or similar regulatory devices, legal notices, warnings at railroad crossings, identification purposes and other instructional or regulatory signs having to do with health, safety, parking, swimming, dumping, etc.

ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES
100 Purpose.
The purpose of this Article is to (1) provide for the regulation of nonconforming lots, buildings, structures and uses; and (2) specify those circumstances and conditions under which such nonconformities shall be permitted to continue. The right to continue a nonconforming lot, building, structure or use shall not be affected by a change in ownership or operator of the structure or use unless such ownership or operator is a condition attached to an approval for a special or conditional use. The definitions of such nonconformities are as follows:
A. Nonconforming Lot of Record: A zoning lot which is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning regulations and such lot now neither complies with the lot area requirements or the width for any permitted uses in the zoning district in which it is located.
B. Nonconforming Structure: An existing building or structure which does not comply with the maximum lot coverage and height or the minimum yard requirements which are applicable to new structures in the zoning district in which it is located.
C. Nonconforming Use: An existing use of a structure or land which does not comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Nonconformity. A nonconforming lot, use or structure that does not comply with currently applicable regulations, but that complied with zoning regulations in effect at the time it was legally established. (See Sections B-100 A, B, and C above and Section 8-107 for Registration of Nonconformities and Exemptions.)
101 Nonconforming Lots of Record.
A. In Any Residential District.
1. Notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other provision of these regulations, a single-family detached dwelling or residential-design manufactured home which is a permitted use by the applicable district regulations and complies with the restrictions in Section 8-101A2 may be located on a lot(s) in the same ownership that is not less than 50 feet in width and that consists entirely of a tract of land that:
a. Has less than the prescribed minimum lot area, width or depth, or all three; and
b. Meets the definition in Section 8-100A for a nonconforming lot of record.
2. Construction permitted by Section 8-101A1 shall comply with all of the regulations except lot area, width and depth applicable to a single-family dwelling or residential-design manufactured home permitted in the zoning district in which the lot in question is located; provided, however, that the following side yard
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 8 Page 100
requirements shall apply in place of the side yard requirements otherwise applicable:
a. The structure shall be placed on the lot so as to provide a yard on each side of the dwelling.
b. The sum of the widths of the two side yards on each lot shall be not less than the smaller of:
(1) 20% of the width of the lot, or
(2) the minimum total for both side yards prescribed by the bulk regulations for the zoning district.
c. In any case, neither side yard resulting from the methods permitted in Section 8-101A2b shall be less than five feet wide.
d. When a yard is also considered to be a front yard on a corner lot, one of the front yards comprising part of the lot width may be reduced to 15 feet; provided, that a driveway to a parking space must maintain a length of at least 20 feet from the front lot line
B. In Districts Other than Residential Districts.
1. Notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other provision of these regulations, a structure designed for any permitted use may be erected on a lot of the type described in Section 8-101A1.
2. Construction permitted by Section 8-101B1 shall comply with all of the regulations except minimum lot area, width and depth applicable in the zoning district in which the lot in question is located; provided, that the width of any side yard must not be less than that derived by applying the following formula (wherein the width of any side yard required = w):
Minimum side yard required X Actual lot width by district regulations
w= ______________________________________________________________________________________________
Minimum lot width required by district regulations
102 Nonconforming Structures.
A. Authority to Continue. Any structure which is devoted to a use which is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located on a lot which does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements and/or the applicable bulk regulations, may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions in Section 8-102B through 8-102D.
B. Enlargement, Repair or Alterations. Any such structure described in Section 8-102A may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or structurally altered; provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or alteration shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure, except that as to structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements, the side yard requirements shall be determined by Section 8-101A2 or 8-101B2, whichever is applicable.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 8 Page 101
C. Damage. In the event that any structure described in Section 8-102A is damaged, by any means except flooding, to the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located; provided, that structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements shall not in any event be required to provide a side yard that exceeds the yard requirements in Sections 8-101A2 or B2, whichever is applicable. When a structure is damaged to the extent of 50% or less of its fair market value, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a zoning permit is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. If the applicant is aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator in approving the percent of damage to the value of the structure based on data submitted by the applicant, an appeal may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a determination. (See Section 8-105 for Nonconforming Nonresidential Structures and Uses and Appendix for Substantial-Damage and Substantial-Improvement in the FP Floodplain District.)
D. Moving. No structure described in Section 8-102A shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved. (See Sec. 3-103M for Moving Structures.)
103 Nonconforming Uses.
A. Authority to Continue. Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of part or all of a structure or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land, not involving a structure or only involving a structure which is accessory to such use of land, may be continued, so long as otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations contained in Sections 8-103B through 8-103J.
B. Ordinary Repair and Maintenance.
1. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use; provided, however, that this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of Sections 8-103C through I of these regulations.
2. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition provided that such restoration will not be in violation of Section 8-103F of these regulations.
C. Structural Alteration. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered unless the entire structure and use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Extension.
1. Extension of a nonconforming use is permitted within a nonconforming structure to any portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of the original
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 8 Page 102
City Zoning Regulations or a subsequent amendment heretofore that caused such use to become nonconforming; provided, however, that no structural alterations shall be made unless such changes, and the use thereof, conform to the regulations of the district in which the structure is located.
2. Extension of a nonconforming use of a part of a structure is not permitted if all or substantially all of the structure is designed or intended for a use which is permitted in the district in which the structure is located, nor shall the use be changed to any other nonconforming use.
3. Extension of a nonconforming use is not permitted to any structure or land area other than the one actually occupied or used by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of the original City Zoning Regulations or a subsequent amendment heretofore that caused such use to become nonconforming.
E. Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
F. Damage. In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged, by any means except flooding, to the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. When such damage is 50% or less of the fair market value, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a zoning permit is obtained, and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial damage and is diligently pursued to completion. If the applicant is aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator in approving the percent of damage to the value of the structure based on data submitted by the applicant, an appeal may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a determination. (See Section 8-105 for Nonconforming Nonresidential Structures and Uses and Appendix for Substantial-Damage and Substantial-Improvement in the FP Floodplain District.)
G. Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. (See Section 3-103M for Moving Structures.)
H. Change in Use. If no structural alterations are made other than those necessary to repair or maintain the structure as described in Section 8-103B1, a nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a similar type of use or more restrictive use. Similarly, a nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or involving only an accessory structure may also be changed. When a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restrictive use or to any permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to a less restrictive use or to a nonconforming use. In determining whether a change in use is the same, similar or more restrictive, the Zoning
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 8 Page 103
Administrator shall consider the changes in environmental factors such as outdoor storage, loading, traffic, parking, noise, lighting, air pollution, hours of operation, screening and other factors, as well as the provisions available in Section 8-105. (See Section 9-101A for Zoning Permits and Section 9-101B for Occupancy Certificates.)
I. Abandonment.
1. When a nonconforming use of land, not involving a structure, or involving only a structure which is accessory to the nonconforming use of land, is abandoned for a period of six consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such land shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land is located.
2. When a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure which was designed and intended for any use which is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure is located, is abandoned for a period of 12 consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such structure is located.
3. When a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure which was not designed and intended for any use which is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure is located, is abandoned for a period of 12 consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such structure is located.
J. Nonconforming Accessory Uses. No use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use shall cease or terminate.
104 Nonconforming Residential Structures.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 8-103C, D and E, any structure which is devoted to a residential use and which is located in a business or industrial district, may be structurally altered, extended, expanded and enlarged; provided, that after any such alteration, extension, expansion or enlargement, such structure shall not be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than such structure accommodated prior to any such work unless specifically permitted by the district.
105 Nonconforming Nonresidential Structures and Uses.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations and, in particular, Sections 8-102 B and C and 8-103C, D, E and F, nonconforming nonresidential structures and uses that existed on the day prior to the effective date of these regulations, may apply on a one time basis only to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a conditional use to structurally alter, enlarge or reconstruct after damage, or make extensions to structures or uses including the use of additional land when properly zoned for the use, so long as in the opinion of the Board under stated conditions that the effect upon adjacent areas is protected to the extent feasible and the public interest served. (See Section 10-107C6 for Authorized Variances.)
106 Status of Existing Special and Conditional Uses.
A. The following procedures are to be followed to determine the status of existing special and conditional uses after their reclassification as lawful, permitted, special or conditional
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 8 Page 104
uses in these regulations to avoid nonconformities and to provide equitable conversions of such uses:
1. Where a use existed prior to the effective date of these regulations and was previously permitted only as a special use or as a conditional use, i.e., an exception approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals, such uses shall not be deemed to be nonconforming, but shall, without further action, be deemed to be a lawful special or conditional use as now classified with the same conditions applicable as originally established, unless reclassified now as a permitted use.
2. Where a use existed prior to the effective date of these regulations and any prior regulations and was or is now classified as a special use or as a conditional use, it shall be considered to be a lawful, conforming special or conditional use. Enlargement, extension or alterations to existing structures or land improvements for expansion of such lawful uses may be made within the area of the zoning lot which was actually used or occupied for such use on the effective date of these regulations and shall be subject to all requirements set forth in these regulations as a permitted use.
107 Registration of Nonconformities and Exemptions.
(See Sections 8-100D for Nonconformities and 3-100E for Exemptions.)
A. Purpose. Registration of nonconformities and exemptions, among other purposes, is to provide a property owner with a record of their nonconformity or exemption which may be in effect for many years. Such a record is very desirable since most nonconformities or exemptions are established in the past and the availability of personal witnesses and written documentation to confirm their status becomes more difficult due to the passage of time. This is particularly important since the person claiming the nonconformity or exemption has the burden to prove their claim by the preponderance of the evidence. Registration can be especially useful to property owners who may have a nonconformity or exemption created by changing their zoning status from the unincorporated area of a county to the City regulations.
B. Rights Conditioned. A lawfully established nonconformity including exemptions is a vested right protected by due process which is sometimes referred to as being “grandfathered-in”. In order to establish such a right, it is essential that it be created or commenced prior to the enactment of the regulations which restricted its establishment. A non conformity or exemption which violated the zoning regulations at its inception has no lawful right to continue. Once the validity of the nonconformity or exemption has been determined, it has the right to be sold, inherited, transferred or assigned unless restricted by a condition attached to a special or conditional use. Certain limitations, however, may be placed on the expansion, repair, maintenance and continuance of such nonconformities or exemption as may be determined by the provisions of Article 8 in these regulations. For example, continuance may be subject to abandonment or limited amortization of certain uses.
C. Registration Process. The Zoning Administrator shall establish a process for registration of nonconformities and exemptions and a system for making determinations thereof and keeping records of the same, while there shall be no deadline for registration, property owners anticipating the need for registration should do so at their earliest convenience.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 8 Page 105
D. Registration Determination. The Zoning Administrator shall determine the qualifications of the lot, use or structure for registration as to its legal, nonconforming status. Such determination in writing shall be based on the evidence submitted by the property owner requesting the registration.
E. Appeal. An aggrieved party may appeal the Zoning Administrator’s determination whether to register or not register the nonconformity or exemption to the Board of Zoning Appeals. (See Section 10-106 pertaining to Appeals.)

101 Zoning Permits and Occupancy Certificates.
The City may issue zoning permits and occupancy certificates concurrently with the process of issuing building and occupancy permits under City building codes.
A. Zoning Permits.
1. Unless a zoning permit shall first have been obtained from the Zoning Administrator, the construction, reconstruction, moving or structural alteration of any building or structure or the improvement of land prior to its use or the use of any land or structure being changed to any other use, shall not be commenced. For permits required on accessory uses, temporary uses, home occupations, plans for parking and loading space and signs, see Articles 5, 6 and 7. Such permits shall not be issued by any other official, employee, department, board or agency of the City, except as provided for as a temporary permit in Section 6-101. Any zoning permit issued in conflict with the provisions of these regulations shall be null and void. (See Section 8-103H for Change in Use.)
2. Except for a continuation of an existing use or occupancy, accessory structures or uses, or additions to existing structures or uses, permits must also meet the requirements of the City Subdivision Regulations and, thus, shall not be issued on land which is not shown on a recorded plat or replat, or a lot split or exempted from the platting requirements. If platting or replatting is not required, all of the public improvements necessary to carry out the requested permit nevertheless may be required, including dedications in lieu of platting such as for easements and additional rights-of-way.
3. No principal or accessory building or structure or use shall be permitted to locate on or project over any platted or recorded public easement or over any known utility installation, unless (1) as a sign permitted by Section 7-102K or (2) as an accessory structure or use which is moveable, relocatable or poses no significant problem to the maintenance of existing public improvement installations or to such future installations. Ground level extensions such as concrete slabs or other permanent-type materials are not permitted in or on a public easement except as extensions of parking spaces, driveways or sidewalks for which a zoning permit has been or is being issued. In any event, when such structures or uses are
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 9 Page 109
permitted to be located on or project over such easements, the property owner assumes the risk and liability for any reconstruction or replacement necessary including fences if any maintenance or other improvements are required by the City or a utility provider.
4. A zoning permit is not initially required for grading and/or excavating a proposed construction site, unless the site is located in a floodplain and would result in an increase in flood levels. (See Appendix for FP Floodplain District.)
5. Application. Every application for a zoning permit shall be accompanied by the following:
a. A drawing or copy of the recorded plat, in duplicate, of the piece or parcel of land, lot(s), block(s), parts or portions thereof, drawn to scale showing the actual dimensions of the zoning lot(s), including any easements thereon.
b. A drawing, in duplicate, drawn to scale and in such form as may, from time to time, be prescribed by the Zoning Administrator, showing the location, ground area, height and bulk of (1) all present and proposed structures, (2) drives, parking spaces and loading areas, (3) building setback lines in relation to lot lines, (4) waste disposal areas, (5) use to be made of such present and proposed structures on the land, and (6) such other information as may be required for the proper enforcement of these regulations.
One copy of such drawings shall be retained by the Zoning Administrator as a public record.
6. Issuance. A zoning permit shall be either issued or disapproved by the Zoning Administrator within 10 days after the receipt of an application thereof or within such further period as may be agreed to by the applicant. When the Administrator refuses to issue a zoning permit, the applicant shall be advised in writing of the reasons for the disapproval.
7. Period of Validity. A zoning permit shall become null and void 180 days after the date on which it is issued, unless within said period construction, reconstruction, moving or structural alteration of a structure is commenced or a use is commenced. If the construction or work is abandoned or suspended for any 180-day period after such a permit is issued, then application must be made to the Zoning Administrator for an extension of time to continue the project. The Administrator may grant reasonable extensions of time provided no changes have been made in any applicable regulations. If such changes have occurred, application must be made for a new permit based on the provisions of the new or amended regulations in order to continue the project, unless Section 2-100G applies pertaining to vesting of single-family residential developments. (See Section 2-100F for Effect of Existing Permits.)
B. Occupancy Certificates. No structure or addition thereto constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered after the effective date of these regulations shall be occupied or used for any purpose; and no land vacant on the effective date of these regulations shall be used for any purpose; and no use of any land or structure shall be changed to any other use, unless an occupancy certificate shall first have been obtained from the Zoning
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 9 Page 110
Administrator certifying that the proposed use or occupancy complies with all the provisions of these regulations. (See Section 8-103H for Change in Use.)
1. Application. Every application for a zoning permit shall be deemed to be an application for an occupancy certificate. Every occupancy certificate shall be filed in such form and contain such information as the Administrator shall provide by general rule.
2. Issuance.
a. No occupancy certificate for a structure or addition thereto constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered or for the new or changed use of any structure or land shall be issued after the effective date of these regulations until such work has been completed and the premises inspected and certified by the Zoning Administrator to be in full and complete compliance with the plans and specifications upon which the zoning permit was issued including the requirements for utilities, streets and other public improvements in the City Subdivision Regulations which must either be installed or guaranteed. Direct access must be available from the frontage of each zoning lot to an opened public street or otherwise the improvement of the street must be guaranteed by such methods as stated in the Subdivision Regulations.
b. An occupancy certificate shall be issued or written notice shall be given to the applicant stating the reasons why a certificate cannot be issued within 10 days after the receipt of an application therefore or after the Zoning Administrator is notified in writing that the structures or premises are ready for occupancy or use. Pending the issuance of a permanent occupancy certificate, a temporary occupancy certificate may be issued to be valid for a period not to exceed six months from its date pending the completion of any addition or improvement(s) or during partial occupancy of the premises; provided, satisfactory guarantees are submitted including the possible use of performance bonds or escrow accounts.
102 Enforcement and Liability.
A. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator or any deputies working under his or her direction to enforce the provisions of these regulations in consultation with the City Attorney in the following manner:
1. To refuse to issue any zoning permit or occupancy certificate for any building or structure or use of any premises which would violate any of the provisions herein.
2. To revoke a zoning permit and issue a stop order at any time for a building or structure or use for which the same was issued when it shall appear (1) that there is a departure from the plans, specifications or conditions as required under terms of the permit; (2) that the same was procured by false representation; (3) that it was issued by mistake, or (4) that it violates any provisions of the zoning regulations.
3. To cause any building, structure, place or premises to be inspected and examined as required by these regulations and to order in writing the remedying of any condition found to exist therein or threat in violation of any provisions herein.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 9 Page 111
4. To institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful action or use or to restrain, correct or abate such violation on or about the premises of any building or structure which is constructed, built, moved, structurally altered or reconstructed or land is used in violation of any provisions herein.
B. The Zoning Administrator or designee charged with the enforcement of these regulations, acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of the duties described herein, shall not be personally liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act or by reason of an act or omission in the discharge of such duties. A suit brought against the Administrator because of an act or omission performed by the Administrator in the enforcement of any provision of these regulations or other pertinent laws or ordinances implemented through the enforcement of these regulations shall be defended by the City until final termination of such proceedings, and any judgment resulting therefrom shall be assumed by the City. (See K.S.A. 75-6101, et seq. in general and K.S.A. 75-6109 specifically.)
103 Violations.
A. Penalties. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-761, as amended, any violations of these regulations shall be deemed to be a misdemeanor. The owner or agent of a building, structure or premises in or upon which a violation of any provision of these regulations has been committed or shall exist or the lessee or tenant of an entire building or entire premises in or upon which a violation has been committed or shall exist; or the agent, architect, building contractor or any other person who commits, takes part or assists in any violation or who maintains any building, structure or premises in or upon which a violation has been committed or shall exist, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500 or by imprisonment for not more than six months for each offense or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense.
B. Remedies. In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, structurally altered, converted or maintained; or any building, structure or land is used or is proposed to be used in violation of these regulations, the appropriate authorities of the City of Park City, in addition to using other remedies, may institute injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or to correct or abate such violation, or to prevent the occupancy of such building, structure or land. In addition to the City, any person, the value or use of whose property is or may be affected by such violation, shall have the authority to maintain suits or actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce these regulations and to abate nuisances in violation thereof.
C. Floodplain Violations. (See Appendix for Section G in the FP Floodplain District.)
104 Fees.
For purposes of wholly or partially defraying the costs of the administrative and enforcement provisions described in these regulations, including publication costs, the applicant upon filing an application for an amendment, special use, appeal, conditional use, variance or a zoning permit including occupancy certificate, shall pay the Clerk a fee according to the fee schedule approved by the Governing Body. No part of such fee shall thereafter be refunded.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 9 Page 112
105 Reports.
The Zoning Administrator shall periodically report verbally or in writing to the Governing Body and the Planning Commission a summary of all zoning permits issued during the preceding period, giving details of any permitted variations, as well as the current status of all applications in process for amendments, special uses, appeals, conditional uses and variances. Such a report shall include comments on any problems encountered in the administration or enforcement of these regulations which may especially be of use at the annual review established by Section 11-105.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 10 Page 113
ARTICLE 10. BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
100 Authorization.
The Planning Commission as previously established by the Governing Body has been designated to also serve as the Board of Zoning Appeals as prescribed by K.S.A. 12-759, as amended, and hereinafter in this Article will be referred to as the "Board."
101 General Procedures.
All members of the Planning Commission are voting members of the Board whether they reside inside or outside the city limits and shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for expenses when authorized by the Governing Body. All officers of the Planning Commission are officers of the Board including the Secretary. Public records shall be kept of all official actions of the Board which shall be maintained separately from the Planning Commission by the Secretary. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing evidence presented at hearings, findings of fact, decisions and the vote of each member upon each question. If absent, abstaining or disqualified from voting, such fact shall be indicated. Special meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine in its bylaws. Board meetings may be held separately from a Planning Commission meeting or in conjunction with such a meeting wherein the Planning Commission may recess a portion of its meeting to conduct business of the Board and to reconvene to continue the Planning Commission agenda. When a quorum is declared present, all actions of the Board including appeals, variances and conditional uses as exceptions shall be made by motion and decided by a majority vote of the members present and voting.
The Board shall adopt rules for its operation in the form of bylaws which shall include hearing procedures and will not be in conflict with the ordinance designating the Planning Commission as the Board, the applicable state statutes and the provisions of these regulations. Such bylaws shall be subject to the approval of the Governing Body. The Governing Body shall establish a scale of reasonable fees to be paid in advance by the appealing party.
102 Jurisdiction.
The Board shall have the following jurisdiction and authority as a quasi-judicial body:
A. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination (all hereinafter referred to collectively as "decision") made by the Zoning Administrator in the administration and enforcement of these regulations subject to the procedure and standards set out in Section 10-106.
B. To hear and decide on variances from specific terms of these regulations subject to the procedure and standards set out in Section 10-107.
C. To hear and decide on conditional uses as exceptions subject to the procedure and standards set out in Section 10-108.
103 Notice of Hearing.
For the hearing on each appeal for a decision, variance or conditional use; public notice of the date, time and place of the hearing, the legal description or a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration, and a brief description of the subject of such hearing shall be published once in the official newspaper so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 10 Page 114
for the hearing. All notices shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection and shall indicate where such information is available when only a general description of the property is provided in the notice. A copy of such notice shall be mailed to each party making the appeal and to the Secretary of the Planning Commission.
For land inside the city limits, the Board shall also provide notice to all owners of record of real property located within 200 feet of the exterior boundary of the property under consideration both within the city limits and extending outside the city limits when necessary. If the applicant's property is located adjacent to but within the city limits, the area of notification in addition to the 200 feet inside the City and 200 feet into any other nearby city., shall be extended to 1,000 feet in the unincorporated area. Such notice shall be mailed so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the mailing date and the hearing date. A list of such owners of record of real property with their addresses and zip codes shall be provided by the applicant. Failure to receive such notice after it has been properly addressed and deposited in the mail shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Board. If there is no quorum present for the meeting or at the time of the hearing, the members in attendance may agree to hold another meeting in the future at a stated date, time and place for which, when announced at the present meeting, no further public notice need be given.
The Board may give additional notice to other persons as it may from time to time provide by its rules. Such rules may include requirements for additional notice to be provided for by the posting of signs on the property to be considered in the appeal application.
104 Conduct of Hearing.
The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing on each appeal of a decision, variance or conditional use as an exception. All hearings shall be open to the public; however, when hearing such appeals the Board exercises quasi-judicial functions and, thus, may upon proper motion proceed to deliberate in closed session according to K.S.A. 75-4318(a). No binding action may be taken and all voting must be conducted in an open meeting. Any person may appear and testify at a hearing, either in person or by a duly authorized agent or attorney. Every decision of the Board shall be filed without unreasonable delay with the Zoning Administrator and shall be open to public inspection during reasonable business hours.
105 Finality and Judicial Review of Decisions.
Any order or determination of the Board on an appeal for a decision, a variance or a conditional use as an exception, shall be final decisions and shall be subject to judicial review, but not appealable to the Planning Commission or the Governing Body. Any person, official or governmental agency, jointly or separately dissatisfied by any decision of the Board, may present to the County District Court, a petition, duly verified, stating that such decision is illegal in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality and asking for relief therefrom based on a determination of the reasonableness of any such order or determination. Such petition shall be filed with the Court within 30 days after the date of filing the final decision with the Zoning Administrator.
106 Appeals.
An appeal from a decision of the Zoning Administrator with respect to the interpretation, application or enforcement of these regulations may be taken to the Board by any person aggrieved, or by any officer of the City, or any governmental agency or body affected by any decision of the Zoning Administrator.
A. Time for Appeals. Appeals shall be made within 30 days after a decision has been made by the Zoning Administrator by filing an application for appeal. Upon the Chairperson's
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 10 Page 115
receipt of an application for appeal and notification to the Zoning Administrator, the Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Chairperson all of the papers constituting the record upon which the decision being appealed was based.
B. Application. An application for an appeal shall (1) be filed with the Chairperson, (2) specify the grounds for such an appeal, (3) include the legal description of any property involved with the appeal, (4) be accompanied by an ownership list as required by Section 10-103 and the filing fee, and (5) provide such additional information as may be prescribed by rule of the Board.
C. Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board, after the application for appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, the proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on petition with notice to the Zoning Administrator and on the basis of due cause shown.
D. Hearing and Notice. A hearing on the application for such an appeal shall be held and notice thereof given as specified under Sections 10-103 and 104 and which are consistent with the general procedures and records required by Section 10-101.
E. Decision. The Board may affirm or reverse, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the Zoning Administrator, and may issue or direct the issuance of a zoning permit and/or occupancy certificate. No conditions may be attached to such a decision that could not otherwise have been available to the Zoning Administrator in making his initial decision. The Board shall render a written decision in the form of a resolution on the appeal without unreasonable delay after the close of the public portion of the hearing.
107 Variances.
The Board may authorize such variances from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest and provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Variances may be authorized only in those specific instances enumerated in Section 10-107C and then only when the Board has made findings of fact based upon the standards set out in Section 10-107D that owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship for the owner, lessee or occupant of land or structures. According to K.S.A. 12-759(e), any such variance shall not permit any use not permitted by these regulations in the zoning district in which the variance is requested.
A. Application. An application for a variance shall (1) be filed with the Zoning Administrator, (2) provide the legal description of the property involved with the variance, (3) be accompanied by an ownership list as required by Section 10-103 and the filing fee, and (4) contain the following information as well as such additional information as may be prescribed by rule of the Board:
1. The particular requirements of these regulations which prevent the proposed use or construction;
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 10 Page 116
2. The characteristics of the subject property which prevent compliance with the requirements of these regulations;
3. The reduction of the minimum requirements of these regulations which would be necessary to permit the proposed use or construction; and
4. The particular hardship which would result if the particular requirements of these regulations were applied to the subject property.
5. Submit a sketch drawn to scale showing the lot(s) included in the application, the structures existing thereon and the structures proposed that necessitate the request.
B. Hearing and Notice. A hearing on the application for such a variance shall be held and notice thereof given as specified under Sections 10-103 and 104 and which are consistent with the general procedures and records required by Section 10-101.
C. Authorized. Variances from the provisions of these regulations shall be granted by the Board only in accordance with the standards set out in Section 10-107D, and may be granted only in the following instances and in no others:
1. To vary the applicable minimum lot area, lot width and lot depth requirements.
2. To vary the applicable bulk regulations, including maximum height and lot coverage and minimum yard requirements.
3. To vary the dimensional provisions for permitted obstructions in required yards including fences in Section 3-103F.
4. To vary the applicable number of required off-street parking spaces and the amount of off-street loading requirements of Article 5.
5. To vary the applicable dimensional sign provisions of Section 7-102 regarding general standards and Section 7-104 regarding district regulations.
6. To vary the applicable requirements in Sections 10-107C1 through 5 above in conjunction with conditional use applications for nonconforming, nonresidential structures and uses under provisions of Section 8-105.
7. To vary the applicable provisions permitted by the FP Floodplain District. (See Appendix for FP Floodplain District.)
D. Standards:
1. The Board may grant a variance upon specific written findings of fact based upon the particular evidence presented to it at the hearing that all the conditions required by K.S.A. 12-759(e) have been met which are listed below:
a. That the variance requested arises from such condition which is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zoning district, and is not created by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant;
b. That granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 10 Page 117
c. That strict application of the provisions of these regulations from which a variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;
d. That the variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity or general welfare; and
e. That granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of these regulations.
2. In determining whether the evidence supports the conclusions required by Section 10-107D1, the Board shall consider the extent to which the evidence demonstrates that:
a. The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon or for the owner, lessee or occupant, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the provisions of these regulations were literally enforced;
b. he request for a variance is not based exclusively upon a desire of the owner, lessee, occupant or applicant to make more money out of the property;
c. The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located; and
d. The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion on public streets or roads, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
C. Conditions and Restrictions. In granting a variance, the Board may impose such conditions upon the premises benefited by the variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in Section 10-107D which would reduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of these regulations, including methods for guaranteeing performance such as are provided for in Section 10-108D. Failure to comply with any of the conditions for a variance which are later attached to a zoning permit shall constitute a violation of these regulations. If an applicant desires to make a change in a condition date, it is necessary to apply for a rehearing and a decision be made in the same manner as the original variance; however, only the requested condition is to be reconsidered at the hearing.
D. Decisions and Records. The Board shall render a written decision containing specific findings of fact in the form of a resolution on an application for a variance without unreasonable delay after the close of a hearing. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain complete records of all actions of the Board with respect to applications for variances in order to properly issue permits.
E. Period of Validity. No variance granted by the Board shall be valid for a period longer than 180 days from the date on which the Board grants the variance, unless within such 180-
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 10 Page 118
day period a zoning permit is obtained and the variance requested is started. The Board may grant extensions not exceeding 180 days each, upon written application, without further notice or hearing.
108 Conditional Uses.
The Board may grant as an exception to the provisions of these regulations, the establishment of only those conditional uses that are expressly authorized to be permitted in a particular zoning district or in one or more zoning districts. No such conditional use shall be granted unless it complies with all of the applicable provisions of these regulations.
A. Application. An application for a conditional use shall (1) be filed with the Zoning Administrator, (2) provide the legal description of the property involved with the conditional use, (3) be accompanied by an ownership list as required by Section 10-103 and the filing fee, and (4) contain the following information as well as such additional information as may be prescribed by rule of the Board:
1. A statement or diagram showing compliance with any special conditions or requirements imposed upon the particular conditional use by the applicable district regulations or Section 10-108D if applicable;
2. A statement as to why the proposed conditional use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood;
3. A statement as to how the proposed conditional use is to be designed, arranged and operated in order to permit the development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district regulations; and
4. Present data in support of the standards specified in Section 10-108C.
B. Hearing and Notice. A hearing on the application for such a conditional use as an exception shall be held and notice thereof given as specified under Sections 10-103 and 104 and which are consistent with the general procedures and records required by Section 10-101.
C. Standards. The Board may grant a conditional use when it makes specific written findings of fact based upon the particular evidence presented to it at the hearing which support conclusions that:
1. The proposed conditional use complies with all applicable regulations, including lot size requirements, bulk regulations, use limitations and performance standards; unless a concurrent application is in process for a variance.
2. The proposed conditional use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood.
3. The location and size of the conditional use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it are such that the conditional use will not dominate the immediate neighborhood so as to prevent development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable zoning district regulations. In determining whether the conditional use will so dominate the immediate neighborhood, consideration shall be given to:
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 10 Page 119
a. The location, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls and fences on the site; and
b. The nature and extent of landscaping and screening on the site.
4. Off-street parking and loading areas will be provided in accordance with the standards set forth in Article 5 of these regulations. Such areas will be screened from adjoining residential uses and located so as to protect such residential uses from injurious effects.
5. Adequate utility, drainage and other such necessary facilities have been installed or will be provided by platting, dedications and/or guarantees.
6. Adequate access roads, entrance and exit drives and/or access control is available or will be provided by platting, dedications and/or guarantees and shall be so designed to prevent traffic hazards, to minimize traffic congestion in public streets and to provide proper access for police and fire protection.
D. Conditions. In granting a conditional use, the Board may attach such conditions upon the premises and/or the applicant benefited by the conditional use as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in Section 10-108C in order to reduce or minimize any potentially injurious affect upon other property in the neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of these regulations. Such conditions may include, but not be limited to, further restrictions on bulk regulations; time of operation and ownership limitations; screening, landscaping and fencing; provision of utilities, drainage and other public improvements; additional access or access control; off-street parking and loading requirements; and platting, dedications and/or guarantees. In addition to the guarantees referred to below for parking and/or screening, covenants which run with the land or the property to guarantee that conditions will be carried out at a future date may be filed with the County Register of Deeds. Failure to comply with any of the conditions for a conditional use which are later attached to a zoning permit shall constitute a violation of these regulations. If an applicant desires to make a change in a condition at a later date, it is necessary to apply for a rehearing and a decision made in the same manner as the original conditional use; however, only the condition requested is to be reconsidered at the hearing.
In lieu of actual construction of required off-street parking or the initial provisions for screening, the Board may accept, in the name of the City, a corporate surety bond, cashier's check, escrow account or other like security in an amount to be fixed by the Board and conditioned upon actual completion of such improvement within a specified time. Such securities shall be filed with the Clerk. The Governing Body may enforce such securities by all equitable means.
E. Decisions and Records. The Board shall render a written decision containing specific findings of fact in the form of a resolution on an application for a conditional use without unreasonable delay after the close of a hearing, but in all cases within 45 days after the close of the hearing. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain complete records of all actions of the Board with respect to applications for conditional uses in order to properly issue permits.
F. Period of Validity. No conditional use granted by the Board shall be valid for a period longer than 180 days from the date on which the Board grants the conditional use, unless
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 10 Page 120
within such period a zoning permit is obtained and the conditional use requested is started. The Board may grant extensions not exceeding 180 days each, upon written application, without further notice of a hearing.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 11 Page 121
ARTICLE 11. AMENDMENTS
100 General Provisions for Amendments and Special Uses.
These regulations and the districts created under the authority of these regulations may be amended from time to time by the Planning Commission following a public hearing and the approval by the Governing Body. No such amendment shall be adopted except in accordance with the procedures of this Article 11. Special use applications are not amendments, but are processed in the same manner. The Official Zoning Map(s) is not amended. (See Section 11-101 for special uses.)
A. Proposal. Amendments or special uses may be proposed: (1) by the Governing Body, (2) by the Planning Commission or (3) upon application by, or on behalf of the owner of the property affected, but only in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 11-100B. When the Governing Body proposes an amendment or special use, it shall transmit its proposal to the Planning Commission for a public hearing and recommendation thereon. (See Section 11-100D3 for special notice of hearing procedure for Governing Body and Planning Commission applications.)
B. Application. When the owner of the property affected proposes an amendment to any of these regulations or to any zoning district created thereby, an application shall (1) be filed with the Zoning Administrator who refers it to the Planning Commission for a hearing, (2) be in such form and contain such information as shall be prescribed from time to time by the Commission, and (3) in all instances contain the following information:
1. The precise wording of any proposed amendment of these regulations or the exact description of the special use requested.
2. In the event that the proposed application would change the zoning district classification or apply for a special use for any specific property:
a. The name, address and telephone number of the owner of the property and, if any, the agent representing the owner;
b. The legal description of the property and a general description such as a street address sufficient to identify the property;
c. The present and proposed zoning district classifications and existing uses of the property and structures thereon;
d. The dimensions of the property and the zoning lot area stated in square feet or acres or fractions thereof; and
e. For land inside the city limits, an ownership list of the names, addresses and zip codes of the owners of record of real property located within 200 feet of the exterior boundary of the area described in the application both within the city limits and extending outside the city limits when necessary. If such area is located adjacent to the city limits, the ownership list, in addition to the 200 feet inside the city limits, shall provide similar information extending to 1,000 feet into the unincorporated area. If such area is located outside the city limits, the ownership list shall extend for 1,000 feet in the unincorporated area and, if the latter extends into the
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 11 Page 122
city limits, then property owners for 200 feet inside the city must also be included on the list. If either of these notification distances extend into another city, such owners for 200 feet in that area must be included on the list.
C. Public Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on each proposed amendment that is filed with, referred to, or initiated by the Commission. The Commission shall select a reasonable time and place for such public hearing, and it shall hold such hearing within 45 days from the date on which the proposed amendment is received or initiated. An applicant for an amendment may waive the requirement that such hearing be held within 45 days.
D. Notice of Hearing. One of the following three procedures shall be selected to provide proper notice for a public hearing for any zoning amendment application:
1. Public notice of a hearing by the Planning Commission on a proposed amendment shall be published once in the official newspaper by the Zoning Administrator. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date set for such hearing. Such notice shall state the date, time and place of the hearing and shall contain a statement regarding the proposed changes in regulations or the zoning classification or zoning district boundaries of any property. If the proposed amendment would change the zoning classification of any specific property or the boundaries of any zoning district, such notice shall contain the legal description or a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration. If a general description is used, the notice shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection and where such description is available.
In addition to such publication notice, the Zoning Administrator shall mail a written notice of the hearing containing information similar to the published notice thereof to the applicant and to the owners of record of all real property within the area to be altered or changed and to all owners of record of real property located within 200 feet of the exterior boundary of the area described in the amendment application both within the city limits and extending outside the city limits when necessary. If such area is located adjacent to but within the city limits, the area of notification shall, in addition to the 200 feet inside the city limits, be extended to 1,000 feet in the unincorporated area. If such area is located outside the city limits, the area of notification shall extend for 1,000 feet and, if such notification extends into the city limits, then 200 feet inside the city limits must also be included. If any of these notification distances extend into another city, such owners for 200 feet in that area must also be notified. The notice to property owners including the applicant shall be mailed so that 20 days shall elapse between the mailing date and the hearing date. When the notice has been properly addressed and deposited in the mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Commission or the Governing Body.
2. Whenever five or more owners of record of real property owning 10 or more contiguous or noncontiguous lots, tracts or parcels of the same zoning classification initiate a rezoning of their property from a less restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification, such amendment shall require notice by
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 11 Page 123
publication only and hearing in like manner as required by Section 11-100C. Such zoning amendment shall not require written notice and shall not be subject to the protest petition provision of Section 11-103.
3. Whenever the Governing Body or the Planning Commission initiates a rezoning from a less restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification of 10 or more contiguous or noncontiguous lots, tracts or parcels of the same zoning classification having five or more owners of record of real property, such amendment shall require notice by publication and hearing in like manner as that required by Section 11-100C. In addition, written notice shall be required to be mailed to only owners of record of real properties to be rezoned and only such owners shall be eligible to initiate a protest petition under Section 11-103.
The Commission may give such additional notice to other persons as it may from time to time provide by its rules. Such rules may include requirements for additional notice to be provided for by the posting of signs on the land to be considered in the amendment application.
E. Conduct of Hearing.
1. All hearings that these regulations require the Planning Commission to conduct for amendments to changes in the text of the regulations or the zoning classifications or in district boundaries shall be open public meetings according to K.S.A. 75-4317 et seq., the Open Meetings Act. When a proposed amendment will affect the zoning classification or district boundary of specific property, however, the Commission acts in a quasi-judicial capacity and, thus, may upon proper motion proceed to deliberate in closed session according to K.S.A. 75-4318(a). No binding action can be taken in such a session and all voting must be conducted in an open meeting.
2. Any interested person or party may appear and be heard at the hearing in person, by agent or by attorney.
3. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the proceedings shall be preserved in such a manner and according to such procedures as the Commission may from time to time prescribe by rule or bylaws which are not in conflict with these regulations or applicable state statutes.
4. The Commission shall keep minutes of the proceedings showing evidence presented at hearings, findings of fact by the Commission, motions made and the vote of each member upon any question or recommendation. If a member is absent, abstains or disqualified, such fact shall be indicated.
5. The Commission may request a report on any proposed amendment from any governmental official or agency, or any other person, firm or corporation. If such a report is made, a copy thereof shall be made available to the applicant and any other interested person prior to or at the public hearing.
6. The Commission may make recommendations on proposed amendments to specific properties which affect only a portion of the land described in the hearing notice or which give all or any part of the land described a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice. A recommendation for a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice shall not be valid,
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 11 Page 124
however, without re-publication and, where necessary, re-mailing of notices, unless the Commission shall have previously established a table or publication available to the public which designates what zoning classifications are lesser changes authorized within the published zoning classifications. (See Appendix p. A-1 for Table of Comparability for Zoning Districts.)
7. For action on zoning amendments, a quorum of the Commission must be more than one-half of the membership as established by ordinance. A majority of the members of the Commission present and voting at the hearing shall be required to recommend approval or disapproval of the amendment to the Governing Body. If the Commission fails to make a recommendation on a rezoning request, the Commission shall be deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval.
8. A hearing may be adjourned from time to time upon a motion to continue in the future at some stated date, time and place. At the conclusion of the public portion of a hearing, the Commission shall prepare its findings and the factors on which to base its recommendation and vote.
9. If a meeting is called or a hearing is on the agenda and no quorum is present, the members in attendance may agree to hold the hearing at another meeting in the future at a stated date, time and place or at the next regular meeting for which, when announced at the present scheduled meeting, no further public notice need be given to continue the hearing.
F. Report by Planning Commission. Within 14 days after the close of the public portion of the hearing and voting on a proposed amendment or special use, the Planning Commission shall submit a report to the Governing Body. A copy of this report shall also be filed with the Clerk and the Zoning Administrator and such copies shall be kept available for public inspection. A copy of the report shall also be mailed to the applicant. Such report shall contain a recommendation as to whether the proposed amendment or special use should be approved or disapproved and specific written determinations on the items listed in Sections 11-100H and on such other items as the Commission may consider relevant. The report submitted to the Governing Body shall be accompanied by a summary of the hearing as required by K.S.A. 12-756(b). In lieu of a report, the above information may be contained in the minutes of the meeting and submitted to the Governing Body.
G. Amendments to Text. When a proposed amendment by the Governing Body or Planning Commission would result in a change or revision in the text of these regulations, but would not result in a change of zoning classification of any specific property, a legislative hearing shall be held by the Commission and the report shall contain a statement as to the nature and effect of such proposed amendment and determinations as to the following items:
1. Whether such change is consistent with the intent and purposes of these regulations; and
2. Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or changing conditions in the zoning districts affected and, if so, the nature of such changed or changing conditions.
H. Review Criteria for Amendments or Special Uses. When a proposed rezoning amendment or special use would result in a zoning change for any specific property, the report of the
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 11 Page 125
Planning Commission accompanied by a summary of the hearing shall contain statements as to (1) the present and proposed district classifications or description of the special use, (2) the applicant's reasons for requesting such reclassification or special use, and (3) a statement of the factors where relevant upon which the recommendation of the Commission is based using the following criteria as guidelines:11
1. What are the existing uses, their character and condition on the subject property and in the surrounding neighborhood?
2. What is the current zoning of the subject property and that of the surrounding neighborhood in relationship to the requested change?
3. Is the length of time that the subject property has remained undeveloped or vacant as zoned a factor in the consideration?
4. Would the request correct an error in the application of these regulations?
5. Is the request caused by changed or changing conditions in the area of the subject property and, if so, what is the nature and significance of such changed or changing conditions?
6. Do adequate sewage disposal and water supply and all other necessary public facilities including street access exist or can they be provided to serve the uses that would be permitted on the subject property?
7. Would the subject property need to be platted or replatted or in lieu of dedications made for rights-of-way, easements, access control or building setback lines?
8. Would a screening plan be necessary for existing and/or potential uses of the subject property?
9. Is suitable vacant land or buildings available or not available for development that currently has the same zoning as is requested?
10. If the request is for business or industrial uses, are such uses needed to provide more services or employment opportunities?
11. Is the subject property suitable for the current zoning to which it has been restricted?
12. To what extent would the removal of the restrictions i.e. the approval of the zoning request detrimentally affect other property in the neighborhood?
13. Would the request be consistent with the purpose of the zoning district classification and the intent and purpose of these regulations?
14. Is the request in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan and does it further enhance the implementation of the Plan?
15. What is the support or opposition to the request?
11 NOTE: All the factors stated in the decision of Golden v. City of Overland Park, 224 Kan. 591, 584 P.2d 130 (1978) are included in this list. In using these factors as guidelines, modifications may be made in the criteria to more specifically relate them to the particular zoning change in classification or special use.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 11 Page 126
16. Is there any information or are there any recommendations on this request available from knowledgeable persons or experts which would be helpful in its evaluation?
17. By comparison, does the relative gain to the public health, safety or general welfare outweigh the loss in property value or the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not approving the request?
Of those factors considered as relevant to the requested change in zoning district classification or boundary or special use, not all factors need to be given equal consideration by the Commission in deciding upon its recommendation.
101 Special Uses.
Because of particular factors associated with their activities, certain uses which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future development of a district are not permitted outright in districts, but are permitted as "special uses" when their proposed location is supplemented by additional conditions such as to make the use considered compatible with the surrounding property, the neighborhood and the zoning district.
In granting a special use, the minimum requirements of approval for all similar types of permitted uses in the same district must be met, unless otherwise reduced by a specific reference in these regulations. The requirements may be made more stringent if there is potentially injurious effects which may be anticipated upon other property and the neighborhood or contrary to the welfare and convenience of the public. Such additional conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirements affecting the lot size or yard dimensions; changing street width; the extent and location of entrance or exit drives; controlling the size, location and number of signs; the period and time of operation; lot coverage and height of buildings; screening, fencing and/or landscaping to protect the surrounding property; establishing environmental standards for air and water pollution, noise, vibration, lighting and other such conditions; protection from flooding; and additional improvements such as street construction, sidewalks, utilities and storm drainage, if necessary, including platting and/or dedications. Such conditions may be placed upon the property which is the subject of the special use application or upon the applicant or both.
Although the Official Zoning Map(s) is not amended, the procedure for approval of a special use shall otherwise be the same as for an amendment to change a zoning district classification or boundary which is set forth in Section 11-100 of this Article including the provisions for filing protest petitions in Section 11-103; provided, that any additional requirements which are further imposed upon the special use shall be made a part of the effectuating ordinance. Applications for special uses shall be accompanied by a plot plan of the proposed development. Concurrent applications may be processed for changing zoning district classifications as amendments and approving special uses on the same property wherein joint notices are advertised and mailed; however, separate hearings are held, review criteria, motions and effectuating ordinances are necessary.
Failure to comply with any of the conditions for a special use which is later attached to a zoning permit, shall constitute a violation of these regulation. If an applicant desires to make a change in a condition at a later date, it is necessary to apply for a rehearing and a decision be made in the same manner as the original special use; however, only the requested condition is to be reconsidered at the hearing.
No special use approval by the Governing Body shall be valid for a period longer than one year from the publication date of the effectuating ordinance unless (1) another time period is designated as a condition attached to the special use; or (2) an application is filed and a zoning permit is approved during the period of validity. In such instance the special use shall be valid for the period of validity of the zoning permit. The
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 11 Page 127
Governing Body may authorize extensions of the validity period without notice or public hearing for more than one year upon a written request received within a valid period. Upon expiration of any validity period, the effectuating ordinance automatically becomes null and void unless an extension has been granted or a zoning permit has been obtained during the validity period.
102 Project Review.
In the event that certain public improvements, facilities or utilities of a type embraced within the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan are classified as special uses or are the subject of a change in zoning district classification or boundary, the consideration of such uses by the Planning Commission in conjunction with a zoning application may also constitute their project review of such proposed use if concurrently processed under procedures required by K.S.A. 12-748, as amended; provided, that a statement of findings is included in the Commission's approval or disapproval as to whether such proposed use is or is not in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. In case the Commission finds that the proposed use is not in conformance to the Plan and states in writing the manner in which it is not in conformance, then the Governing Body shall not proceed with construction of such a proposed use unless the Governing Body by a majority vote overrides the disapproval of the Commission and the Plan shall be deemed to have been amended and the Commission shall make the necessary changes in the Plan to reflect the vote of the Governing Body.
103 Filing of Protest.
Whether or not the Planning Commission approves or disapproves a zoning change, if a written protest petition against a proposed amendment for a specific property or a special use shall be filed in the office of the Clerk within 14 days after the date of the conclusion of the hearing by the Commission which is signed and an accurate legal description of their property provided by the owners of record of 20% or more of any real property proposed to be altered or changed, excluding streets or public ways, or by the owners of record of 20% or more of the real property within the total area required in the official area of notification by Section 11-100D, excluding streets and public ways and specific statutorily excluded property as described below; then the effectuating ordinance shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 vote of all the members of the City Council.
Property statutorily excluded by K.S.A 12-757(f) from determining the sufficiency of a protest petition when calculating the total real property within the notification area is that which was (1) requested by the owner of the specific property for rezoning or a special use; or (2) the owner of the specific property requested for rezoning or a special use who does not oppose in writing such rezoning or special use. (See Sections 11-100 D2 and D3 for protest petition exceptions for rezoning from a lesser restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification.)
104 Adoption of Amendments or Special Uses by the Governing Body.
When the Planning Commission in its report submits a recommendation of approval or disapproval of a proposed amendment or special use including the basis therefore, the Governing Body may: (1) Adopt such recommendation by an effectuating ordinance; (2) override the Commission's recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the membership of the Governing Body; or (3) return such recommendation to the Commission with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to approve or disapprove. If the Governing Body returns the Commission's recommendation, the Commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendation giving the reasons therefore or submit a new or amended recommendation. Upon the receipt of such recommendation, the Governing Body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendation by the effectuating ordinance or it need take no further action thereon. If the Commission fails to deliver its
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 11 Page 128
recommendation to the Governing Body following the Commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the Governing Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendation and proceed accordingly.
In considering its decision under each of the above set of circumstances, the Governing Body shall take into account the guidelines in Section 11-100H which are relevant to the proposed amendment or special use and, having reviewed the Commission's findings of fact and the factors upon which their recommendation is based, the Governing Body either adopts the Commission's findings and factors by reference or records their own findings of fact and the factors upon which their decision is based.
The proposed amendment or special use shall become effective upon publication of the respective adopting ordinance. If such an amendment affects the classification or boundaries of any zoning district, the respective ordinance shall legally describe the classification or boundaries as amended, shall order the official zoning map to be changed to reflect such amendment, and shall reincorporate such map as amended.
105 Annual Review.
In order to maintain these regulations including the Official Zoning Map(s), the Planning Commission shall annually hold a public review at their first regular meeting in October to consider amendments, if any, to these regulations. Preceding such a review, the Governing Body, other affected governmental agencies, and interested private organizations and individuals should be notified of the intent to review and their ideas requested. In preparation for such a review, the Zoning Administrator shall maintain a master copy of the current zoning regulations on which are recorded comments and ideas brought to the attention of the Administrator during the preceding year in order to maintain the intent and purpose of the zoning regulations under changing conditions and to implement the Comprehensive Plan. Information on any relevant changes in state statutes shall be complied for the review.
106 Judicial Review.
As provided by K.S.A. 12-760, as amended, any ordinance, regulation, amendment, special use or other zoning decision provided for or authorized by these regulations shall be reasonable and any person aggrieved thereby may have the reasonableness of any decision determined by bringing an action against the City within 30 days after a final decision is made by the City. In the event that an amendment to these regulations or a special use is approved by the Governing Body, the 30-day period commences when the effectuating ordinance is published. Such action shall be brought in the Sedgwick County District Court.
According to K.S.A. 12-757(a), if a proposed amendment is not a general revision of the existing regulations and affects specific property, such an amendment shall be presumed to be reasonable if it is in accordance with the land use plan or the land use element of the comprehensive plan.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Article 12 Page 129
ARTICLE 12. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE
100 Severability.
If any provisions of these regulations are held to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be considered separately and apart from the remaining provisions of these regulations, so as to be completely severable and the remaining provisions of these regulations shall remain in full force and effect.

APPENDIX
TABLE OF COMPARABILITY FOR ZONING DISTRICTS
In accordance with provisions provided for in K.S.A. 12-757(b) and in Section 11-100E6 of the Zoning Regulations of the City of Park City, Kansas, the Planning Commission hereby establishes a "Table of Comparability for Zoning Districts" as listed below. This table designates the zoning districts which are considered to be "lesser changes" due to their more restrictive characteristics as set forth in the Zoning Regulations.
When considering zoning district amendments, the Planning Commission and the Governing Body may recommend and approve a lesser change in zoning districts for the property already advertised for a public hearing without republication of a notice or redistribution of notices to property owners when such change is more restrictive than the district which is applied for as shown on the table below; provided, however, that such recommendation and approval shall not be for a lesser classification than the existing zoning district. If the applicant at the Governing Body meeting at which a zoning amendment is being considered desires to amend the application and/or the Governing Body desires to consider a "lesser" zoning change, then such a proposed change shall be returned to the Planning Commission for reconsideration and further recommendation to the Governing Body without further publication or notice as provided for in K.S.A. 12-757(c) and in Section 11-104 of the Zoning Regulations.
MOST RESTRICTIVE:
A-1 Agricultural District
R-1 Single-Family Residential District
R-2 Single-Family Residential District
R-3 Multiple-Family Residential District
C-2 Service Business District
I-1 Light Industrial District
LEAST RESTRICTIVE:
I-2 Heavy Industrial District
Because of the uniqueness and special purpose for which the MH-1 Manufactured Home Park District, C-1 Central Business District, GC General Commercial District, E-1 Entertainment District, and P-O Protective Overlay District serve, these districts are excluded from the Table of Comparability as well as the overlay zone established by the FP Floodplain District.
Although the notification for a "Special Use" is processed in the same manner as a zoning district amendment, it is not an actual change in zoning districts and, therefore, the Table of Comparability does not apply and reapplication is necessary for consideration of a different "Use" even if in the same zone. Part of the property considered for a Special Use, however, may be withdrawn by the applicant or a lesser amount recommended for approval without re-notification.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Appendix Page 132
EXAMPLE: If an application is advertised for a public hearing requesting a change from R-1 Single-Family Residential District to I-1 Light Industrial District, the Planning Commission may recommend the lesser, i.e., more restrictive C-2 Business District without republication or mailing of new notices.
If an application, however, is advertised for a public hearing requesting a change from the existing C-2 Business District to the I-1 Industrial District, the recommending of the lesser R-1 or R-2 districts shall not be valid without republication and the mailing of new notices.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Appendix Page 133
FP Floodplain District.
Certain areas of the City are periodically subject to flooding which can result in losses due to: (1) the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages. This Floodplain District is designed to permit the gainful use of certain lands which are considered to be in the path of potential flood waters and from which structures and other valuable property use that is subject to damage by flood water should be excluded. This would permit surface runoff through such areas in the event of heavy stream flow with a minimum of structural damage or property loss and a minimum of obligation upon the governmental authorities for flood assistance. More specifically, the purpose of this overlay zoning district is to:
(1) Prohibit the placement of structures, fill and materials which would unduly impede or obstruct flood Flows.
(2) Protect human life and health, prevent property damage, minimize business interruptions and minimize and facilitate rescue and relief efforts, which generally must be undertaken at public expense.
(3) Minimize expenditures of public monies for costly flood control projects and minimize the damage to public facilities in the floodplain, such as water mains, sewer lines, streets and bridges.
(4) Minimize flood blight areas and maintain property values and a stable tax base adjacent to the floodplain.
(5) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction.
(6) Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard.
(7) Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the City to purchase flood insurance in the Federal Flood Insurance Program.

Substantial Damage includes Repetitive Loss buildings (See REPETITIVE LOSS).
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a “historic structure.”
TEMPORARY STRUCTURE means a structure permitted in a district for a period not to exceed 180 days and is required to be removed upon the expiration of the permit period. Temporary structures may include recreational vehicles, temporary construction offices, or temporary business facilities used until permanent facilities can be constructed, but at no time shall it include manufactured homes used as residences.
VARIANCE means a grant of relief by the community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. Flood insurance requirements remain in place for any varied use or structure and cannot be varied by the community.
VIOLATION means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplain.
B. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSES
1. APPROVAL OF CHIEF ENGINEER. The following floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved in draft form by the Chief Engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture on January 3, 2007.
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Appendix Page 140
2. KANSAS STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. The Legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et seq, and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare.
3. FINDINGS OF FACT.
(a) The special flood hazard areas of the City of Park City, Kansas, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b) These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(c) The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this ordinance uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series of interrelated steps.
1). Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is representative of large floods, which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated February 2, 2007 as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
2). Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over-bank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
3). Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
4). Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height.
5). Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood.
4. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described hereinabove; to establish or maintain the community’s eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this ordinance to:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Appendix Page 141
b. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
c. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.
C. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES. This Chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Park City identified as numbered and unnumbered A, AE, and AH Zones, on the Index Map dated February 2, 2007 of the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and the Index Map dated February 2, 2007 of the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this Chapter, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the Park City, City Council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the Park City, City Council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in Article 4.
2. COMPLIANCE. No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and other applicable regulations.
3. ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS. It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this Chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
4. INTERPRETATION. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by Kansas statutes.
5. WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This Chapter shall not create a liability on the part of Park City, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.
6. SEVERABILITY. If any section; clause; provision; or portion of this Chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall not be affected thereby.
D. ADMINISTRATION
1. FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. A floodplain development permit shall be required for all proposed construction or other development, including the placement of manufactured homes, in the areas described in Article 2 above. No person, firm, corporation, or unit of government shall initiate any

E. PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
A. GENERAL STANDARDS.
(a) No permit for floodplain development shall be granted for new construction, substantial improvement, and other improvements, including the placement of manufactured homes, within any numbered or unnumbered A, AE, and AH zones, unless the conditions of this section are satisfied.
(b) All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the 100-year flood; however, the base flood elevation is not provided. Development within unnumbered A zones is subject to all provisions of this ordinance. If Flood Insurance Study data is not available, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other sources.
(c) Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development, including fill, shall be permitted within any unnumbered or numbered A zones, or AE zones on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
(d) All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvement, prefabricated structures, placement of manufactured homes, and other developments shall require:
1. Design or adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
2. Construction with materials resistant to flood damage;
3. Utilization of methods and practices that minimize flood damages;
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Appendix Page 144
4. All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning equipment, and other service facilities be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
5. New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and on-site waste disposal systems be located so as to avoid impairment or contamination; and
6. Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, located within special flood hazard areas are required to assure that:
(i) All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(ii) All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage;
(iii) Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
(iv) All proposals for development, including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, of five (5) acres or fifty (50) lots, whichever is lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data.
(e) The storage or processing of materials within the special flood hazard area that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods, if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning.
(f) A structure, or the use of a structure or premises that was lawful before the adoption of this Chapter, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this Chapter, may be continued subject to the following conditions:
1. If such structure, use, or utility service is discontinued for 6 consecutive months, any future use of the building shall conform to this Chapter.
2. If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty (50) percent of the pre-damaged market value of the structure. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building, safety codes, regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination.
(g) Structures used solely for agricultural purposes in connection with the production, harvesting, storage, drying, or raising of agricultural commodities, including the raising of livestock, may be constructed at-grade and wet-flood proofed provided there is no human habitation or occupancy of the structure; the structure is of single-wall design; there is no permanent retail, whole-sale, or
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Appendix Page 145
manufacturing use included in the structure; a variance has been granted from the floodplain management requirements of this Chapter; and a floodplain development permit has been issued.
(h) Structures used solely for parking and limited storage purposes, not attached to any other structure on the site, of limited investment value, and not larger than 400 square feet, may be constructed at grade and wet-flood proofed provided there is no human habitation or occupancy of the structure; the structure is of single-wall design; a variance has been granted from the standard floodplain management requirements of this ordinance; and a floodplain development permit has been issued.

A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in Article 3.
All critical facilities shall have access routes that are above the elevation of the 500-year flood.
No critical facilities shall be constructed in any designated floodway.
(j) All hazardous material storage and handling sites shall be located out of the special flood hazard area.
(k) A structure may be improved (remodeled or enlarged) without conforming to current requirements for elevation so long as the cumulative value of all work done within the last five calendar years does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the structure's current market value. If the cumulative value of the improvement exceeds fifty (50) percent of the structure's current market value, the structure must be brought into compliance with Article 4 that requires elevation of residential structures to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or the elevation/flood proofing of non-residential structures to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
2. SPECIFIC STANDARDS. In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A, AE, and AH Zones, where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in Article 4, the following provisions are required:
(a) New construction or substantial improvements of any residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above base flood elevation. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor.
(b) New construction or substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or, together with
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Appendix Page 146
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be flood proofed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in Article 3.
(c) For all new construction and substantial improvement, that fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
1 A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and
2 The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
3. MANUFACTURED HOMES.
(a) All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A, AE, and AH zones, on the community's FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
(b) Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or numbered A, AE, and AH zones, on the community's FIRM on sites outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to and existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor.
(c) Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A, AE and AH zones, on the community's FIRM, that are not subject to the provisions of Article 4, Section C (2) of this ordinance, be elevated so that either:
1. The lowest floor of the manufactured home is a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood level; or
2. The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height
City of Park City Zoning Regulations – Appendix Page 147
above grade and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor.
4. AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AH zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard as described in Article 2 are areas designated as AH zones.

The following provisions apply:
(a) The specific standards for all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation has been provided shall be required as set forth in Article 4.
(b) Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
5. FLOODWAY. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article 2 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
(a) The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
(b) The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(c) If an encroachment is determined not to increase flood levels within the community as set forth in subparagraph (b) above, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 4.
(d) In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other sources as set forth in Article 4.
6. RECREATIONAL VEHICLES. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and numbered A, AE and AH Zones on the community’s FIRM either:
(a) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or
(b) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use12; or
12 A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

100 Title. These regulations shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision Regulations of the City of Park City, Kansas", and shall hereinafter be referred to as "these regulations."
101 Purpose. Responsible land subdivision is the initial step in the process of orderly community development. Once land has been divided into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is difficult and costly. These regulations are designed and intended to serve the following purposes:

B. To provide for (1) desirable lot layouts, (2) efficient and orderly location of streets and the extent and manner in which they shall be improved, and (3) storm water drainage;
C. To provide for adequate water supply, sewage disposal, various utility services and other improvements to protect public health, safety and general welfare;
D. To provide for and secure to the proper governmental agencies the actual construction of all such necessary on-site and off-site public improvements including the reservation or dedication of land for park and recreational purposes;
E. To provide protection from periodic flooding conditions;
F. To reserve or dedicate land for open space to preserve natural areas for watercourses, drainage ways, wetlands, woodland, rugged topography, wildlife habitat, and for water quality and quantity, and to protect land from soil erosion;
G. To avoid water and air pollution and the congestion of population and traffic;
H. To facilitate safety by adequate access for fire fighting equipment and police protection;
I. To coordinate the subdividing of land with applicable zoning regulations, various construction codes and other City regulations which also affect the development of the land;
1-2
J. To establish administrative procedures necessary to assure a fair and uniform basis for a working relationship with subdividers, utility providers and various governmental agencies, all of whom are contributing to the development of the community; and
K. To realize the goals, policies and planning proposals as contained in the adopted Comprehensive Development Plan.
102 Authority. These regulations are adopted under authority established by K.S.A., 12-741 et seq. as amended, 12-742, 12-749, 12-751 and 12-752, 12-760 and 12-761, 12-764, 12-766, 12-3009 through 12-3012, and 12-3301 and 12-3302.
103 Jurisdiction. These regulations shall apply to all subdivisions of land within the corporate limits of the City of Park City in Sedgwick County, Kansas as presently exists or are hereinafter established by annexation. All such land is included in the Planning Area for the Comprehensive Development Plan.
104 Applicability. The owner(s) of any land within the jurisdiction of these regulations desiring to vacate rights-of-way, easements, other public reservations or recorded plats or to:
A. Divide or further divide land into two or more lots or parcels; or
B. Otherwise alter the boundaries of lots or parcels of land; or
C. Establish land for use as streets, alleys or other property intended for public use or for the use of a purchaser or owner(s) of lots or parcels;
shall cause a plat to be made in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, unless exempted under Section 1-105.
105 Exemptions. Notwithstanding the requirements of Sections 1-103 and 104, these regulations shall not apply in the following instances or transactions:
A. Whenever any lot, parcel or tract of land located within the area governed by these regulations has been legally subdivided, resubdivided or replatted and recorded prior to the effective date of these regulations.
B. A transaction between owners of adjoining land which involves only a change in the boundary between the land owned by such persons and which does not create an additional lot or which does not result in the creation of a substandard lot by either owner according to any applicable zoning regulations.
1-3
C. A conveyance or dedication of land or interest therein for use as a street, highway, road or railroad right-of-way, a drainage easement or public utilities subject to local, state or federal regulation, where no new street or easement of access is created.
D. The layout of burial lots in cemeteries; however, the actual cemetery tract is not exempt.
E. Any lot split in industrially zoned areas divided in accordance with the provisions of Section 9-102 of these regulations.
F. Any transfer by operation of law.
Any request made in writing for a determination as to qualifications for being exempt from these regulations shall be answered by the Subdivision Administrator either in the affirmative or negative within 30 days of filing such a request containing all relevant information.

ARTICLE 4. PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY AND FINAL PLATS
100 Submittal of Sketch Plan. The subdivider may, if deemed desirable, submit a sketch plan in order to receive the pre-plat comments of the Subdivision Committee and/or the Planning Commission which may prove helpful in designing the preliminary plat. Ten copies of the sketch plan should be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator in a simple format sufficient to convey the location of proposed streets and utilities, the general layout of lots, and to note any particular design situations which could benefit from an early discussion of the problems. One copy of the sketch plan shall be returned to the subdivider with notations marked as to the comments resulting from such a review process. No fee shall be charged for the sketch plan review.
101 Filing of Preliminary Plat. An application shall be filed with the Subdivision Administrator at least 30 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission and such number of copies of the preliminary plat as may be determined necessary by the Administrator for proper review by affected and interested governmental and public and private organizations. Such plat shall not be accepted for filing until the fee as provided for in Section 3-109 has been paid by the subdivider to the Clerk. The preliminary plat shall contain the information as set out in Section 5-100 of these regulations.
102 Distribution and Review of Preliminary Plat. After the filing of the preliminary plat, the Subdivision Administrator shall distribute copies to affected and interested governmental and public and private organizations as appropriate. Organizations receiving copies shall have 15 days to review the preliminary plat and to make their comments and recommendations to the Planning Commission. A lack of response in 15 days shall, at the discretion of the Commission, signify approval, unless during this period a written request for an extension of one time only not to exceed 15 days is submitted to the Commission.
103 Action by the Planning Commission on Preliminary Plat. The Planning Commission shall review the preliminary plat and consider the comments and recommendations of the organizations to whom the preliminary plat had been submitted for review. If deemed desirable, the Commission may mail notices or copies of agendas to interested parties and conduct a public hearing for the purpose of receiving information supporting or opposing the preliminary plat.
A. The Planning Commission shall determine whether the preliminary plat generally meets the design standards and requirements of these regulations, the Comprehensive Plan, the applicable zoning regulations and other applicable provisions of the ordinances of the City.
B. If satisfied, the Planning Commission shall approve the preliminary plat with or without conditions by a majority vote of the members present and voting, and so notify the subdivider in writing.
C. If the Planning Commission determines that the preliminary plat does not satisfy the foregoing conditions, it may suggest modifications so as to satisfy such conditions and in such event:
1. The subdivider may amend the preliminary plat so as to incorporate such modifications and
4-2
resubmit the plat to the Commission, which shall then grant its approval if such amendments satisfactorily incorporate the suggested modifications; or
2. The subdivider may reject the suggested modifications or, within the time allowed for Commission action, may refrain from taking any action thereon. In either event, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been disapproved and the Commission shall thereupon furnish the subdivider with a written statement setting forth the reasons for disapproval of the preliminary plat.
D. If the Planning Commission determines that the preliminary plat does not satisfy the conditions of these regulations and that modifications would be too extensive or impractical, it shall disapprove the preliminary plat and immediately notify the subdivider in writing of its action, all within 60 days.
104 Failure of Planning Commission to Act on Preliminary Plat. If the Planning Commission fails to approve or disapprove a preliminary plat within 60 days after the date such plat is filed with the Subdivision Administrator or from the date the subdivider has filed the last item of required data, whichever date is later, then such preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been approved, unless the subdivider shall have consented in writing to extend or waive such time limitation.
105 Effect of Approval of Preliminary Plat.
A. Approval of the preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the subdivision by the Planning Commission, but shall signify in general the acceptability of the proposed subdivision.
B. Such approval shall be considered permission to submit the final plat accompanied by the information required by Section 5-101R.
C. Such approval shall be effective for no more than 12 months from the date approval was granted, unless, upon application from the subdivider, the Planning Commission grants an extension of time beyond such period. If a final plat for the entire subdivision or a unit thereof has not been filed with the Subdivision Administrator within such period, or any extensions granted thereto, the preliminary plat must be resubmitted to the Commission as if such plat had never been approved, except that no additional fee shall be charged for such resubmittal if there are no substantive changes from the previous preliminary plat approval.
106 Filing of Final Plat. An application for final plat approval, together with a sufficient number of copies as determined by the Subdivision Administrator for proper review, shall be filed with the Administrator at least 20 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Commission and within 12 months after the date that the preliminary plat has been approved. The Administrator shall transmit the final plat to the Commission and to other affected and interested governmental and public and private organizations as desirable for any further recommendations. The final plat shall contain the information as set out in Section 5-101 of these regulations. An application for a replat approval is processed in the same manner as a final plat. (See Section 2-102 for definition of a REPLAT under the heading of PLAT.)
4-3
107 Planning Commission Action on the Final Plat. The Planning Commission shall, within 60 days after the first meeting of the Commission following the date that the plat with all required data is filed with the Subdivision Administrator, review and approve the final plat by a majority vote of the members present and voting if:
A. It is substantially the same as the approved preliminary plat; or
B. There has been compliance with all conditions which may have been attached to the approval of the preliminary plat; and
C. It complies with all of the provisions contained in these regulations and of other applicable regulations or laws.
108 Failure of Planning Commission to Act on Final Plat. If the Planning Commission fails to approve or disapprove the final plat within the 60 days designated by state law for its consideration as stated in Section 4-107, it shall be deemed to have been approved and a certificate shall be issued by the Secretary upon demand, unless the subdivider shall have consented in writing to extend or waive such time limitation. (See K.S.A. 12-752(b).)
109 Submittal to Governing Body of Final Plat. Before a final plat is recorded, it shall be submitted to the Governing Body for its acceptance of dedications for street rights-of-way and other public ways, drainage and utility easements, and any land dedicated for public use and accompanied by guarantees for the installation of required improvements according to Section 7-103.
110 Governing Body Action on Final Plat. The Governing Body shall either accept or not accept the dedication of any land for public purposes by a majority vote within 30 days after the first meeting of the Governing Body following the date of the submission of the plat to the Clerk. The Governing Body may defer action for an additional 30 days for the purpose of allowing for modifications to comply with the requirements established by the Governing Body. If the Governing Body defers action on the plat or declines to accept the dedications thereto, it shall advise the Planning Commission and the subdivider in writing of the reasons therefor. Acceptance of the dedications on the plat shall be shown over the signature of the Mayor and attested to by the Clerk.
111 Recording of Final Plat. The final plat with all required signatures and in the exact form as accepted by the Governing Body shall be recorded by the subdivider with the County Register of Deeds. The subdivider shall pay the recording fee and any outstanding real estate taxes and special assessments. Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission and acceptance by the Governing Body shall be null and void if the plat is not acceptable for recording in the office of the Register of Deeds or is not recorded within 60 days after final approval by the Governing Body. The subdivider shall submit to the Subdivision Administrator such number of copies of the recorded plat as is necessary for record keeping purposes of the City and other affected governmental agencies. (See Section 5-101R1 for title report and 10-100C for Vacation of Unrecorded Plat.)

3. A copy, if any, of restrictive covenants applicable to the subdivision. As a service to the subdivider, such restrictions may be reviewed by the Planning Commission and other officials to determine if any potential conflicts exist with the City's laws.
ARTICLE 6. DESIGN STANDARDS
100 Scope. All subdivision of land subject to these regulations shall conform to the minimum design standards of this Article.
101 Comprehensive Development Plan. Subdivisions shall conform with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan.
102 Land for Public Facility Sites. Public agencies using the Comprehensive Plan as a guide may use the following procedure for acquiring sites for public facilities which does not preclude voluntary dedication and mutual negotiations for land or the use of the condemnation laws of the State: (See Section 2-102 for definition of RESERVE.)
A. The subdivider offers to sell to the appropriate public body, agency or authority, lands, sites and locations for parks, recreational areas, schools, fire stations or other public facilities. As soon as the preliminary plat has been received and reviewed, the Planning Commission shall give 45 days notice to the public body, agency or authority that it appears that lands should be considered for public acquisition. If within that 45 days the body receiving notice fails to act or submits a negative report on acquisition, then the subdivision and design thereof shall be treated as if no such request for land had been made.
B. If the organization receiving notice replies in writing that they desire to acquire land within the subdivision, they shall have an additional 45 days after making such reply to make arrangements for such land acquisition.
C. The time allocated for making the above determination may be extended with the mutual consent of the subdivider and the organization involved.
103 Land for Open Space. The following conditions may be required as part of the approval of any subdivision plat: (See Section 2-102 for definition of RESERVE and WETLAND.)
A. That the subdivider provide appropriate dedication of land or easements for the preservation of open space areas within a subdivision. Such open space may be needed to preserve areas containing natural watercourses, drainage ways, areas subject to periodic flooding, wetlands, substantial woodland, rugged topography and wildlife habitat; to maintain water quality and quantity; and to protect land from soil erosion. In general, such land is not normally considered as buildable land and should not be developed in order to maintain the quality of the environment.
6-1
104 Land Subject to Flooding.
A. Whenever a subdivision of land including platting for manufactured home parks and other developments on one-lot plats is located on flood prone land identified on a Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) (F.I.R.M.) prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the following requirements shall apply: (See City Zoning Regulations for floodway and floodway fringe districts.) (See Section 5-101 O for minimum pad elevations.)
1. Show on the preliminary and final plats the boundary lines and elevations for both floodway, if any, and base flood elevation; and
2. Assure that (a) all such subdivisions are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, (b) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, water, gas and electrical systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (c) adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
105 Land Subject to Excessive Erosion by Wind or Water. On land subject to excessive soil movement by the forces of wind and/or water and that may cause environmental health hazards, necessary preventive measures shall be a part of the subdivision plat. Conservation standards applicable to subdivisions shall be adhered to which are used by the Sedgwick County Conservation District.
106 Access. All lots located in any subdivision must contain at least 40 feet of frontage for driveways directly connected to an opened public street and not across the land of others. Flag lots are not permitted, unless warranted by an unusual shape of the land or the ownership of property. (See Section 2-102 for definition of FLAG LOT.)
107 Streets-Layout and Design.
A. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the intent of the Comprehensive Plan, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjoining lands; to topographical conditions; to the run-off of storm water; to public convenience and safety; and in their appropriate relations to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
B. Where such is not shown on a Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
1. Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in surrounding areas; or
6-2
2. Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the Planning Commission to meet a particular situation where topographic or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
C. Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
D. If a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed limited access highway, arterial street or railroad right-of-way, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots with access control provisions along the rear property line and screening, deep lots with rear service alleys or such other design as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
E. Reserve strips controlling access of streets shall be prohibited except where their control is placed with the Governing Body under acceptable conditions.
F. Street right-of-way requirements for other than arterials shall be determined by the total aggregate needs for the functional components for the particular system being considered. The total aggregates shall be in increments of even feet, even numbers only. The components involved shall be as follows depending upon the type of characteristics of the street needed based on land use, traffic and density:
1. Moving or traffic lanes may be variable from nine to 12 feet depending on function, e.g., low density residential, cul-de-sac residential, collector, industrial, etc., and on design speed of the roadway. A moving lane may utilize a portion of the surface of certain types of curb construction.
2. Parking lanes for on-street storage of vehicles shall be at least eight feet in width. For computation purposes, up to two feet for curb or shoulder may be included as part of the parking lane.
3. A curb and gutter shall be considered to require two feet irrespective of construction type.
4. Shoulders for streets without curbs shall be not less than three feet in width.
5. Parking strips for streets shall be at least 14 1/2 feet in width from the back of curb to the right-of-way line. This area shall be used for the installation of utilities, street signs, street lights, traffic control devices, fire hydrants, sidewalks, driveways, street furniture, street trees from an approved City list and to provide a transition area in grades, if necessary, between the roadway and the property adjacent to the right-of-way.
6-3
6. Based on the above general criteria, street rights-of-way and roadways shall be calculated from the following guidelines:
R-O-W for Street In feet*
Roadway Width
In feet
a. Collector including Commercial, Industrial or Multiple-Family Areas.
70-80
36-40**
b. Local Residential including Cul-de-sacs and Single and Two-Family Areas.
60
30-34**
c. Local Marginal Access Street (two moving lanes with no parking on one side plus a parking strip between curb and the main road right-of-way).
50
28 **
d. Alleys for Residential, if necessary, and Commercial Areas.
20
20
-----------------
* For arterial standards, see Sections 6-107G and H.
** Face of curb to face of curb.
These widths may be modified by the Planning Commission on a showing that special conditions exist such as drainage and utility requirements, safe and efficient traffic and pedestrian movement, intersection design, etc. In applying these standards, workable street systems must be established. When a pattern of widths based on function for a given area has been established, the pattern shall be followed until another system can be established or ties into a collector or arterial system. Access control and acceleration and deceleration lanes may be required to properly handle traffic flow and to protect the carrying capacity of the street.
G. Arterial right-of-way widths shall be as shown in the Comprehensive Plan and where not shown thereon shall be between 80-100 feet.
H. For streets and roadways on the Functional Classification System of the City, prevailing design standards shall apply.
I. Wherever possible, there shall be an inside tangent at least 100 feet in length introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
J. Streets shall be laid out so as to provide for horizontal sight distances on all curves depending upon design speed. These distances shall be:
Arterial Streets: 500 feet
Collector Streets: 300 feet
Local Streets: 200 feet
6-4
The sight distance shall be measured within street rights-of-way from a height of four and one-half feet above the proposed pavement surface in the right-hand lane of the roadway.
K. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 80 degrees.
L. Street jogs are to be avoided on arterial and collector streets. On local streets, center line offsets of less than 150 feet should be avoided.
M. Roadway grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves: Roadway Type Percent Grade
Arterial 3%
Collector 4%
Local 5%
Marginal Access 5%
N. No roadway grade shall be less than 0.30 of one percent, unless approved by the applicable engineer. Greater percentages of grade may be required where necessary to provide adequate drainage.
O. Roadway pavement at intersections shall be rounded by the following minimum radii:
Minimum Type of Roadway Intersection Width Curb Radii
Local Residential Local Residential 20 feet
Local Residential Collector 30 feet
Local Residential Arterial 30 feet
Commercial/Industrial Commercial/Industrial
Collector or Arterial Collector or Arterial 50 feet
P. Half-streets shall be avoided, except for arterial streets and collector streets where applicable, or where they are essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations; or, when the Planning Commission finds that it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half-street, or portion thereof, exists and is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. No construction of the roadway shall occur until the full right-of-way is provided.
Q. The length of cul-de-sacs and the dimensions of the turnaround shall be determined as follows:
1. Cul-de-sacs in single-family areas should not generally be longer than seven times the average lot width or 600 feet, whichever is less. In multiple-family residential areas, such streets shall not exceed 300 feet.
6-5
2. Turnarounds shall have a turn diameter of at least 70 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet, or shall have an alternate turnaround area such as hammerheads, etc., as providing service equal to the foregoing requirement.
R. Subdividers are encouraged to consider projects designed to maximize solar access when not in conflict with existing contours or drainage. When the long axis of individual structures is parallel to the street, streets should be oriented as nearly as possible in an east/west direction. If the long axis of structures is perpendicular to the street, north/south street orientation is preferable for solar access purposes.
108 Alleys.
A. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas, except that the Planning Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking spaces consistent and adequate for the uses proposed. Alleys in residential districts are to be discouraged.
B. When provided, the minimum right-of-way of an alley shall be 20 feet.
C. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, a turning radius shall be provided to permit safe vehicular movement.
D. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, such alleys shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end.
109 Blocks and Pedestrian Ways.
A. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
1. Provision of adequate building sites suitable for the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
2. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions, off-street parking and loading, etc.
3. Need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.
4. Limitations and opportunities of topography.
B. A block should not exceed 1,340 feet in length, unless the previous layout or topographic conditions justify a modification. In general, blocks shall not be less than 400 feet unless necessary because of existing street patterns.
C. All blocks shall be so designed so as to provide two tiers of lots, unless a different arrangement is required in order to comply with or be permitted by other sections of these regulations.
D. Blocks may be irregular in shape, provided they are harmonious with the overall pattern of blocks in the proposed subdivision.
6-6

ARTICLE 7. INSTALLATION OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
100 Engineering Responsibility. In setting certain standards and specifications, approving engineering drawings, inspecting improvements, recommending acceptance of improvements, preparing petition forms and establishing the amount of surety for guaranteeing the installation of such improvements; the engineer designated by the City or utility provider representative shall be designated as responsible for the improvements within their respective jurisdictions. Coordination to achieve cooperation among the responsible parties is the responsibility of the City and, in particular, the Subdivision Administrator.
101 Required Improvements. As a condition to final plat approval, the subdivider of a proposed subdivision shall be responsible to install or, in cooperation with the Governing Body and utility companies, cause to be installed the following necessary facilities and improvements as listed below. The design and installation of such facilities and improvements shall include such sizing of pipes and extensions of streets as may be deemed desirable within the subdivision to facilitate development of adjacent land.
A. All streets, alleys, curbs, gutters and street drainage facilities shall be constructed in accordance with established City standards. Streets shall be constructed of concrete, asphalt or asphaltic concrete and no gravel or sanded roadways shall be constructed. To accommodate any future improvements, the entire right-of-way of collector and local streets shall be graded to match the level of the road surface. All stumps, trees that cannot be saved, boulders and similar items shall be removed from such right-of-way. **
B. A storm drainage system shall be provided, separate and independent of the sanitary sewer system, meeting all of the specifications and requirements of the City. Such storm drainage system shall be connected to any existing storm sewer system, where available, or if such connection is not available, other adequate means for the discharge of such storm water including the use of detention ponds shall be provided by the subdivider into the nearest major water channel. If it is determined that adequate drainage can be accomplished by a natural drainage way across private property, a drainage easement may be required; however, any initial channelization is the responsibility of the subdivider and continued maintenance the responsibility of the adjacent property owner(s). ****
C. Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with standards set by the City under the following conditions: (Also, see Section 6-109E for pedestrian ways.)
1. Sidewalks may be required on one or both sides of the street when needed to service pedestrian traffic flow leading to schools, parks, shopping areas or places of public assembly and where heavy traffic would warrant sidewalks for safety purposes. Sidewalks shall be required to extend or complete connecting links in the sidewalk system.
2. In general, sidewalks shall be constructed nearer to property lines rather than curb lines.
* Note: City street standards are based on the current edition of the following publication: A Policy on Geometric Design of Highway and Streets as adopted by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
** Note: When required by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, non-point source storm water permit applications must be filed before construction begins under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (N.P.D.E.S.).
7-1
3. All sidewalks shall provide handicap access in conformity with K.S.A. 58-1301 et seq. and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 USCA 12101, as may be amended.
D. Street signs shall be installed in accordance with specifications set by the City subject to the standards of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices as adopted by the Secretary of the Kansas Department of Transportation and endorsed by the Federal Highway Administrator. (See K.S.A. 8-2003 for sign manual.)
E. A municipal type water supply system shall be installed in accordance with the standards and requirements set by the applicable agency supplying the water.
F. Fire hydrants of the type and quality specified by City standards, but not less than the minimum standards of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), shall be provided and connected to municipal type water supply system. Such hydrants shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the applicable Fire Chief.
G. A sanitary sewer system shall be installed in accordance with standards set by the City subject to the regulations of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
H. Underground wiring in residential subdivisions, unless found to be unfeasible, is required for electric power, street lights and telephone service, except:
1. For lines rated over 12,000 volts;
2. Appurtenance serving such lines which may be mounted on the ground, such as transformers, transformer pads, telephone service pedestals and street light poles; or
3. For those proposed subdivisions or replats of existing subdivisions located in areas which presently have an overhead type utility distribution system.
All such installation shall be under contract with the applicable utility provider. Cable television, if installed, shall be placed underground in accordance with the above requirements. Where telephone, electric, street lights and gas lines are placed underground entirely throughout a subdivision, conduits or cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner which will not conflict with other underground services. Further, all transformer boxes shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to the public.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring underground installation of lines beyond the boundaries of the area contained in the preliminary plat.
All utility lines for telephone and electric service, when carried on overhead poles, shall be placed in rear lot line easements or designated side lot line easements.
I. If screening of public or private areas is to be required, a screening plan of landscaping and/or fencing shall be prepared and approved by the Planning Commission and such screening installed. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SCREENING.)
7-2
J. Monuments as shown on the final plat shall be placed at all central points such as block corners, angle points, points of curves in streets and as may be required by the engineer. Monuments shall be made of iron pipes or solid steel rods, e.g., rebars which are not less than one-half inch in outside diameter and not less than 24 inches in length and affixed with a plastic or metal cap which identifies the registration number of the surveyor in responsible charge. All monuments shall be securely placed and set in such a manner that the top of the monument shall be at grade ground level. If cultivation of the land for farming purposes is anticipated, monuments may be lowered nine inches below grade ground level. Bench marks may also be required of such material, size and length as may be approved by the engineer. (See Section 2-102 for definitions of BENCH MARK and MONUMENT and Sections 5-101 D and E for monuments and bench mark(s) to be shown on the final plat.)
K. Whenever existing sanitary or storm water sewers, water lines, drainage channels, culverts, underground or overhead electric and communication lines, gas lines, pipe lines, transmission lines are required to be relocated due to the subdivision or construction of improvements required as a condition of approval of the subdivision and in the event such was not known at the time of subdivision approval for any reason, the costs of such relocation shall be the sole responsibility of the subdivider.
L. Where required, applicable measures will be taken during construction to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation by wind or water. Conservation standards shall be adhered to which have been adopted by the County Conservation District.
102 Exceptions for Existing Improvements.
A. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently having any or all required improvements as set out in Section 7-101 and where such improvements meet the requirements of said section and are in good condition as determined by the Governing Body, no further provision need be made by the subdivider to duplicate such improvements. Where such existing improvements do not meet the requirements; however, the subdivider shall provide for the repair, correction or replacement of such improvements so that all improvements will then meet the aforesaid requirements.
B. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently abutting or containing any existing public street of less than the minimum required right-of-way width or roadway width, land shall be dedicated in so far as is possible so as to provide for a minimum street right-of-way width and an additional roadway pavement meeting the minimum standards as set by these regulations. The Governing Body shall determine what adjustment to make where the aforesaid widenings merge with existing streets which are of smaller width at the boundary of such proposed subdivision. The minimum right-of-way and roadway width required by these regulations may be reduced to match an existing roadway system if the extension of such roadway is already improved at each end of the roadway in the subdivision.
103 Agreement and Guarantees for Installation of Required Improvements. Except for monuments, one
7-3
of the following methods shall be used by the subdivider to guarantee that improvements required by these regulations can or will be installed in accordance with approved plans and specifications. This does not preclude the possibility that the Governing Body may, at its discretion and in recognition of its financial position, share in the cost of all improvements, especially oversized improvements which may benefit other related areas or the municipality-at-large:
A. Fiscal sureties may be offered and the following shall apply: (See Section 2-102 for definition of Subdivider's Agreement.)
1. The subdivider shall enter into a "Subdivider's Agreement" with the Governing Body under which the subdivider agrees to install such required improvements. Such agreement shall be conditioned upon the acceptances of the final plat by the Governing Body and filed with the Clerk.
2. Simultaneously with the execution of the Subdivider's Agreement provided for in Section 7-103A1, the subdivider shall furnish a corporate completion bond by a firm authorized to do business in Kansas with good and sufficient sureties thereon or a cashier's check, escrow account or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the Governing Body, in the amount of the estimated cost as approved by the official responsible for setting and enforcing the applicable design and construction standards of the installation of the required improvements. Such financial guarantee shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the final plat and further conditioned upon the actual completion and satisfactory installation of such required improvements within two years from the date that the final plat is accepted by the Governing Body.
3. Simultaneously with the execution of the Subdivider's Agreement provided for in Section 7-103A1, if the subdivider furnishes a corporate completion bond, he or she shall also deposit in escrow with the Governing Body cash in the amount of 15% of the cost of all improvements to be made in accordance with the plans and specifications for required improvements or an equivalent amount in the form of a maintenance bond or other securities that may be deemed sufficient by the Governing Body. If a subdivider furnishes a cashier's check, escrow account or irrevocable letter of credit, 15% of the amount of such guarantees shall be returned by, or held as a deposit in escrow after, the final completion of such improvements. The subdivider shall agree that such deposit in escrow may be held by the Governing Body for a period of 18 months after such improvements are completed for the purpose of:
a. Guaranteeing and securing the correction of any defect in material or workmanship furnished for such improvements, latent in character, and not discernible at the time of final inspection or acceptance by the Governing Body; and
b. Guarantee against any damage to such improvements by reason of the settling of the ground, base or foundation thereof.
Such escrow agreement shall provide that, as such defects have so developed, that the deposit may be applied by the Governing Body for any amounts incurred correcting such defects; and that the balance of such deposit, if any, held at the end of such 18-month period
7-4
shall be returned by the Governing Body to the depositor, or paid to the order of the depositor without payment of interest.
B. Petitions to the Governing Body may be submitted as a means of guaranteeing the authority to install improvements at such time as they deem appropriate. Petitions may be submitted only when the following conditions exist:
1. The petitions must be valid as may be provided for under Kansas law.
2. The petitions must be approved by the Governing Body concurrently with the acceptance of the final plat.
3. The initiating resolution for such improvement must be adopted by the Governing Body concurrently with the petition approval or as soon thereafter as may be provided by law. The cost of the publication of said resolution shall be born by the subdivider.
4. A certificate signed by the petitioner must be recorded with the County Register of Deeds stating that such petitions have been filed and approved by the Governing Body and that certain land within the plat as described will be liable in the future for special assessment for the required improvements authorized.
C. The subdivider shall, prior to the acceptance of the final plat, submit a letter from the utility provider(s) involved stating that satisfactory arrangements have been made by the subdivider guaranteeing the installation of their respective services.
D. Monuments and bench marks shall be installed and their installation certified by a licensed land surveyor on the final plat before such plat is recorded with the County Register of Deeds. (See Section 5-101 Q 1 for surveyor's certification.)
104 Off-site Improvements. The Governing Body may, upon making a finding of necessity, require the subdivider to install or upgrade off-site improvements located outside the perimeter of a subdivision if such need is substantially created by a proposed subdivision. Such off-site improvements should be within dedicated rights-of-way or easements and serve a public purpose. The financing and guaranteeing of such improvements shall be administered as if they were the same as on-site improvements under Section 7-103. The Governing Body may require such subdivision to participate in the following facilities and improvements, or any other off-site improvements as recommended by the Planning Commission, if the need is created by a proposed subdivision:
A. Drainage improvements;
B. Pedestrian ways and sidewalks;
C. Screening;
D. Special grading requirements;
7-5

ARTICLE 8. IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURES
100 Submittal of Petitions. If petitions are proposed to meet the requirements of Article 7, the subdivider shall so indicate at the time of submittal of the preliminary plat. If the petition method is authorized by the Governing Body, petitions shall accompany the final plat for approval by the Governing Body.
101 Final Improvement Plans. When the use of petitions has not been requested by the subdivider or authorized by the Governing Body and a letter(s) of satisfactory arrangements from a utility provider(s) are not being utilized to guarantee improvements (See Section 7-103C for letter from utility), the subdivider shall have prepared by an engineer (which may be contracted for privately or with any governmental agency or utility), engineering drawings for proposed required improvements containing the data and information specified in Section 8-101A. Such drawings shall be certified by a licensed engineer and shall be submitted to the applicable reviewing official in duplicate at least 20 days prior to the date that approval is requested.
A. Content. The engineering drawings shall contain the following data plus additional information deemed necessary by the applicable engineer:
1. Plans, details, specifications and cost estimates for roadway, alley and sidewalk construction; including plans, profile indicating existing topography and elevation including curb and sidewalk elevation when required, intersection control elevation and paving geometrics for each street with a typical cross section of the roadway. The profiles of grade lines shall be shown to a scale of one inch equals 100 feet horizontal, and one inch equals 10 feet vertical; or to a scale approved by the applicable engineer. This information shall be shown on standard plan and profile sheets unless otherwise required by the engineer and use topographic information cited in Section 5-100B3.
2. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed storm drainage improvements.
3. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed water distribution system, water supply facilities and fire hydrants.
4. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed sanitary sewage system.
5. All plans for other utilities such as for electric, gas and telephone shall be prepared by or at the direction of the utility providing the service.
B. Review. The applicable engineer, official or agency responsible for determining specifications and standards shall review all engineering drawings in order to determine whether such drawings are consistent with the approved final plat and comply with the design standards. If such drawings are consistent and so comply, the reviewing official shall forward to the Governing Body a notice to that effect. In the event that the drawings do not so comply, the reviewing official shall notify the subdivider of the specific manner in which such drawings do not comply, and he or she may then
8-1
correct such drawings. If such drawings are not corrected, the reviewing official shall forward to the Governing Body a notice as to the items of nonconformity or noncompliance.
102 Construction of Improvements. No improvements shall be constructed nor shall any work preliminary thereto be done until such time as the engineering construction drawings shall have been approved and there shall have been compliance with all of the requirements relating to the Subdivider's Agreement and such guarantees as are specified in Section 7-103 of these regulations.
A. Inspection. All improvements constructed or erected shall be subject to inspection by the applicable engineer or official responsible for setting and enforcing the applicable design and construction standards of the required improvements. The cost attributable to all inspections required by these regulations shall be charged to and paid by the subdivider. In so far as is possible, the subdivider shall give at least 48 hours notification to such official prior to the performance of any inspection work.
B. Inspection Procedures. After notice is received as specified in Section 8-102A above, the applicable engineer or official designated may conduct an on-site inspection to determine that the work complies with the approved engineering plans and specifications. If in the opinion of such engineer or official, the work does not comply with such final drawings, he or she shall have authority to order that all such work shall be terminated until such time as necessary steps are taken to correct any defects or deficiencies. Upon the correction of such defects or deficiencies, the subdivider shall again notify the applicable engineer or official as provided in Section 8-102A that the work is again ready for inspection.
C. Final Inspection. Upon completion of all improvements within the area covered by the final plat, the subdivider shall notify the applicable engineer or official designated in Section 8-102A above, who shall thereupon conduct a final inspection of all improvements installed. If such final inspection indicates that there are any defects or deficiencies in such improvements as installed, or if there are any deviations in such improvements as installed from the final engineering plans and specifications, he or she shall notify the subdivider in writing and the subdivider shall, at their sole cost and expense, correct such defects or deviations within six months of the date of notification.
When such defects, deficiencies or deviations have been corrected, the subdivider shall notify the official that the improvements are again ready for final inspection. After the final inspection is made and before acceptance of the improvement by the Governing Body, the subdivider shall file a statement with the engineer or official which is executed by the subdivider, certifying that all obligations incurred in the construction of the improvement involved have been properly paid and settled.
103 Acceptance of Improvements. If a final inspection indicates that all improvements as installed contain no unacceptable defects, deficiencies or deviations, within 15 days from the submission of the subdivider's statement of obligation paid, the applicable engineer or official designated shall certify to the Governing Body and utility provider(s) that all improvements have been installed in conformity with the engineering plans and specifications accompanying the final plat. Upon the receipt by the Governing Body of such notification and in conformity with the requirements of these regulations and all other
8-2
applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations, the Governing Body shall thereupon by resolution or utility by letter formally accept such improvements. The improvements shall become the property of the Governing Body or utility provider(s) involved. Prior to this final action, however, neither the acceptance of the final plat, any subsequent annexation to the City or irrespective of any act(s) of employees, such actions shall not constitute their formal acceptance of improvements.
8-3
ARTICLE 9. PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF LOT SPLITS
100 Application Procedure. The Planning Commission is hereby authorized to approve or disapprove lot splits. An application with the required fee for a lot split approval shall be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator by the owner of the land at least 15 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission. (See Section 3-109 for Fees.) Four copies of a drawing to scale of the lots involved if there are no structures on the lot shall accompany the application or four copies of a survey if there are structures on the lot showing the precise location of structures thereon. Each drawing or survey shall show the location, dimensions and legal description of the proposed split; the square footage contained in each portion of the original lot; all existing easements including public reservations such as building setback lines or access control and a certificate of approval as worded in Section 9-101C.
Written notices shall be distributed by the Administrator to all owners of land adjacent to the property proposed to be split including such owners across the street or other public way. The application for a lot split must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of all persons to receive notices. Such owners shall have 10 days from the date of mailing the notification to inform the Administrator of any protest or concerns they may have on the lot split. The 10 day waiting period may be waived upon presentation of a written statement of no objection from those to be notified.
101 Approval Guidelines. Approval or disapproval of lot splits shall be made based on the following guidelines:
A. No lot split shall be approved if:
1. A new street or alley is needed or proposed.
2. A vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is required and has not been satisfied.
3. Such action will result in significant increases in service requirements, e.g., utilities, drainage, traffic control, streets, sidewalks, etc. or will interfere with maintaining existing service levels, e.g., additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.
4. There is less street right-of-way than required by these regulations or the Comprehensive Plan unless such dedication can be made by separate instrument.
5. All easement requirements have not been satisfied.
6. Such split will result in a lot without direct access from its frontage to an opened public street. (See Section 6-106 for Access.)
7. A substandard sized lot will be created or an existing structure will not be able to meet all yard requirements according to applicable zoning regulations.
9-1
8. The lot is subject to periodic flooding which cannot be feasibly corrected by fill.
9. The lot has been previously split without replatting.
B. The Planning Commission may make such additional requirements as deemed necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of existing land development regulations and Governing Body policy. Requirements may include, but not be limited to, the installation of public facilities, water supply and sewage disposal and/or the dedication of right-of-way and easements.
C. The Planning Commission shall, in writing, either approve with or without conditions or disapprove the lot split within 45 days of application. If approved, and after all conditions have been met, the Chairperson of the Planning Commission shall sign the following certificate of approval as required on the lot split drawing or survey. Acknowledgement of the certificate may be made by a notary public or by the County Clerk, Register of Deeds, Mayor or Clerk. (See K.S.A. 58-2211, as amended.)

ARTICLE 10. VACATIONS AND CORRECTIONS
100 Vacation of Unrecorded Plat.
A. Upon written request of the subdivider to the Planning Commission, a preliminary or final plat may be withdrawn from consideration either before or after approval by the Commission. Upon approval of the request by a motion of the Commission, the Subdivision Administrator is automatically directed to remove the case file from the City records.
B. Upon written request of the subdivider to the Clerk, a final plat for which dedications, if any, have been accepted by the Governing Body may be vacated by motion of the Governing Body; provided, that (1) the plat has not been recorded; (2) no lots have been sold or transferred; and (3) no improvements have been installed. After the plat is vacated, the Administrator shall see that all fiscal sureties are returned to the subdivider except for those expenditures which have been incurred by the City in administrative, legal or engineering costs prior to the date of the request for vacation. Upon the return of such sureties, the Administrator is automatically directed to remove the case file including any petitions from the City records.
C. Upon determining from the County Register of Deeds that a final plat has not been recorded within 60 days from its final acceptance by the Governing Body, the Administrator shall notify the subdivider that the plat is null and void and that the case file will be removed from the City records within 30 days unless a reapplication for platting is received during that time. (See Section 4-112 for Recording of Final Plat.)
101 Vacation of Recorded Plat.
A. Recorded plats may be vacated by either replatting according to Section 10-101A1 below or directly vacated according to Section 10-101A2:
1. According to K.S.A. 12-512b, any recorded plat or part thereof or street, alley or other public reservation, including, without limitation, easements, dedicated building setback lines and access control, whether established by instrument, condemnation or earlier plats, shall be vacated both as to use and as to title without any further proceedings upon the filing and recording with the County Register of Deeds in accordance with K.S.A. 12-403, any plat or replat duly executed in accordance with these regulations which embraces the same lands as those heretofore embraced by the earlier plat or part thereof or street, alley or other public reservation. Streets, alleys or other public reservations which may be vacated shall revert, as provided for in K.S.A. 12-506, to abutting property owners according to their frontage thereon; provided, that such land to be reverted was derived directly or indirectly from the owner of the land from which such street, alley or public reservation was originally platted. The proper completion of the Owner's Certificate and Dedication as required by Section 5-101 Q 2 shall constitute appropriate notice to all persons having property rights or interests affected by the above platting or replatting.
2. Recorded plats may also be vacated without replatting. The procedure is the same as
10-1
provided for in Section 10-103.
102 Correction of Platting Errors.
A. According to K.S.A. 12-420, procedures are provided to correct certain platting errors. If, after recording a final plat, an error is found in distances, angles, bearings, subdivision or street names, block or lot numbers, the computation of dimension or elevation or other details of the plat, except in connection with the outer boundaries of the plat, and if the property described in that part of the plat containing the error is under the ownership of the person who caused the plat to be prepared, the City Engineer, after substantiation of the existence of the error, may file an affidavit with the County Register of Deeds that the error was made. The affidavit shall describe the nature and extent of the error and the appropriate correction. The Register of Deeds shall record the affidavit and shall place in the margin of the recorded plat a notation that the affidavit has been filed, the date of filing and the book and page where it is recorded. The filing of the affidavit shall correct any such errors, but shall have no effect on the validity of the plat or any property interest recorded by reference thereto. A copy of the recorded affidavit shall be filed with the Subdivision Administrator. The City will bill the person requesting the correction for engineering costs and recording fees.
103 Vacation of Streets, Alleys, Easements and Plats.
A. According to K.S.A. 12-504 and 505, the following procedures are provided to vacate streets, alleys or other public reservations such as, but not limited to public easements, dedicated building setback lines, access control, or a part thereof, and including all or parts of recorded plats: *
1. Petitions for vacations received from the Governing Body, the owner of platted land or the owner of land adjoining on both sides of any street, alley, easement or other public reservation may be filed with the Clerk and transmitted to the Subdivision Administrator for processing. All nongovernmental petitioners will be billed a processing fee. (See Section 3-109 for Fees.) The Planning Commission shall give public notice of a hearing on a proposed vacation by publication once in the official city newspaper by the Subdivision Administrator. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date set for such hearing. Such notice shall state (1) the nature of the vacation petition, (2) the legal description of the property and (3) the date, time and place for the hearing before the Planning Commission. The notice may contain the information that the hearing may be adjourned from time to time upon a motion to continue in the future at some stated date, time and place. Furthermore, the Commission by rule shall mail a notice at least 20 days before the hearing to all affected utility providers; all owners of land proposed for vacation; all landowners abutting a street, alley or easement including any segment remaining open; and owners on the opposite side of the street from vacations of setbacks and access control. The petitioner(s) shall provide a list of such landowners as required by the Subdivision Administrator, including names, addresses and zip codes. Such notice to providers and landowners shall be mailed so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the mailing date and the hearing date.
* Note: The same statutory procedure may be used to exclude a portion of land from the boundaries of the City, i.e., the land could also be "deannexed".
10-2
2. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider a recommendation to the Governing Body as to whether the vacation should be approved or disapproved and with or without conditions attached. At the hearing, the Planning Commission shall hear such testimony as may be presented or as may be required in order to fully understand the true nature of the petition and the propriety of recommending the same. If the Planning Commission determines from the testimony presented that:
a. due and legal notice has been given;
b. no private rights will be injured or endangered;
c. the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience; and
d. in justice to the petitioner(s) the vacation should be granted;
then the Planning Commission shall recommend that such vacation be approved and entered at length in the minutes. Such recommendation may provide for the reservation to the City and/or the owners of any lesser property rights for public utilities, rights-of-way and easements for public service facilities originally located in such vacated land or planned for the future. The recommendation may be conditioned upon the petitioner's responsibility to remove or relocate all underground or surface utilities or paving in or on the vacated land. The petition shall not be recommended by the Planning Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a written objection is filed with the Clerk, at or before the hearing, by any owner who would be a proper party to the petition, but has not joined therein. Furthermore, when only a portion of a street, alley or public reservation is proposed to be vacated, the petition shall not be recommended by the Planning Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a written objection is filed with the Clerk by any owner of lands which adjoin the portion to be vacated. The recommendation of the Planning Commission to the Governing Body shall be made in the same manner as provided by K.S.A. 12-752 for the submission and approval of a final plat. (See Sections 4-107 and 108 for the 60-day time period for consideration of a plat and Section 4-110 for Governing Body approval procedure.) The Planning Commission shall announce at their hearing when the Governing Body will consider the recommendation on the vacation.
Following the approval of the vacation by the Governing Body in the form of an order, the Clerk shall certify a copy of the order to the County Register of Deeds; however, such certification shall be withheld until such time as any conditions attached to the order have been satisfied. The Register of Deeds shall note on the recorded plat of the "townsite," i.e., the City, or the applicable platted addition, the words, "canceled by order" or "canceled in part by order" and give the book and page where recorded.
B. According to K.S.A. 14-423 and 423a, the following procedures are provided to vacate streets, avenues, alleys or lanes, and including all or part of recorded plats, but not to include public easements, dedicated building setback lines or access control:
1. Petitions for vacations may be accepted by the Subdivision Administrator from any person or
10-3
governmental agency. All nongovernmental petitions will be billed a processing fee. (See Section 3-109 for Fees.) The Governing Body shall consider such vacation on its agenda and may make inquiry to any person, staff, utility provider or governmental agency including the Planning Commission in order to determine the desirability of the vacation. No public hearing is required. If approved, the City Clerk shall publish the effectuating ordinance. Immediately upon publication, the City Clerk shall file a certified copy with the County Clerk to enter on the transfer records and then record the ordinance with the County Register of Deeds. No fee shall be charged by either office. The ordinance shall provide that the vacation shall become effective 30 days after publication unless one or more interested parties file a written protest with the City Clerk before the expiration time. If such a protest is made, the Governing Body shall set a hearing date 10 days after the end of the 30-day waiting period and the protester(s) notified. The hearing may be continued from time to time and at the conclusion the Governing Body shall adopt a resolution confirming the vacation ordinance and filing the same with the County Clerk and Register of Deeds as before. If the resolution is not adopted, the vacation ordinance shall become null and void and the County Clerk and Register of Deeds so notified. Whenever a street, avenue, alley or lane is vacated whether in a plat or not, the same shall revert to the adjacent owners in proportion to their frontage or proportion as to how it was acquired.
10-4
ARTICLE 11. APPEALS, WAIVERS AND MODIFICATIONS
100 Appeals General. The subdivider of a proposed subdivision may appeal decisions made in the enforcement of these regulations by the Subdivision Administrator to the Planning Commission and by the Planning Commission to the Governing Body. In the event the Governing Body sustains the Planning Commission, the action of the Planning Commission shall be final except as otherwise provided by law. If the Governing Body overrules the Planning Commission, the Governing Body shall make its decision, in writing or in the minutes of the meeting, stating the reason therefore and return such decision and plat to the Planning Commission for consideration of reapproval.
101 Appeals on Improvement Standards. Any appeal as to approval of standards or plans and engineering drawings in connection with required improvements shall be directed to the Governing Body and that action shall be final.
102 Waiver of Required Improvements or Guarantees for Installation of Same. Any waiver of the required improvements or guarantees for their installation may be made only by the Governing Body on a showing that such improvements are not technically feasible or necessary.
103 Modifications. In cases in which there is unwarranted hardship in carrying out the literal provisions of these regulations as to design standards, the Planning Commission may grant a modification from such provision according to the following guidelines: (See Article 6, Design Standards.)
A. A request for a modification shall be made to the Subdivision Administrator who shall transmit it to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall give the subdivider and any other interested person an opportunity to be heard with respect to the requested modification.
B. The Planning Commission shall not grant a modification unless it shall find that (1) the strict application of these regulations will create an unwarranted hardship; (2) modification is in harmony with the general spirit and intended purpose of these regulations; (3) the rights of adjacent property owners will not adversely be affected; and (4) the public safety, health and general welfare will be protected.
C. When used in this Section, the term "unwarranted hardship" shall mean the effective deprivation of use as distinguished from a mere inconvenience.
D. Modifications permitted under the provisions of this Article shall not include modifications from the requirements of improvement standards, required improvements or guaranteeing their installation unless approved by the Governing Body as provided for in Sections 11-101 and 102. Furthermore, variances may not be granted from the provisions of City Zoning Regulations by these modification procedures.
11-1
ARTICLE 12. AMENDMENTS AND REVIEW
100 Amendment Procedure. These regulations may be amended at any time after the Planning Commission shall have held a public hearing on the proposed amendment. A notice of such public hearing shall be published once in the official city newspaper so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the publication date and the date of such hearing. Such notice shall fix the time and place for the hearing and shall describe such proposed amendment(s) in general terms. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time. At its conclusion, the Planning Commission shall prepare its recommendations and by an affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission adopt the proposed amendments to these regulations and submit them, together with the written summary of the hearing thereon, to the Governing Body. The Governing Body either may: (1) Approve such recommendations by ordinance; (2) override the Planning Commission recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the City Council; or (3) return the same to the Commission for further consideration, together with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to approve or disapprove. If the Governing Body returns the Commission's recommendations, the Commission after considering the same, may resubmit their original recommendations giving the reasons therefore or submit new and amended recommendations. Upon the receipt of such recommendations, the Governing Body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendations by an ordinance, or it need take no further action thereon. If the Commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the Governing Body following the Commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the Governing Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendations and proceed accordingly. The amended regulations shall become effective upon publication of the respective adopting ordinance. A copy of such legal publication shall be added to the Appendix of these regulations.
101 Annual Review. In order to maintain these regulations, the Planning Commission shall annually hold a public review at its regular meeting in November to consider amendments, if any, to these regulations. Notification of such a public review may be distributed to governmental agencies and interested parties. If amendments are deemed desirable, the amendment procedure as described in Section 12-100 shall be followed. During the intervening period between reviews, the Subdivision Administrator shall maintain a list of possible amendments which may be periodically brought to his or her attention.
102 Judicial Review. As provided by K.S.A. 12-760, as amended, any ordinance, regulation or decision provided for or authorized by these regulations shall be reasonable and any person aggrieved thereby may have the reasonableness of any decision determined by bringing an action against the City within 30 days after a final decision is made by the City. Such action shall be brought in the Sedgwick County District Court.
12-1
ARTICLE 13. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE
100 Severability. If any part or provision of these regulations is adjudged unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, then such part or provision shall be considered separately and apart from the remaining parts or provisions of these regulations, and said part or provision to be completely severable from the remainder of these regulations, and the remainder provisions of these regulations shall remain in full force and effect.
101 Effective Date. These regulations shall be in full force and effect from and after their adoption by the Planning Commission, approval by the Governing Body by an ordinance incorporating these regulations by reference and publication of such ordinance in the official city newspaper.
