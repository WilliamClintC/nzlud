§ 1.13.010  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   The enforcement of the Alhambra Municipal Code is vital to the
protection of the public’s health, safety, and quality of life. Under Cal.
Gov’t Code § 53069.4, the city is authorized to adopt an administrative
citation process, which process offers an alternative method of enforcing
code violations. This chapter provides for administrative citation remedies,
which are in addition to all other legal remedies, criminal or civil, which
may be pursued by the city to address any violation of this code, including
any codes adopted by reference, or other public nuisance. This chapter
establishes an administrative citation process and monetary penalties to
encourage and expedite compliance with the provisions of the code. The use of
this chapter is also intended to minimize the expense and delay associated
with pursuing code violations through the civil or criminal justice system.

(Ord. 4544, passed 5-26-09)



§ 1.13.050  COMPLIANCE ORDER.



   (A)   Before issuing an administrative citation for any violation of
building, plumbing, electrical, or similar zoning regulation set forth in
this code or incorporated by reference, the enforcement officer must first
issue a written compliance order to the person(s) responsible for the
violation unless the violation constitutes an immediate threat to pubic

collection of unpaid fines and costs (which includes but is not limited to
inspection and re-inspection time) can be enforced as a lien against the
property where the violation occurs and that an unpaid lien can result in the
property being involuntarily sold.



(Ord. 4544, passed 5-26-09)



§ 1.13.060  AMOUNT OF ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION FINES.

previous administrative citation.



   (B)   A penalty of 10% will be added on any delinquent fines on the
last day of each month after the due date.



   (C)   In addition to the late penalty provided by this section,
delinquent fines will accrue interest at the rate of 1% per month, exclusive
of penalties, from the due date.



(Ord. 4544, passed 5-26-09)



§ 1.13.070  SATISFACTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION.



   (A)   Upon receipt of an administrative citation, the responsible
party must do the following:



      (1)   Pay the fine within 30 days from the date of the
administrative citation. All fines assessed are payable to the City Clerk.
Payment of a fine does not excuse or discharge the failure to correct the
violation nor will it bar further enforcement action by the City Clerk; and



      (2)   Correct and abate the violation. If the offense is a
continuing violation and the responsible party fails to properly correct and
abate the violation, fines will accrue for each day until the abatement is
properly verified by the city. Additionally, subsequent administrative
citations may be issued for the same violation. The amount of the fine for
failure to correct the violation will increase at the rate specified in this
chapter or as established by City Council resolution.



   (B)   At any time following 30 days after the issuance of the
administrative citation, the city may deliver a collection bill to the
responsible party requiring payment for all outstanding amounts owed for the
violation, including costs, the amount due for the initial violation and any
accrual of daily fines from the date the citation was issued to the date the
abatement of the offense is properly verified by the city (if applicable),
plus any appropriate late payment charge, less any amount remitted pursuant
to subsection (A) of this section.



   (C)   The abatement of a continuing violation must be verified by an
enforcement officer. The responsible party must contact by phone, the
enforcement officer who issued the citation and schedule an inspection. Fines
will accrue until the abatement is verified, less any days delayed by action
of the city in scheduling such inspection.



(Ord. 4544, passed 5-26-09)



§ 1.13.080  COLLECTION OF UNPAID FINES AND PENALTIES.



   (A)   The failure of any person to pay a fine, costs or penalty
assessed by administrative citation within the time specified on the citation
constitutes a debt to the city. To enforce that debt, the city may file a
civil action, lien the subject property as set forth below, or pursue any
other legal remedy to collect such debt. A person who fails to pay any fine
or other charge owed to the city under this chapter is liable in any action
brought by the city for all costs incurred in securing payment of the
delinquent amount, including, but not limited to, administrative costs and
attorneys’ fees. Such collection costs are in addition to any fines,
interest, and late charges.



   (B)   In addition to any other legal remedy, the city may place a
lien on property that is the subject of a citation if the administrative
citation has been issued to the property owner. The following procedure will
apply:



      (1)   The Finance Director may initiate proceedings to record
a lien against the subject property;



      (2)   Before recording the lien, the Finance Director shall
submit a report to the City Clerk stating the amounts due and owing. The
report may include a fee, as established by City Council resolution, for the
administrative costs associated with the preparation and recordation of the
lien;



      (3)   The City Clerk shall fix a time, date and place for a
hearing before the City Manager to consider the report and any protests or
objections to it;



      (4)   The City Clerk must serve the property owner with a
hearing notice not less than ten days before the hearing date. The notice
must set forth the amount of the delinquent administrative fine, and any
penalties and interest that is due. Notice must be delivered first-class
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the property owner’s address as it
appears on the last equalized assessment roll or supplemental roll of the
County of Los Angeles, whichever is more current. Service by mail is
effective on the date of mailing and failure of property owner to actually
receive notice does not affect its validity;



      (5)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Finance Director
may adopt a report confirming, discharging, or modifying the lien amount;



      (6)   Following the adoption of the report imposing a lien,
the City Clerk shall cause the lien to be filed in the County Recorder’s
Office;



      (7)   After confirmation and recordation, the city shall
impose a special assessment against the property that is the subject of
administrative citation by presenting a copy of the lien to the County Tax
Collector to add the amount of the lien to the next regular property tax
bills levied against the parcel for municipal purposes. This amount will be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary property taxes
are collected, and will be subject to the same penalties and procedures under
foreclosure and sale as provided for with ordinary municipal taxes. Or, after
recording, the lien may be foreclosed by judicial or other sale in the manner
and means provided by law; and



      (8)   Once the city receives full payment for outstanding
principal, penalties, and costs related to a lien, the City Clerk will cause
to be recorded a notice of satisfaction or provide the property owner with a
notice of satisfaction for recordation at the County Recorder’s Office.
This notice of satisfaction will cancel the city’s lien.



(Ord. 4544, passed 5-26-09)



§ 1.13.090  REQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING.



   (A)   Any person receiving an administrative citation may appeal the
citation within ten calendar days after the issuance date of the
administrative citation. The appeal must be in writing and must indicate the
appellant’s full name, telephone number, mailing address, specify the basis
for the appeal in detail, and must be filed at the City Clerk’s office. Any
request for hearing must be accompanied by an advance deposit of the fine
assessed by the citation for the initial violation, unless waived by
subsection (C) of this section. If it is determined after a hearing that
there was no violation as charged in the administrative citation, the advance
deposit will be refunded.



   (B)   A request for hearing will not postpone or avoid the
requirement of a responsible person to correct and abate a violation nor toll
the daily fines accruing for a continuing violation until the correction and
abatement of the offense is properly verified by the city. In the event the
hearing officer upholds the citation, the responsible person will be liable
for the total fines accrued from the issuance of the citation to the date the
abatement is properly verified by the city.



   (C)   A person seeking an administrative hearing may request a
hardship waiver of the monetary fine by filing a request in writing with the
City Clerk’s office, which must be signed under penalty of perjury. The
request must be submitted along with the request for hearing. The person
requesting the waiver bears the burden of establishing that such person does
not have the financial ability to make the deposit. The request will be
decided by the city manager within three business days from date the request
is received, unless otherwise extended by the City Manager. The City
Manager’s decision is final. The applicant will be notified by telephone,
facsimile, or pursuant to § 1.13.030. The filing of a request for hardship
waiver does not extend the time to file for an administrative hearing or pay
the fine when due. If the request for hardship waiver is denied, an
administrative, hearing will not be scheduled unless the monetary fine is
paid within five business days following the City Manager’s determination
on the request for a hardship waiver.



   (D)   As soon as practicable after receiving written notice of
appeal, the City Manager shall fix a date, time and place for the hearing
before a hearing officer. Hearings shall take place once per month at a set
time and date, unless the city finds it necessary to conduct hearings more
frequently or less frequently. The city shall notify the person requesting
the hearing pursuant to § 1.13.030, at least ten days prior to the date of
the hearing and give that person any additional written reports filed
concerning the violation that are provided to the hearing officer.



   (E)   Failure of any person with an interest in the property, or
other responsible party, to receive such properly addressed or served notice
of hearing shall not affect the validity of any proceedings under this
chapter.



   (F)   Failure of any responsible party to file an appeal in
accordance with the provisions of this section shall constitute a waiver of
that responsible party’s rights to administrative determination of the
merits of the administrative citation and the amount of the monetary fine. If
no appeal is filed, the administrative citation shall be deemed a final
administrative order and a failure to exhaust the responsible party’s
administrative remedies.



(Ord. 4544, passed 5-26-09)



§ 1.13.100  ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING PROCEDURE.



   (A)   The City Manager shall designate a hearing officer or hearing
officers to conduct the appeal hearing of an administrative citation issued
pursuant to this chapter.



   (B)   No hearing to contest an administrative citation before a
hearing officer will be held until a request for hearing has been completed
and submitted, and the monetary fine has been deposited in advance, unless a
hardship waiver is granted in accordance with § 1.13.090(C).



   (C)   The hearing officer may only consider evidence that is
relevant to whether the violation occurred and whether the responsible party
has created, caused or maintained the violation of this code on the date
specified in the administrative citation.



   (D)   At least ten days prior to the hearing, the city must provide
the recipient of an administrative citation with a copy of the citation, and
any other documents to be submitted to the hearing officer. Formal rules of
evidence will not apply.



   (E)   The person appealing the administrative citation will be given
the opportunity to testify and present witnesses and evidence concerning the
administrative citation.



   (F)   Unless requested in advance by the person appealing the
administrative citation, neither the enforcement officer nor any other
representative of the city is required to attend the hearing, provided that
any such appearance may be made at the discretion of the enforcement officer
or City Manager.



   (G)   The failure of any recipient of an administrative citation to
appear at the administrative citation hearing will constitute a forfeiture of
the fine and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the order of
the citation will become the final determination.



   (H)   The administrative citation and any additional documents
submitted by the enforcement officer to the hearing officer will constitute
prima facie evidence of the violation and the respective facts contained in
those documents.



   (I)   The hearing officer may continue the hearing and request
additional information from the enforcement officer or the recipient of the
administrative citation prior to issuing a written decision.



   (J)   The hearing officer shall administer oaths and accept
testimony under penalty of perjury relating to the violation.



(Ord. 4544, passed 5-26-09)



§ 1.13.110  ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING DECISION.



   (A)   After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted
at the hearing, the hearing officer must issue a written decision within five
business days after the hearing, unless otherwise extended by the city, to
uphold the order and deny the appeal, or modify the order. The hearing
officer must identify and describe the reasons for that decision. The hearing
officer will use preponderance of evidence as the standard of evidence in
deciding issues. The decision of the hearing officer will be final.



   (B)   If the hearing officer determines that the administrative
citation should be upheld and appeal denied, any monetary fine on deposit
with the city will be retained by the city. The hearing officer may also
impose conditions and deadlines to correct the violation or require payment
of any outstanding fines, penalties, and interest.



   (C)   If the hearing officer determines that the order should be
modified, the city will promptly take the corrective action identified in the
hearing officer’s decision.



   (D)   The city shall preserve all exhibits submitted by the parties
and shall serve the decision by first class mail on the appellant within ten
days after receipt of the decision.

   The prevailing party will be entitled to recovery of costs (including
the cost of the hearing officer) and attorneys fees incurred.

CHAPTER 2.25:  COMMUNITY
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY



Section



   2.25.010   Findings



   2.25.020   Declaration of policy



   2.25.030   Declaration of need



   2.25.040   Council declaration



§ 2.25.010  FINDINGS.



   (A)   The Planning Commission and the City Council have caused to be
prepared, approved and adopted a general community plan for the city in
conformity with the requirements of the California Community Redevelopment
Law.



   (B)   The Planning Commission and other city agencies have also made
extensive investigations and comprehensive surveys, which disclose that
blighted areas exist within the city and which constitute either social or
economic liabilities, or both, requiring redevelopment in the interest of the
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city in particular,
and the people of the state generally. The blighted areas are characterized
by one or more of the following conditions:



      (1)   The existence of buildings and struc-tures, either used
or intended to be used for living, commercial, industrial or other purposes,
or any combination of such uses, which by reason of age, obsolescence,
deterioration, dilapidation, mixed character or shifting of uses to which
they are put, or any combination of such factors and characteristics, are
unsuitable for occupation for existing residential, commercial, industrial or
other purposes.



      (2)   In such blighted areas, economic dis-location,
deterioration or disuse exist as a result of faulty planning.



      (3)   In some areas, depreciated values, impaired investments
and economic maladjustments exist to such an extent that capacity to pay
taxes is reduced and tax receipts are inadequate in relation to the cost of
public services rendered.



      (4)   The existence of blighted areas charac-terized by any or
all of such conditions, separately or collectively, constitutes a serious and
growing menace which is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety
and welfare of the people of the city in particular, and to the people of the
state generally.



   (C)   Such areas present difficulties and handicaps which are beyond
remedy and control solely by regulatory processes in the exercise of the
police power. They contribute substantially and increasingly to the problems
of and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures for the
preservation of the public health and safety and the maintaining of adequate
police, fire and accident protection, and other public services and
facilities. The benefits which will result from the remedying of these
conditions and the redevelopment of these areas of blight will accrue to all
the inhabitants and property owners in the city.



   (D)   Such conditions of blight tend to cause further obsolescence,
deterioration and disuse because of the lack of incentive to the individual
landowner and his inability to improve, modernize or rehabilitate his own
particular property while the condition of the neighboring properties remains
unchanged. As a consequence the process of deterioration of a blighted area
frequently cannot be halted or corrected except by redeveloping the entire
area, or substantial portions thereof. In most instances, the lands are held
in divided and widely scattered ownerships. In many such instances, it is so
difficult and costly that it is uneconomic and, as a practical matter,
impossible for individual owners, independently or collectively, to undertake
to remedy such conditions because of lack of the legal power necessary for,
and the excessive costs involved in, the private acquisition of the real
property of the area.



('86 Code, § 2.25.010) (Ord. 3364, passed  - - )



§ 2.25.020  DECLARATION OF POLICY.



   For the reasons set forth herein, the following is hereby declared to
be the policy of the city:



   (A)   It is the city's intent to protect and promote sound
development and redevelopment of blighted areas within the city and the
general welfare of the inhabitants of the community by remedying such
injurious conditions through the employment of all means appropriate for that
purpose;



   (B)   Whenever the redevelopment of blighted areas cannot be
accomplished by private enterprise alone, without public participation and
assistance in the acquisition of land, in planning and in the financing of
land assembly, in the work of clearance and in the making of improvements
necessary therefor, it is in the public interest to employ the power of
eminent domain to advance or expend public funds for these purposes and to
provide a means whereby the blighted areas within the city may be redeveloped
or rehabilitated;



   (C)   The redevelopment of such blighted areas and the provision for
appropriate continuing land use and construction policies therein constitute
public uses and purposes for which public money should be advanced or
expended and private property acquired, and are governmental functions of
state and municipal concern in the interest of the health, safety and welfare
of the people of the state generally and of the people of the city, in which
such areas exist, in particular;



   (D)   It is in the public interest that work on such projects be
commenced as soon as possible.



('86 Code, § 2.25.020) (Ord. 3364, passed  - - )



§ 2.25.030  DECLARATION OF NEED.



   The Council hereby finds and declares that there is need for a
community redevelopment agency to function in the city, pursuant to the
provisions of the Community Redevelopment Law of the state of California.



('86 Code, § 2.25.030) (Ord. 3364, passed  - - )

§ 2.26.010  FINDINGS.



   (A)   The California Industrial Development Financing Act, Title 10
(commencing with Cal Gov't Code § 91500), establishes the power and
authority in the City Council to appoint its members to be the Board of
Directors of an industrial development authority of the city for the
achievement of specified public purposes.



   (B)   The public purposes are to increase oppor-tunities for useful
employment or otherwise con-tribute to economic development.



   (C)   The need for the establishment of an industrial development
authority of which the City Council will serve as Board of Directors in the
achievement of such purposes is based upon findings that industry requires
the new and alternative method of capital financing that such authorities can
provide in order for it to undertake the acquisition, construc-tion or
rehabilitation of facilities, the use of which will serve those public
purposes.



('86 Code, § 2.26.010) (Ord. 3970, passed  - - )



§ 2.26.020  DECLARATION OF NEED.



   (A)   The City Council hereby finds and declares that there is a
need in the city for the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of
facilities for the use of industry which will increase employment
oppor-tunities or otherwise contribute to economic develop-ment; and,
further, the new and alternative method of capital financing that industrial
development authorities can provide will aid in satisfying that need.



   (B)   The City Council hereby further finds and declares that there
is a need in the city for an industrial development authority, of which the
City Council shall serve as Board of Directors, to provide industry with an
alternative and additional method of financing in accordance with state
policy as set forth in the California Industrial Development Act, Cal. Gov't
Code §§ 91500 et seq.

plan shall be so developed and maintained that all positions sub-stantially

Officer to a more appropriate class in the same manner as originally
classified and allocated. Reclassification shall not be used to avoid

of recognized selection techniques; including, but not limited to,
achievement and aptitude tests, or other written tests, personal interviews,
performance tests, physical agility tests, evaluation of daily work
performance, work sampler, or any combination of these which will, in the
judgment of the Personnel Officer, test fairly the qualifications of
candidates. Physical, medical and psychological tests may be given as part of
any examination. In any examination, the Personnel Officer may include, in
addition to competitive tests, a qualifying test or tests, and set minimum
standards therefor.



   (E)   Conduct of examinations.  The Personnel Officer shall be
responsible for weighting the examinations and for the manner, methods, and
by whom examinations shall be prepared and admini-stered. The City Council
may contract with any competent agency or individual for the preparation and
administration of examinations.



   (F)   Scoring examinations and qualifying scores. A candidate's
score in a given examination shall be the average of his or her score for
each competitive part of the examination. Failure in one part of the
examination shall be grounds for declaring such applicant as failing the
entire examination or as disqualified for subsequent parts of the examination.



   (G)   Physical examinations.  Applicants will be advised of
physical requirements and may be offered employment conditioned upon their
passing a physical examination designed to test for job-related physical
requirements.



   (H)   Notification of examination results.  Each candidate in an
examination shall be given written notice of whether he or she passed or
failed. Where allowed by law or contract, examinees competing for promotional
positions may examine, within five days of the examination date, question and
answer sheets and rating notes with which to review and verify the accuracy
of the scoring process.

remain in effect for six months, unless abolished sooner by the Personnel
Officer because it contains less than three eligibles. Employment lists may
be extended, prior to their expiration, upon the recommendation of the
affected department head and with the approval of the Personnel Officer, for
additional six-month periods, but in no event shall an employment list remain
in effect for more than two years.

§ 2.48.110  RULE X: METHODS OF FILLING VACANCIES.



   (A)   Types of appointments. All vacancies in the classified service
shall be filled by rehire, transfer, demotion, or from eligibles on an
appropriate employment list in the absence of persons eligible for
appointment in these ways, provisional, or acting appointments may be made in
accordance with these rules.



   (B)   Notice to Personnel Officer.  Whenever a vacancy in the
classified service is to be filled, the affected department head shall notify
the Personnel Officer. The Personnel Officer shall advise the concerned
department head as to the availability of applicants for reinstatement,
transfer, or demotion and of eligibles on employment lists for the class. The
department head shall then indicate a preference as to how the vacancy should
be filled, with the exception, however, that if a reemployment list exists
for the class, it shall be used to fill the vacancy.



   (C)   Appointments from lists.  The concerned department head may
select an eligible from the three persons holding the highest rating on an
employment list. Whenever there are fewer than three names on a promotional
or open list, the department head may request that an appointment be made
from such eligibles or request the establishment of a new list. Upon making
his selection, the department head shall immediately notify the Personnel
Officer. The Personnel Officer shall then notify the appointing authority,
and upon his concurrence, shall thereupon notify the person to be appointed.



   (D)   Promotion. 



      (1)   Insofar as is practicable and consistent with the best
interest of the city, vacancies within the classified service shall be filled
by promotion from within the classified service as well as from city
employees not part of the classified service, after a closed promotional
examination has been given and a promotional list established.



      (2)   If, in the opinion of the concerned department head
prior to the examination process, a vacancy in the position could be better
filled by an open examination instead of a promotional examination, the
department head may request the Personnel Officer to arrange for an open
examination and for the preparation and certification of an eligible list. In
addition, any city employee may participate in an open examination.



   (E)   Transfer.  An employee may be transferred at any time from
one position to another in the same or comparable class. No person may be
transferred to a position for which he does not possess the minimum
qualifications.



   (F)   Rehire. An employee who has resigned in good standing may be
rehired without examination within two years after the effective date of his
or her resignation to a position in his former or comparable class. A rehired
employee shall serve a probationary period and in all respects be treated as
a new employee.



   (G)   Provisional appointment.  In the absence of employment lists
and upon recommendation of the personnel officer, a provisional appointment
may be made by the appointing authority of a person meeting the minimum
training and experience qualifications for the position. An employment list
shall be estab-lished within six months for any position filled by
provisional appointment. For purposes of classifica-tion and compensation,
provisional appointees have the same status as hourly or temporary employees,
except that regular employees on provisional appoint-ment to a higher class
shall continue to receive supplemental benefits.



   (H)   Acting appointment.  The appointing authority may temporarily
appoint a regular employee who possesses the minimum qualifications for a
higher class to act in that higher class and perform essentially the full
range of duties allocated to a position in that higher class as needed to
fill in for a regular employee. Acting assignments shall not exceed six
months.

   (A)   Length of probationary period. 



      (1)   All original, reinstatement and promo-tional
appointments shall be subject to a probationary period of one year. In each
case, the appointee shall be informed on the length of the probationary
period before he or she begins service. A leave of absence, other than
vacation, in excess of two weeks shall cause the probationary period to be
extended by the length of such leave.



      (2)   Prior to expiration of an employee's probationary
period, the employee's supervisor with the approval of his department head,
shall recommend to the appointing authority that one of the following actions
be taken:



         (a)   Grant the employee permanent status.



         (b)   Extend the probationary period for a period not to
exceed six months.



         (c)   Terminate original appointment employee or return
promotional probationary employee to his former class.



      (3)   Notification to the Personnel Officer of the recommended
action shall be accomplished by a performance evaluation on the employee
completed within the 30-day period immediately preceding the date when the
employee's probationary period is due to expire.



   (B)   Objective of the probationary period.  The probationary
period is part of the examination process and shall be utilized for closely
observing the employee's work and for securing the most effective adjustment
of a new employee to his position.



   (C)   Termination of probationer.  During the probationary period,
an employee may be terminated or rejected without cause. Any employee
rejected during, or at the expiration of, a probationary period following a
promotional appointment shall be reinstated to the position from which he or
she was promoted, and no probation period shall be served if the employee
held permanent status in the position.

§ 2.48.130  RULE XII: ATTENDANCE AND LEAVES.



   (A)   Leave of absence without pay.  The Personnel Officer may
grant an employee a leave of absence without pay for a period not to exceed
six months. Any leave of absence for a period longer than six months may be
approved at the discretion of the City Council. Upon expiration of an
approved leave, the employee shall be reinstated in the position held at the
time leave was granted. Failure of an employee on leave to report promptly at
its expiration shall be cause for discharge. An employee on a leave of
absence in excess of two weeks shall not receive or accrue any employee
benefits.



   (B)   Attendance.  Employees shall be in attendance at their work
in accordance with rules regarding hours of work, holidays and leaves.
Failure on the part of an employee, absent without leave, to return to duty
after receipt of notice to return shall be cause for discipline. The
preceding notwithstanding, an employee absent without leave for three
consecu-tive work days shall be discharged unless the employee can present
justification acceptable to the city for such absence.



   (C)   Additional employment.  Any full-time employee desiring to
accept employment in addition to his city employment shall secure the
approval of the appointing authority and Personnel Officer. The employee may
be required to furnish proofs that both he or she and the secondary employer
will insure against all acts relating to the additional employment and hold
the city harmless from liability arising out of the acts. Such approval shall
not be given if the employment is incompatible with his or her city
responsibilities. The incompatibility may arise from either the time or
nature of the outside employment. In determining incompatibility, it shall be
recognized that many city positions require employees to be available at
times additional to their regular working hours.

the employee in his or her present position shall be considered city business
and may be conducted during or after regular working hours. Training to
prepare an employee for promotion shall be on the employee's own time unless
it is to the city's best interest to use work time, as determined by the
respective department head with the approval of the Personnel Officer.



   (C)   Credit for training.  Participation in the successful
completion of training courses and activities may be considered in making

employee shall be given prior notice of proposed disciplinary action, except
reprimands. Notification shall include a statement of the proposed action and
the reasons therefor, together with the right to request the materials upon

prior review unfeasible. In this event, the review shall be conducted within
a reasonable period of time after the effective date of the disciplinary
action.



      (2)   Administrative review process. A department head
considering disciplinary action subject to the administrative review process

the meeting, the department head shall concurrently serve a written decision
upon the employee and the Personnel Officer.



         (b)   When the dismissal of a permanent employee is
under consideration, the appointing authority, or his or her designee, shall
participate in the meeting and must concur in the decision of the department
head, if the department head decides to terminate the employee before the
employee is served with the written decision. The written decision of the
department head shall be in the form of a notice of whatever action the
department head has decided upon and shall be served upon the affected
employee, with a copy of same being filed concurrently with the Personnel
Officer and the Civil Service Commission.

of Regulations (collectively, regulations of the Office of Administrative

rule on the admission and exclusion of evidence, and advise the Commission on
matters of law that are required to be within the jurisdiction of the ALJ
pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act or regulations of the Office of
Administrative Hearings. The Commission shall exercise all other powers
relating to the conduct of the hearing. A Commissioner who does not hear all
of the evidence shall not vote on the decision.



      (2)   Hearing. The firefighter shall appear personally, unless
physically unable to do so, at the time and place of the hearing. The
firefighter may be represented by any person he or she may choose and may
present any relevant evidence. Cross-examination of witnesses shall be
permitted. The conduct and decorum of the hearing shall be under the control
of the Commission or ALJ with due regard to the rights and privileges of the
parties appearing before the Commission and the ALJ.



      (3)   Public hearings. Appeal hearings shall be conducted in

(Ord. 4671, passed 5-26-15)



§ 2.48.190  RULE XVIII: SEPARATION FROM CITY SERVICE.



   (A)   Dismissal.  A permanent employee in the classified service
may be dismissed by the appointing authority only for cause as set forth in
§ 2.48.170 (Rule XVI) of this code. Such dismissal shall be made by the
appointing authority with the approval of the personnel officer.



   (B)   Layoff.



      (1)   Commission to provide plan for layoff or reduction. For
economic reasons, the Council may abolish any position in the classified
civil service.  The Commission shall administer a plan which shall provide
for layoff and reduction on the basis of seniority and for the establishment
of reemployment lists.



      (2)   Layoff and reduction procedure.  The head of the
department in which a layoff is to be made shall notify the personnel officer
in writing of the number of employees to be laid off. The Personnel Officer
shall then determine the employees who shall be reduced and/or laid off and
so inform the department head in writing. The department head shall then
immediately notify the employees who are to be reduced and/or laid off,
giving them the effective date of such action.



      (3)   Emergency and temporary employees to be laid off
first.  Emergency and temporary employees in a classification shall be laid
off before probationary or permanent employees.



      (4)   Plan for lay off and reduction.  Layoff in a
classification shall take place in inverse order of seniority credit within
the classification from which an employee or employees are to be laid off. If
there is a class of positions in a lower rank that is in the same regular
promotional line for which the employee meets the requirements, the employee
shall be reduced to such lower-ranking class, provided he has greater
combined seniority in the lower ranking class and higher classes than other
employees in that lower-ranking class. The employee in the lower-ranking
class with the least seniority credit shall in turn be laid off or reduced in
the same manner, to the end that the last person employed in the
lowest-ranking class shall be the person laid off.



      (5)   Plan for computing seniority. 



         (a)   Seniority credit shall be allowed only for
continuous service in the class in which the employee is serving or in higher
ranking classes in which he has served. No seniority credit shall be allowed
for service prior to a break in the employee's employment with the city.
Authorized leaves of absence shall not count as breaks in service. However,
time while on leave shall not count toward seniority credit, except in the
case of sick leave, military leave, and leave for which an employee receives
disability payments under workmen's compensation.



         (b)   After temporary and emergency employees have been
separated, seniority credit for probationary and permanent employees shall
not include service as temporary and emergency employees.



      (6)   Layoffs when there are ties in seniority credit. In the
event of ties in seniority credit, the employee who stands the highest on the
eligible list from which the employees were appointed shall be considered to
have the greatest seniority credit. In the event that the tied employees were
appointed from separate lists, the employee on the list with the highest
priority shall be considered to have the greatest seniority credit.



      (7)   Establishment of reemployment lists. Permanent and
probationary employees who are laid off and reduced shall have their names
placed on reemployment lists in the reverse order of layoff or reduction.



      (8)   Reemployment of employees laid off or reduced.  If,
within two years, a vacancy occurs in any existing class having the same or
substantially similar qualifications as the position abolished or vacated,
the employee laid off or reduced shall have the right to appointment to such
vacancy, unless such person shall file a written waiver with the Personnel
Officer: or fails to report for work within two weeks of notice of
appointment.



      (9)   Reclassification lists.  The employee on the
reemployment list who has the greatest seniority shall be appointed to the
first vacant position in the class for which the list exists unless he waives
appointment. The reclassification or reallocation of all positions in a given
class automatically reclassifies the reemployment list.



   (C)   Resignation.  An employee wishing to leave the classified
service in good standing shall file with the appointing authority a written
resignation stating the effective date and the reasons for leaving. Such
resignation should be filed at least two weeks before leaving the service,
unless such time limit is waived by the appointing authority. A statement as
to the resigned employee's service performance and other pertinent
information shall be forwarded by the concerned department head to the
Personnel Officer. Failure to give notice as required hereby may be cause for
denying future employment by the city. The department head may rescind a
resignation notice on request of the employee.

§ 2.50.020  STANDARD PERIOD OF WORK.



   Pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act and except as provided in §
2.50.010(B) of this code, the standard period of work for city employees
shall be as follows:



   (A)   Nonsafety personnel. 



      (1)   The standard work period for each nonsafety city
employee shall consist of seven days in each week for a total of not to
exceed 40 hours of actual work, plus the employee's meal periods during each
such work week; provided, however, that any head of a department under whose
supervision labor is performed may, when public necessity demands, require
any of his or her subordinates to work more than a standard work period in
any week.



      (2)   The work period for all such employees who work a Monday
through Sunday work week shall commence at one minute after 12:00 a.m. on
Monday of each week. All such employees working a “9/80” schedule, each
two weeks (14 days), shall have two sets of two consecutive days off. Each of
these sets shall have five days between them. Each of the employees on the
“9/80” schedule shall work eight 9-hour days and one 8-hour day. The
employee shall then have the remaining day of the fourteen days off.  The
eight hour day worked and the remaining day off shall be on the same day of
the week, one week apart. The work period for all employees working a
“9/80” work schedule shall commence on one minute after the midpoint of
the employee's work day on the eight-hour day worked. The work period for all

   (C)   Police safety employees.  The standard work period for

tour of duty for each such designated uniformed police officer shall be 12
hours and 30 minutes a day, including the meal period and briefing time, for
three days in each week, a total of 37½ hours. The tour of duty for the 28
day work period shall be 150 hours. If the uniformed officer works in excess
of the work period, but not more than 160, the officer shall be paid at a
straight time rate for those hours worked. Time worked over 160 hours in the
work period shall be calculated at the overtime rate. In the event an officer
does not work or is not assigned any additional hours beyond the 150 hour
tour of duty for the work period, the officer shall have ten hours of leave
time deducted from his or her leave time account. Any leave time which has
been accrued to the employee, with the exception of sick leave, shall be
available for such use by the employee. The standard work period for
designated plainclothes police officers shall be 28 consecutive days during
which the employee's tour of duty shall not exceed in the aggregate 171

to be worked by any employee, and no such change in the scheduling of days or
hours worked shall be deemed to constitute overtime, provided the total
number of hours and days does not exceed those specified as constituting the
standard work year, work period, work week and workday hereunder.

§ 2.50.040  ELECTIONS WITHIN THE CITY.



   (A)   The City Council does find, determine and declare as follows:



      (1)   The city is a Charter City lawfully formed pursuant to
the California Constitution, incorporated in 1903.



      (2)   The City Charter, adopted in 1915, governs the conduct
of the government within the city limits, including the conduct of
elections.  § 103 provides that elections for all purposes within the city
are of three types: general municipal elections, special elections and
primary nominating elections.



      (3)   § 105 provides that "Special elections shall be held
for such municipal purposes and at such times as the council may determine,
or at such times as are elsewhere provided in this charter..."



      (4)   § 61.4 vests the authority in the City Council to
"provide for the holding of municipal elections, give notice thereof,
establish and alter election precincts, as provided in this charter, and
appoint necessary election officers."



      (5)   The City Charter also governs elections of the city
school district and the city high school district.  § 84 of the charter
provides that "All territory included in the limits of the city school
district and the city high school district or that may hereafter be included

Elections Code, incorporated therein.  Any request for a special election by
the city school district or the city high school district may request that
such election be held on a specific date; provided such date is a Tuesday. 
The request for calling of such election must be provided to the City Council
no later than two weeks prior to the date that such election must be called
to permit the City Council to agendize the calling of such election as
required by the Brown Act.  Based upon the time reasonably necessary to
prepare and print election materials, the City Clerk, as elections official,
shall fix and determine a submission schedule for materials to be included in

sick leave credit for each working days absence on account of illness or
injury except as provided for in § 2.54.020 of this chapter.



   (C)   For Fire Department employees who work on a shift basis, 12

§ 2.54.012  MONETARY COMPENSATION IN LIEU OF SICK LEAVE.



   Monetary compensation shall be paid in lieu of or for unused sick leave
as provided in this section.



   (A)   On December 31 of each year, commencing December 31, 1970, any
appointive official or employee who has, on such date, accumulated a minimum
of 100 days of sick leave credit may elect to receive monetary compensation
at his or her then current pay rate in lieu of sick leave credit in the
maximum amount of one-half of his or her unused allowable sick leave for that
calendar year, but not to exceed a maximum six days' compensation for such
calendar year. Such monetary compensation shall not, however, exceed one-half
of the total number of days of such person's accumulated sick leave in excess
of 100 days.



      (1)   For purposes of computation of mone-tary compensation
hereunder, all sick leave used in any calendar year shall be charged against
sick leave credit accrued for that calendar year.



      (2)   There shall be deducted from such official's or
employee's accumulated sick leave credit the number of days of sick leave for
which compensa-tion is paid.



      (3)   Effective January 1, 1985, an individual need not be in
the employ of the city on December 31 of a calendar year in order to be
eligible to receive the distribution as described herein, provided that the
individual has completed his or her work schedule for the calendar year.



   (B)   Any appointive official or employee who has been in the employ
of the city for 15 years of continuous permanent service or more shall, upon
service or disability retirement, be entitled to monetary compensation for a
portion of his or her accumulated unused sick leave credit, computed as
follows:



      (1)   One percent of his or her accumulated unused sick leave
credit (up to a maximum of 100 days) shall be multiplied by the number of his
or her completed years of service (up to a maximum of 25 years), and the
resulting amount shall be multiplied by his or her then current daily
compensation rate. Such compensation shall in no event exceed 25 days' pay.



      (2)   Accumulated sick leave credit shall be lost permanently
when the employment of any official or employee is terminated for any reason
other than service or disability retirement.



      (3)   Such monetary compensation for sick leave shall be
payable only once to any one official or employee even if he or she should
later be reemployed by the city.



   (C)   For purposes of computation under divisions (A) and (B) above,
only complete unused days of sick leave shall be considered, but monetary
compensation payable therefor shall include payment for fractions of days.
For example, if an employee has 5€-days' unused allowable sick leave in a
calendar year, only five days shall be considered and the employee shall be
entitled to monetary compensation for 2½ days.

may be accrued up to a maximum of not to exceed 40 hours. Police non-sworn
employees may accrue up to a maximum of not to exceed 80 hours. Each

at the rate of 80% of his or her regular base pay, for the period of the
disability but not exceeding six months, commencing with the first day of

illness. Any regular, full-time city employee who receives worker's
compensation benefits for any portion of the six-month period shall be

continued period of temporary disability after the expiration of the
six-month period as provided for therein by charging accrued sick leave time,
accrued vacation time and/or accrued overtime to the difference between the
worker's compensation benefits he or she receives and his or her full salary.
The payment by the city to the employee of the difference between his or her
worker's compensation benefits and his or her full salary shall result in pro
rata reduction of accrued sick leave time, accrued vacation time and/or
accrued overtime available to the employee in increments of the closest
half-hour.

portion of his absence in excess of one year, whether or not he shall be
entitled to city pay therefor.

§ 3.08.040  PURPOSE.



   The City Council hereby declares that this chapter is adopted to
achieve the following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions
hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:



   (A)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in Cal. Rev & Tax. Code Part 1.5 of
Division 2;



   (B)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Part 1.5 of
Division 2;



   (C)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the
State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and
Use Taxes;



   (D)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be
administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with
the provisions of Cal. Rev & Tax. Code Part 1.5 of Division 2, mini-mize the
cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the
burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the
provisions of this chapter.

   Prior to the operative date this city shall contract with the State
Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration
and operation of this sales and use tax ordinance: provided, that if this
city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to
the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the
operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following
the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first
calendar quarter following the adoption of this chapter.

§ 3.08.060  SALES TAX.



   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail a tax

§ 3.08.070  PLACE OF SALE.



   For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at
the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property
sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination
or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross
receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges
are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which
delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business
in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at
which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.

of the property. The sales price shall include delivery charges when such

are inconsistent with the pro-visions of Cal. Rev & Tax. Code Part 1.5 of
Division 2, all of the provisions of Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Part 1 of Division

   In adopting the provisions of Cal. Rev. & Tax Code Part 1 of Division
2, wherever the state is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name
of this city shall be substituted therefor. The sub-stitution, however, shall
not be made when the word “state” is used as part of the title of the
State Controller, the State Treasurer, The State Board of Control, the State
Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State
of California; the substitution shall not be made when the result of that
substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city, or any
agency thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equaliza-tion, in
performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this
chapter; the substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but
not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of
the state  where the result of the substitution would be to provide an
exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other
consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt
from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain
subject to tax by the State under the provisions of Cal. Rev & Tax Code Part
1 of Division 2, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales,
storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would
not be subject to tax by the state under the  provisions of that Code; the
substitution shall not be made in Cal. Rev & Tax Code §§ 6701, 6702 (except
in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828; and the
substitution shall not be made for the word “state” in the phrase
“retailer engaged in business in this state” in Cal. Rev & Tax Code §
6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Cal. Rev & Tax Code § 6203.

§ 3.36.070  EMERGENCY PURCHASES.

defense.



      (3)   There is a breakdown in machinery or an essential
service that requires the immediate purchase of supplies, equipment and/or
services to protect the public health, welfare or safety.



      (4)   An essential departmental operation affecting the public
health, welfare or safety would be greatly hampered if the prescribed
purchasing procedure would cause an undue delay in procurement of the needed
item or service.



   (B)   In case of an emergency requiring immediate purchase of
supplies, equipment and/or service, the City Manager may authorize the
Director of Finance, or his or her designee, to secure, by the process set
forth in § 3.36.090, any supplies, equipment and/or services regardless of
the amount of the expenditure; provided, however, that the City Manager shall
report any such purchases that do not conform to the non-emergency purchasing
requirements set forth in this code to the City Council at the next possible
City Council meeting.

§ 3.36.110  SEALED BID PROCEDURE FOR PURCHASES GREATER THAN $50,000.



   Purchases of supplies and equipment of an estimated value greater than
$50,000 shall be by written contract with the lowest responsible bidder
pursuant to the procedure hereinafter prescribed.



   (A)   Notice inviting bids. Notices inviting bids shall be
advertised by the City Clerk, and shall include a general description of the
articles to be purchased, state where bid forms and specifications may be
secured, and the time and place for opening bids.



      (1)   Published notice. The City Clerk shall cause notices
inviting bids to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation five
days before the date of opening of the bids, or posted for five days in three
public places in the city designated by the City Council.



      (2)   Bidders’ list. The Director of Finance, or his or her
designee, shall also solicit sealed bids from all responsible prospective
suppliers whose names are on the bidders’ list, or who have made written
request that their names be added thereto.



   (B)   Bidder’s security.



      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by the City Manager prior to
the letting of public notice inviting bids, each bid shall be accompanied by
bidder’s security.



      (2)   Bidders shall be entitled to return of bid security;
provided, however, that a successful bidder shall forfeit his or her bid
security upon his or her refusal or failure to execute the contract within
ten days after the preparation and mailing of the contract, unless in the
latter event the city is solely responsible for the delay in executing the
contract. On refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the
contract, the City Council may award it to the next lowest responsible
bidder. In such event, if the City Council awards the contract to the next
lowest bidder, the amount of the lowest bidder’s security shall be applied
by the city to the contract price differential between the lowest bid and the
second lowest bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest
bidder.



   (C)   Bid opening procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the
city and shall be identified as “BID” on the envelope. Bids shall be
opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notices. A
tabulation of all bids received shall be available for public inspection
during regular business hours for a period of not less than 30 calendar days
after the bid opening. Once opened, the bids shall be public records.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any bid deemed non-responsive at the time of
bid opening shall not be kept by the city, and once deemed non-responsive,
shall be returned to the bidder. Grounds for determining a bid is
non-responsive include, but are not limited to, failure to provide the
required bid bond and failure to attend any mandatory walk through or pre-bid
meeting.



   (D)   Rejection of bids. At its discretion, the City Council may
reject any and all bids presented and readvertise for bids pursuant to the
procedure hereinabove prescribed.



   (E)   Award of contracts. Except as otherwise provided herein,
contracts shall be awarded by the City Council to the lowest responsible
bidder.



   (F)   Tie bids. If two or more bids received are for the same total
amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public
interest will not permit the delay or readvertising for bids, the City
Council, at its discretion, may accept the one it chooses.



   (G)   Performance bonds. The City Manager shall have the authority
to require a performance bond or materials and labor bond or bonds before
entering a contract in such amounts as he or she shall find reasonably
necessary to protect the best interests of the city. If the City Manager
requires such bond or bonds, the form and amount of same shall be described
in the notice inviting bids.

§ 3.38.010  PURPOSE.



   (A)   A competitive proposal process shall be used for contracts for
consulting and professional services over $3,500. The City Council finds and
declares that the competitive bid process is ill-suited for the selection of
consultants and professional services.



   (B)   Consultants are required for professional or technical
expertise, and for matters requiring specialized abilities or a high degree
of skill.



      (1)   Their numbers in relation to a particular skill or
expertise required may be comparatively limited.



      (2)   Where consultants are involved, the bidding process is
not likely to result in a lower price to the city, or to eliminate
unnecessary expense or delay.



   (C)   CONSULTANT CONTRACTS include any contract that is not a public
project or a contract for the purchase of supplies and equipment.



   (D)   Regardless of the method of contracting used, as set forth in
this chapter, the City Clerk shall assign such contract a contract number for
filing and tracking purposes.

consultant (including but not limited to, material testing service,
construction inspection services, testing, appraising, environmental,
planning, financial, legal, development processing, governmental operations,
special studies, and other services related thereto) without the necessity of
competitive bid, without notice of competitive bid, and without City Council
approval of the consultant’s contract, if the consultant’s total fee for
services and materials under the contract by which the consultant is engaged
$50,000 or less.



      (1)   For federally funded contracts, a minimum of two written
proposals shall be obtained from at least two qualified consultants.



      (2)   The consultant’s total fee must include all reasonably
foreseeable costs and work under the proposed contract.



      (3)   The proposed contract must include any reasonably
related work on the same project, and larger contracts shall not be divided
into smaller contracts, divided among multiple consultants, or divided by any
other method intended to avoid competitive bidding under § 3.38.030.



   (B)   The City Manager may designate a person or persons to exercise
any authority granted to him or her by this chapter.



   (C)   The City Manager, at his or her discretion, may utilize the
process set forth in § 3.38.030 for any award of a consulting contract of
$50,000 or less.

   (B)   Receipt of proposals and release as public records.

avoids disclosure of contents to competing consultants until after award of
the contract or final rejection of all proposals.

of the contract or final rejection of all proposals, all responses become
public records subject to disclosure.

      (7)   Contract approval.



         (a)   Contracts over $50,000. For contracts greater than

         (a)   In instances where the city effects a necessary
change in the project during the course of performance of the contract, the
consultant’s compensation may be adjusted by mutual written agreement in a
reasonable amount.

   This chapter may be cited as the city of Alhambra health facilities
financing law.



('86 Code, § 3.42.010) (Ord. 3982, passed  - - )



§ 3.42.020  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The Council hereby finds and declares that it is necessary,
essential, a public purpose and a municipal affair for the city to be
authorized to provide financing to health institutions that provide essential
services to residents of the city in order to aid such health institutions in
costs and thereby to enable such health institutions to establish lower rates
and charges than would otherwise prevail and to provide better service at
such rates and charges. Unless the city intervenes to provide such financing,
such rates and charges may increase at an ever accelerated pace because such
health institutions cannot obtain financing at equivalent cost from private
sources.



   (B)   In addition, the Council hereby finds and declares that there
is a great need for housing and health care for aged persons residing in the
city. It is necessary, essential, a public purpose, and a municipal affair
for the city to be authorized to provide financing to life care facilities
within the city in order to aid in the establishment of life care facilities
to provide care to the aged at prices they can afford. Unless the city
intervenes to provide such financing, life care facilities may not be
constructed and those which are constructed may be at higher rates and
charges than if such financing were provided and may therefore be too
expensive for many of the aged persons who require their services.



('86 Code, § 3.42.020) (Ord. 3982, passed  - - )

received by the City Treasurer not later than 45 days after the close of each
quarter of grantee's fiscal year.

accordance with § 4.04.1102, file a complete and accurate statement
certified by grantee's chief financial officer, indicating all gross revenues
for said year, listing every revenue source, and depicting gross revenue
computations. If the city has any concerns or issues relating to contents of
said report, the city shall have 60 days to notify grantee and request
additional information.  Grantee shall have 60 days to provide additional
input and data to resolve any concerns or issues to the city's
satisfaction.  Thereafter, the city may, at its sole discretion, request
that said statement be certified by an independent certified public
accountant, at grantee's sole cost; provided, however, that any such request
shall be made within 60 days after grantee's response is received.



   (E)   At any time during the term of a franchise, the city shall
have the right to conduct an independent audit of any and all records of
grantee that are related to gross revenue reports or computations.  Grantee
shall cooperate with any such audit making readily available any and all
information requested by the city relating to the audit.  In the event that
any such audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of five percent or
more, grantee shall pay all costs of said audit.  Grantee shall maintain in
a readily accessible place all such records for a minimum of four years after
any payment period that such record pertains to.



   (F)   In the event that any franchise fee payment is not made on or

the city as to the delinquency of such payment, a late fee in amount of five
percent of the delinquent amount shall be assessed.



   (G)   In the event grantee claims to have overpaid by more than five
percent the amount of franchise fee actually due during any given quarter, it
shall file an application with the city within one year after said payment
was made.  The failure to timely and properly make such claim as required
herein shall constitute a waiver by grantee of any right to such claimed
overpayment, whether by refund, offset, credit or any other accommodation. 
All such applications shall state the amount of claimed overpayment, the
reason for the claimed overpayment, and sufficient documentation to allow the
city to verify grantee's claim.  Upon request by the city, grantee shall
provide any further information that is deemed by the city to be relevant to
said claim.  All such applications shall be considered by the City Council,
and the City Council's decision with respect to such applications shall be
final.

§ 4.04.326  PROCEDURE FOR ADJUDICATION OF BREACHES OF THE FRANCHISE.



   (A)   Prior to imposing any sanction or penalty upon grantee,
including termination of the franchise, the City Council, the City Manager,
or their designee, shall demand in writing that grantee cure said breach
within a specified period, which period shall not be less than 30 days
following notification. Only 15 days notice shall be required in the case of

prescribe a notice less than 30 days consistent with the nature of the
emergency.



   (B)   Should grantee fail to provide sufficient written proof within
the specified cure period that corrective action has been taken, or that
corrective action is being actively and expeditiously pursued by grantee,
then the city may, in its sole discretion, elect to either place the issue of
termination or other penalty before the City Council or refer said issue to
an appropriate hearing officer for his/her determination.



(Ord. 4315, passed 11-12-96)



§ 4.04.327  CITY COUNCIL HEARING PROCEDURES.



   (A)   The City Council may hold a public meeting to determine
whether grantee materially breached the franchise and the appropriate penalty
to be imposed, if any, as a result of such breach.  The city shall cause to
be served upon grantee, at least ten days prior to the date of such meeting,
written notice of any intent to terminate the franchise and the time and
place of the meeting.  Grantee may appear at such meeting and present such
evidence, orally or in documented form, that it deems relevant and
appropriate to the Council's deliberations.  Based on the evidence presented
at the meeting, the City Council shall determine in its discretion whether or
not a material breach occurred and whether to terminate the franchise or take
other appropriate action.



   (B)   Should the City Council find that there has bean a material
breach of the franchise, but that termination  of the franchise is
inappropriate, then the Council may asses and levy monetary penalties against
grantee.  This penalty provision is separate and apart from the city's right
to enforce the provisions of the construction and performance bonds and
liquidated damages.



   (C)   The city shall cause grantee to be served with written notice
of any action taken by the City Council following such public hearing.  The
decision of the City Council as to such matters shall be final.

to make other determinations which are reasonably related to the franchise,
or to seek any other appropriate relief to which the city may be entitled, at
law or equity, as a result of any breach by grantee of its obligations under
the franchise.

enforcement, operation, breach, continuance or termination.  Such hearing
proceedings shall be initiated by the City Manager by written notice to
grantee.



   (B)   The hearing officer shall be a retired California Superior

written interrogatories, and shall be provided with an appropriate response
thereto, in the manner and form prescribed  by  California  Code  of 
Civil  Procedure Sections 2030 and 2031.  Any dispute that is not resolved
after a good faith attempt to "meet and confer" shall be submitted to the
hearing officer for resolution, and the hearing officer's determinations as
to such matter (which may include imposition of appropriate sanctions) shall
be final.  Neither party shall be required to make any other form of
discovery available to the other party.



   (E)   The hearing officer shall be vested with quasi-judicial
authority, and shall be empowered to (i) order grantee to undertake remedial
action to cure any breach of its obligations under its franchise, (ii) assess
liquidated damages and/or levy a penalty upon grantee in accordance with the
terms of this chapter and the franchise agreement, (iii) determine that
grantee has not violated any of its obligations under its franchise and/or
(iv) terminate the franchise.  The hearing officer shall enter conclusions

   (F)   Except as may be apportioned by the hearing officer in his or
her discretion, each party shall bear one-half of the fees and expenses of
the hearing officer, together with any other expenses of the hearing
proceedings incurred or approved by the hearing officer.  Each party shall
bear its own witness and attorneys' fees or other expenses.



   (G)   Failure of grantee to fully and promptly comply with an order
of a hearing officer shall be deemed a material breach of the franchise.

§ 4.04.330  FORCE MAJEURE; GRANTEE'S INABILITY TO PERFORM.

obligations of the franchise is prevented by any cause beyond grantee's
reasonable control, such inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused
and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed  as  a result  thereof, 
provided  grantee  has notified the city in writing within 30 days of its
discovery of the occurrence of such an event.  In such an instance, grantee
shall continue to use its best efforts to perform its obligations, cure any
breach and offer appropriate substitute performance where applicable.  For
the purpose of this section, causes or events not within the control of
grantee shall include, but not be limited to acts of God, strikes, sabotage,
riots or civil disturbances, epidemic, labor disputes, shortage of labor,
freight embargoes, shortages or unavailability of materials and supplies,
explosion, natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides and
fires, rationing, and power or communications failures, but shall not include
financial inability of grantee to perform or failure of grantee to obtain any
necessary permits or licenses from other governmental agencies or the right
to use the facilities of any public utility where such failure is due solely
to the acts or omissions of grantee.



(Ord. 4315, passed 11-12-96)

§ 4.04.334  LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.



   (A)   By acceptance of the franchise granted by the city, grantee
understands and agrees that failure to timely comply with any performance
requirements as stipulated in this chapter and the franchise agreement deemed
material by the city will result in damage to the city, and that it is and
will be impractical to determine the actual amount of such damage in the
event of delay or nonperformance; the franchise agreement shall include
provisions for liquidated damages to be paid by grantee, in amounts set forth
in the franchise agreement and chargeable to any security, including without
limitation a construction bond, performance bond or letter of credit, for any
breach of the franchise, including but not limited to any of the grounds for
material breach referred to in § 4.04.324 of this chapter.



   (B)   If the City Manager, following prior reasonable notice to
grantee to cure any problem that might result in liquidated damages,
concludes that grantee is in fact liable for liquidated damages, he or she
shall cause to be issued to grantee by certified mail a Notice of Intent to
Assess Liquidated Damages. The notice shall set forth the basis of the
assessment, and shall inform grantee that liquidated damages will be assessed
from the date of the notice unless the assessment notice is appealed for
hearing before the City Council, and the City Council rules that (l) there
was no violation, (2) the violation has been corrected, or (3) an extension
of time or other relief should be granted in lieu of liquidated damages.



   (C)   If grantee desires a hearing before the City Council, then
grantee shall send a written Notice of Appeal by certified mail to the City
Manager within ten days of the date on which the city sent the Notice of
Intention to Assess Liquidated Damages.  The hearing on grantee's appeal
shall be within 30 days of the date on which the city mailed the Notice of
Intention to Assess Liquidated Damages.  After the hearing, if the City
Council sustains in whole or in part the City Manager's Assessment of
Liquidated Damages, the City Manager may at any time thereafter draw upon any
of the security funds provided for by this chapter and/or the franchise
agreement.  Unless the City Council indicates to the contrary, said
liquidated damages shall be assessed beginning with the date on which the
city sent the Notice of the Intention to Assess Liquidated Damages and
continuing thereafter until such time as the violation ceases, as determined
by the City Manager.  Grantee may appeal any determination of the City
Council to an appropriate forum.



(Ord. 4315, passed 11-12-96)



§ 4.04.336  ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.



   The remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and in addition to
all other rights the city may have at law or equity or under the franchise,
which remedies may be exercised at any time.  In no event shall the amount
of any bond or letter of credit be construed to limit grantee's liability for
damages.



(Ord. 4315, passed 11-12-96)



§ 4.04.338  REMOVAL AND ABANDONMENT; PURCHASE OF SYSTEM.



   (A)   Subject to applicable law, in the event that a franchise is
terminated, revoked, or is not renewed upon expiration, then grantee shall,
upon demand of the city, and at its sole expense, promptly remove all or any
portion of its cable system.  In removing its cable system, grantee shall
refill, at its own expense, any excavation it made and leave all streets in
as good condition as that prevailing prior to grantee's removal of its cable
system without materially affecting the electrical or telephone cable, wires,
or attachments.  The liability, indemnity, insurance, security fund and
bonds required under the franchise shall continue in full force and effect
until such removal is accepted as complete by the city.



   (B)   Subject to applicable law, in the event that a franchise is
not renewed and the city acquires ownership of a cable system or effects a
transfer of ownership of a cable system to another person, any such
acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the
basis of the cable system valued as a going concern, but with no value
allocated to the franchise itself.  If a franchise is revoked for cause and
the city acquires ownership of the cable system or effects a transfer of
ownership of the cable system to another person, any such acquisition or
transfer shall be at an equitable price.  The value of a cable system (fair
market value or equitable price) shall be determined by an appraisal
committee consisting of three disinterested appraisers.  The city and
grantee shall each select at their individual discretion one appraiser, and
the two selected appraisers shall agree upon and appoint a third appraiser.

   (A)   Subject to applicable provisions of the United States
Bankruptcy Code, any franchise shall, at the option of the city, cease and
terminate 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take
over and conduct the business of grantee whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such
receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration
of said 120 days, or unless:



      (1)   Such receiver or trustee shall have, within 120 days
after his/her election or appointment, fully complied with all terms of the
franchise and remedied all breaches of the franchise or provided a plan for
the remedy of such breaches which is approved in writing by the city; and,



      (2)   Such receiver or trustee shall, within said 120 days,
execute an agreement duly approved by the Court having jurisdiction, whereby
such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every
term, provision and limitation of the franchise.



   (B)   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a
substantial part of a cable system, grantee shall notify the City Clerk of
such fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a
change in ownership of grantee has taken place and the provisions of this
chapter governing such changes shall apply.

shall cooperate with the city and the assignee in order to maintain
continuity of service to all subscribers.



   (B)   In the event grantee wilfully fails to operate the cable
system for a period of five consecutive days without prior approval of the
city, the city may, in its sole discretion, elect to operate the cable system
or designate an operator until grantee restores service under conditions
acceptable to the city, or until the cit selects a permanent operator. 
During the entire period while the city operates the cable system on behalf
of grantee, or causes another party to do so, the city shall be entitled to
collect any and all revenues from the operation of the cable system, and
grantee shall reimburse the city for all reasonable costs or damages in
excess of the revenues collected by the city that are caused by grantee's
failure to perform.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS



§ 4.04.1202  COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS.



   Subject to grantee's rights under its franchise agreement, grantee
shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the

grantee from performing any service, in conflict with the terms of the
franchise or any law or regulation of the city, then as soon as possible
following knowledge thereof, grantee shall notify the city of the point of
conflict believed to exist.

necessary to extend cable services to each residential parcel in the
subdivision. This division shall not apply to the conversion of existing
dwelling units to condominiums, community apartments, or stock cooperatives.



   (B)   Subject to all applicable federal and state laws, statutes and
regulations, in the event of multiple cable television operators desiring to
serve new residential developments in which the electric power and telephone
utilities are underground, the following procedure shall apply with respect
to access to and utilization of underground easements:



      (1)   The developer shall at its sole cost and expense contact
and survey every person who lawfully provides cable services and/or related
services to residents in the city using a cable system or similar
transmission line system (collectively, "cable operator"), and thereby
ascertain which such cable operator(s) desire or are required to service the
development.  The developer may establish a reasonable deadline to receive
such responses.  The final tract map shall indicate the cable operator(s)
who have agreed to serve the development.



      (2)   If one or more cable operator(s) desire to service the
development, they shall be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a
nondiscriminatory shared basis.



      (3)   The developer shall provide at least ten working days'
notice of the date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators
that have agreed to service the development.



      (4)   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to
compliance with Public Utilities Commission and Utility Standards.  If such
compliance is not possible, or if three or more cable operators desire to
provide service to the development, the developer shall provide a separate
trench for the transmission lines, with the entire cost shared among the
participating cable operators.  With the concurrence of the developer, the
affected utilities and the cable operators, alternative installation
procedures, such as the use of deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to
applicable law.



      (5)   Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the
trenches have been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching and
associated costs; provided that if the developer failed to provide such cable
operator timely written notice of the availability of such trenches as
required herein, then the developer shall reimburse the operator for such
costs.

   This chapter establishes procedures for the granting of franchises to
use and occupy the public rights-of-way for the purpose of constructing and
maintaining telecommunications equipment.  The city has the authority to
manage public property through its police power and other powers granted by
the Constitution and statutes of the United States and the State of
California, the Charter of the City of Alhambra and this code.  The
authority and procedures in this chapter are intended to ensure that
applicants seeking to occupy the public rights-of-way for the purpose of
constructing and maintaining telecommunications equipment are treated fairly
with sufficient consideration for due process, and that the city's
responsibility to control the use of public rights-of-way and to demand a
fair rate of compensation for the public for their use is preserved.  This
chapter does not provide for franchises for the right of any provider of
telecommunications services to operate within the city.



(Ord. 4387, passed 1-24-00)

(Ord. 4387, passed 1-24-00)



§ 4.06.040  FRANCHISE REQUIRED.



   (A)   Following the effective date of this chapter, no person shall
erect, install, construct, or maintain telecommunications equipment within
the public right-of-way unless the person has first obtained a franchise for
such use granted by the City Council under such terms and restrictions as are
set forth in this chapter and in the franchise agreement or has obtained some
other specific grant of authority from the city for the use of the public
right-of-way.

Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the California Public
Utilities Commission setting forth the terms and conditions under which such
person may operate such telecommunications equipment.



   (C)   The procedures set forth herein shall not be applied to any
facility, or the operation and maintenance of any facility, which is now or
hereafter otherwise specifically authorized to locate in the public
right-of-way by federal, state, or local laws, and for which all required
approvals by the city are properly obtained.  Any applicant for a franchise
who contends that its telecommunications services or telecommunications
system is subject to the provisions of Public Utilities Code Section 7901
shall bear the burden of proving the applicability of such statute to the
city.



   (D)   This chapter shall apply to any existing cable television
system operating pursuant to a franchise awarded by the city which the
franchisee uses to install, or maintain telecommunications equipment.  This
chapter shall also apply to any existing entity operating any
telecommunications equipment pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section 7901
to the extent that this chapter is not preempted by such statute.



   (E)   Before applying for a franchise to install, maintain, or
operate telecommunications equipment in a public right-of-way in the city,
the franchisee shall obtain all required regulatory approvals, permits,
authorizations or licenses (collectively "approvals") from the appropriate
federal, state and local authorities.  The applicant shall submit evidence
of such approvals to the city upon the written request of the city.  The
applicant shall also submit an application, in a form prescribed by the city,
and an application fee, in an amount set by resolution of the City Council,
as set forth in § 4.06.070 (A)(3) of this chapter.



   (F)   This chapter shall not be construed as a waiver of any codes,
ordinances, or regulations of the city or as a waiver of the city's right to
require a franchisee or any person utilizing the telecommunications services
to secure appropriate permits, licenses, or authorizations for such use.  No
fee or charge may be imposed upon a franchisee for any such permit or
authorization, other than the standard fees or charges generally applicable
to all persons for such permits or authorizations.  Such standard fee or
charge shall not be offset against the annual business license fee or
franchise fee a franchisee  is  required  to  pay  to  the  city 
pursuant to § 4.06.150 of this chapter.



   (G)   The procedures set forth in this section shall not be applied
to:



      (1)   Any existing telecommunications system, or the operation
and maintenance of any existing telecommunications system, which serves 100
or more parcels, residences, and/or business locations (or any combination
thereof) within the city, and for which all other required approvals by the
city are properly obtained.



      (2)   A planned telecommunications system if the construction
plans approved by the city show a system that will pass within 300 feet of
100 or more parcels, residences, and/or business locations in the city, and
will be capable of offering telecommunications services to more than 100
parcels, residences, and/or business locations in the city, or which will
prove wholesale access to providers of telecommunications services to 100 or
more parcels, residences, and/or business locations within the city, and for
which all other required approvals by the city are properly obtained.  For
planned telecommunications systems attempting to comply with this section,
any applicable franchise fee required by this chapter shall accrue, plus
interest at a 10% annual rate, but the city shall stay its collection of the

   (A)   5% or more of the franchisee's gross revenue from
telecommunications services; or



   (B)   (1)   A fee based on the length of the right-of-way
occupied or length of boring drilled expressed in feet multiplied by a base
rate of at least $.59 per lineal foot for rights-of-way zero  to 20 inches
wide and at least $.88 per lineal foot for rights-of-way greater than 20
inches wide plus the height of all above-ground telecommunications equipment
expressed in feet multiplied by a base rate of at least $900 per foot, or
fraction thereof, for each piece of equipment zero to ten feet in height and
at least $1800 per foot, or fraction thereof, for each piece of equipment
over ten feet in height.  The amount of each annual payment shall be
computed and revised each calendar year as follows: the base rate shall be
multiplied by the Consumer Price Index for the area, as published by the
United States Department of Labor for the month of September immediately
preceding the month in which payment is due and payable, and divided by the
Consumer Price Index for June 30, 1999, which is declared to be 100.0.  If
for any reason, this computation is not available, the city shall, in its
sole discretion, select a comparable method for adjusting the fee based upon
inflation.



      (2)   Such payments shall be computed from the effective date
of the franchise to and including the date of either actual removal of the
telecommunications equipment or the effective date of an approved abandonment
"in place" authorized by the city.  Franchise fees shall be paid quarterly
within 60 days after the close of each quarter for which the fees apply. The
city shall have the right, but not the obligation, to inspect, at city's
expense, franchisee's records to determine franchisee's compliance with this
chapter.  If any such inspection results in the city's determination that
franchisee has underpaid its franchisee fee by more than 5%,  then
franchisee shall reimburse the city for the city's costs in performing such
inspection.  Franchise fees impose by this section are in addition to any
other fees customarily imposed by the city including, but not limited to,
street cut fees and permit fees.

any right-of-way, a franchisee shall provide the City Engineer with a map
depicting the proposed location of any telecommunications equipment and
obtain any applicable permits or approvals to commence such proposed work. 
Franchisees shall also comply with all the provisions of Chapter 13.20,
including, but not limited to, the payment of any and all fees, except
franchisee shall not be required to pay the plan check fee required
therein.  Upon completion of its work regarding any portion of right-of-way,
franchisee shall restore such right-of-way to the same condition it was prior
to such work.  The city, in its sole discretion, shall direct the time,
place, and manner of installation and maintenance of telecommunications
equipment so as to minimize and mitigate any anticipated adverse impacts on
the public's use of the public rights-of-way.

by such percentage of change. In no event, however, shall any annual license
fee be less than those amounts set forth in the table.

   Commencing on January 1, 1989, and annually thereafter, the annual
license fees payable hereunder shall be adjusted in relation to the Consumer
Price Index issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States
Department of Labor for All Urban Consumers of the Greater Los Angeles Area
as follows:



   (A)   For the annual business license fee set forth in the preceding
table; and



   (B)   For the most recent month for which such price index figure is
available on the date any such license fee is due and annually thereafter.
The adjustment in the annual license fees for any such one-year period shall
be determined as follows:  The price index figure for (a), the price index
figure for (b) and the annual license fee set forth in the table shall be the
basis upon which such adjustment shall be computed. The difference, if any,
between the price index figure for (a) and the price index figure for (b)
shall be ascertained by subtracting the lesser from the greater of such
figures. Thereafter, such differences shall be divided by the price index
figure for (a) which will provide the percentages of change, if any, in the
price index figure. If such percentage of change represents an increase, then
the annual business license fee shall be the annual business license fee set
forth in the table plus the sum derived by multiplying the annual business
license fee by such percentage of change. In no event, however, shall any
annual license fee be less than those amounts set forth in the table.

§ 5.14.010  PURPOSES AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   The practice of fortunetelling, as defined in this chapter,
has historically been subject to abuse by certain unscrupulous practitioners
using the practice to commit fraud and larceny upon clients.



   (B)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate the practice of
fortunetelling in such a manner as to reduce the risk of fraud and larceny to
clients while allowing fortunetellers to provide their services to clients
with only minimal restrictions.



   (C)   The provisions of this chapter requiring a permit, posting of
fees, providing receipts and allowing client recordation of the consultation
will make it more difficult for an unscrupulous fortuneteller to commit fraud
or larceny, and yet, as informational regulations, will not affect the nature
of the information conveyed by the fortuneteller nor the manner in which it
is conveyed. These regulations require only minimal expense and effort on the
part of the fortuneteller and will not, therefore, impose any undue burden on
their practices.



   (D)   Fortunetelling for entertainment purposes, as defined in this
chapter, does not create the same risk of fraud and larceny by an
unscrupulous practitioner as would the practice with an individual client
because it is done with a group at a public place for the purpose of
entertaining and not to deal with the private concerns of an individual.



   (E)   For these and other reasons, the provisions of this chapter
are necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community.



('86 Code, § 5.14.010) (Ord. 4001, passed  - - )



§ 5.14.020  PERMIT REQUIRED.

   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   FORTUNETELLING.  Includes telling of fortunes, forecasting of future
events or furnishing of any information not otherwise obtainable by the

become a hazard to persons or property, or unduly disruptive to neighboring
businesses or residents.

adult business performers in order to promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the city.



   (B)   The intent of the performer licensing provisions are: (1) to
protect minors by requiring that all performers be over the age of 18 years;
(2) to assure the correct identification of persons performing in adult
businesses; (3) to enable the city to deploy law enforcement resources
effectively; and (4) to detect and discourage the involvement of crime in
adult businesses, by precluding the licensing of performers with certain
sex-related convictions within a prescribed time period.



   (C)   It is neither the intent nor the effect of these regulations
to invade the privacy of performers, or to impose limitations or restrictions
on the content of any communicative material. Similarly, it is neither the
intent nor the effect of these regulations to restrict or deny access by
adults to communicative materials or to deny access by the distributors or
exhibitors of adult businesses to their intended, lawful market.



   (D)   Nothing in these regulations is intended to authorize,
legalize or permit the establishment, operation or maintenance of any
business, building or use that violates any city ordinance or any statute of
the State of California regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent
exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness, obscene or harmful matter, or the
exhibition or public display thereof.

policy of insurance shall be cancelled by the company issuing the same or the
authority of such company to do business in the state shall be revoked, the

§ 5.70.010  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   HOTEL.  A facility offering transient lodging accommodations to the
general public and providing additional services; such as, restaurants and
meeting rooms.



   MOTEL.  An establishment which provides transient accommodations and
contains six or more rooms with at least 25% of all rooms having direct
access to the outside without the necessity of passing through the main lobby
of the building.



   OCCUPANCY.  The use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms, or portions thereof, in any hotel or motel
for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.



   OPERATOR.  The person who is the proprietor of the hotel or motel,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession,
licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions
through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the
managing agent shall also be deemed an OPERATOR for the purposes of this
chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal.
Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the
managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.



   RENT.  The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the
occupancy of space in a hotel or motel valued in money, whether to be
received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any
deduction therefrom whatsoever.



   TRANSIENT.  Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to
occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other
agreement for a period of 21 consecutive calendar days or less, counting
portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in
a hotel or motel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 21
days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator
and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy.



('86 Code, § 5.70.010) (Ord. 3917, passed  - - ; Am. Ord. 4040, passed  -
- )



§ 5.70.020  TAX IMPOSED.



   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel or motel, each transient is
subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of 12% of the rent charged by
the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The
transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent
is paid. If the rent is paid in install-ments, a proportionate share of the
tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the
transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel or motel. If, for any
reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel or motel, the
Director of Finance may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the
Director of Finance.

prescribed by and to the Director of Finance.

§ 5.70.040  OPERATOR'S DUTIES.

extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient.
The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent
charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the
operator. No operator of a hotel or motel shall advertise or state in any
manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax, or any part thereof,

the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner
hereinafter provided.

transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting the tax to the Director

shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary
in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further
information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon
cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators
pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city
until payment thereof is made to the Director of Finance.

§ 5.70.080  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY
DIRECTOR OF FINANCE.



   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax, or
any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Director of Finance shall
proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on
which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Director of Finance
shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which
to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any
operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such
report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such
operator the tax, interest and penalties provided by this chapter. In case
such determination is made, the Director of Finance shall give a notice of
the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at
his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the
serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Director
of Finance for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Director of Finance shall
become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such
application is made, the Director of Finance shall give not less than five
days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show
cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such
hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax,
interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the
Director of Finance shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein
of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal
is taken as provided in § 5.70.090.

under this chapter from certain named service users for specified billing
periods.

the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the
tax; or should the service user have changed his address, to his last known
address.



   (E)   If a service user fails to remit the tax to the Director of
Finance within 15 days from the date of the service of the notice upon him,
which shall be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person,
a penalty of 25% of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be

   (B)   Service supplier.  A service supplier may claim a refirnd or

refunded charges shall also be refunded to service users by the service

§ 5.71.152  MAXIMUM ANNUAL TAX FOR COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL PLANTS.



   (A)   (1)   Commencing on January 1, 1989, the total amount of
all utility taxes (hereinafter called “Taxes”) imposed by this chapter
upon any service user for any one commercial or industrial plant location
during any one calendar year shall not exceed the amount of $90,000.



      (2)   Commencing on January 1, 1990, and annually thereafter,
the taxes payable pursuant hereto shall be adjusted in relation to the
Consumer Price Index issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United
States Department of Labor for All Urban Consumers of the Greater Los Angeles
Area as follows:



         (a)   For the taxes set forth in division (A)(1) of this
section; and



         (b)   For the most recent month for which such price
index figure is available on the date any such taxes are due and annually
thereafter.



      (3)   The adjustment in the taxes for any such one-year period
shall be determined as follows:



      (4)   The price index figure for (a), the price index figure
for (b) and the annual license fee set forth in the division (A)(1) of this
section shall be the basis upon which such adjustment shall be computed. The
difference, if any, between the price index figure for (a) and the price
index figure for (b) shall be ascertained by subtracting the lesser from the
greater of such figures. Thereafter, such differences shall be divided by the
price index figure for (a) which will provide the percentages of change, if
any, in the price index figure. If such percentage of change represents an
increase, then the taxes shall be the taxes as set forth in division (A)(1)
of this section plus the sum derived by multiplying the taxes by such
percentage of change. In no event, however, shall any taxes be less than
those amounts set forth in the division (A)(1) of this section.



   (B)   Those service users whose total amount of all utility taxes
imposed by this chapter for any one commercial or industrial plant location
during any one calendar year exceeds $70,000 may pay such annual maximum
amount directly to the Director of Finance in two installments of $35,000
each. Each such installment shall be due and payable to the city on or before
January 1 and July 1 of each calendar year. Upon receipt of each such
installment, the Director of Finance shall notify each service supplier not
to impose the utility users tax required by this chapter for the ensuing
six-month period.



   (C)   Any service user paying more than the maximum tax provided for
in this section during any one calendar year may claim a refund or credit for
such overpayment in the manner provided in § 5.71.150 of this code.



   (D)   The phrase “one commercial or industrial plant location”
as used in this section shall mean one or more contiguous sites for which the
service user receives one or more utility billings.

§ 5.71.154  TAXES; SEPARATE ACCOUNTING; QUARTERLY REPORTS; ANNUAL REVIEW.



   (A)   Utility Users Tax Account.  The Director of Finance shall
establish a “utility users tax account” within the general fund and shall
place therein any and all of the taxes collected under this chapter which are
in excess of the amounts needed to fund the general fund budget during any
one fiscal year.



   (B)   Quarterly reports.  Commencing on December 31, 1983, and
quarterly thereafter, the Director of Finance shall prepare a report to be
furnished to the City Council and the City Manager of the amount of all of
the taxes collected under this chapter and the disposition of same, including
the balance, if any, in the utility users tax account, for the previous
quarter.



   (C)   Annual review. Each year in conjunction with the city's annual
budget deliberations, the City Council shall reconsider the provisions and
rate of the utility users tax as well as any surplus which may have
accumulated in the utility users tax account during the current fiscal year,
after which the City Council may modify the provisions and rate of the tax
and/or may provide no tax on one or more utilities for the ensuing fiscal
year. The tax imposed shall continue to be levied for each fiscal year under
the provisions of this chapter unless modified by the City Council.



   (D)   No tax collected for electrical for certain years.  Pursuant
to division (C) of this section, the City Council has determined that for
fiscal years 1987-88, 1988-89 and 1989-90, there will be no utility users tax
collected for residential properties on electrical energy and water delivered
through mains or pipes. The determination to not impose the tax on
residential electricity and water usage does not impair the City Council's
ability to impose the same in subsequent fiscal years.



   Exception:    Electrical - All residential accounts classified by
the utility as Revenue Rate Code 01. Exemption status will be applicable to
the first full billing period of the utility after the effective date of the
ordinance.



   (E)   No tax collected for gas for certain years.  Pursuant to
division (C) of this section, the City Council has determined that effective
January 1, 1989, for the remainder of 1988-89 fiscal year and for the 1989-90
fiscal year, there will be no utility users tax collected for residential
properties on gas energy delivered through mains or pipes. The deter-mination
to not impose the tax on residential gas usage does not impair the City
Council's ability to impose the same in subsequent fiscal years.

§ 5.71.160  EXEMPTIONS.



   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as imposing a tax
upon the city or any of its depart-ments, agencies, boards or commissions or
upon the City School and High School Districts or upon any other person when
imposition of such tax upon that person would be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of
California.



   (B)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, whenever
a service supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities
Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction makes a refund to service
users of charges for past utility services, the taxes paid pursuant to this
chapter on the amount of such refunded charges shall also be refunded to
service users by the service supplier, and the service supplier shall be
entitled to claim a credit for such refunded taxes against the amount of tax
which is due upon the next monthly return. In the event the ordinance
enacting this chapter is repealed, the amount of any refundable taxes will be
borne by the city; provided, however, the same have been remitted to the city
by the service supplier and have been received by the city.

declaration under perjury and shall contain such information as may be
required by the Director of Finance.



   (E)   Review and certification.  The Director of Finance shall
review each application and shall certify the applicant as exempt if the
eligibility requirements for division (A) are met, except that no exemption
shall be granted to an applicant who is receiving service from a service
supplier through a master meter, or who is sharing or prorating service with
other service users even though such services users qualify under the
provisions of division (A) and no exemption shall be granted with respect to
any tax imposed by this chapter which is or has been paid by a public agency
or where the applicant receives funds from a public agency specifically for
the payment of such tax.



   (F)   Notice to service supplier. If an applicant is certified as
exempt, the Director of Finance shall promptly notify applicant's service

information as may be necessary for the service supplier to remove the exempt
service from its tax billing procedure.

supplier to the service user prior to removing the service user from its tax
billing procedure shall be collected from the service user, and the service

by the service user between the time that the application for exemption is
filed and the service supplier removes the service user from its taxing
procedure will not be refunded to the service user.



   (I)   Duration of exemption.  Exemptions certified by the Director
of Finance shall continue so long as the facts supporting the qualification
for exemption shall exist; provided, however, that the exemption shall
automatically terminate with any change in the service address or residence
of the exempt individual or assignment of a different account number by the
service supplier because of discontinuance or suspension of service at the
request of the service user; and provided further that such individual may
nevertheless apply for a new exemption with each change of address or
residence.



   (J)   Duty to disclose disqualification. 



      (1)   Any service user who has been exempted under this
section shall notify the Director of Finance within ten days of any change in

such exemption does not exist or ceases to exist.



      (2)   Any service supplier, who determines by any means that a
view or nonexempt service user is receiving service through a meter or
connection exempt by virtue of an exemption issued to a previous user or
exempt user of the same meter or connection, shall immediately notify the
Director of Finance of such fact and the Director of Finance shall connect an
investigation to ascertain whether or not the provisions of this section have
been complied with, and where appropriate, order the service supplier to
commence collecting the tax from the nonexempt service user.

ARTICLE I.  NUISANCES ENUMERATED



§ 6.26.010  FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT.



   (A)   Findings. The City Council finds and declares as follows:



      (1)   Section VII of Article XI of the California Constitution
provides that a city may make and enforce within its limits all local,
police, sanitary and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with
general laws.



      (2)   California Government Code Section 38771 provides that
legislative bodies of cities may declare what constitutes a nuisance.



      (3)   California Government Code Section 38772 et seq. further
provides that legislative bodies of cities may provide for the summary
abatement of any nuisance at the expense of the persons creating, causing,
committing, or maintaining it, and by ordinance may make the expense of
abatement of nuisances a lien against the property on which the nuisance is
maintained and a personal obligation against the property owner.



      (4)   Nuisance conditions are offensive or annoying to the
senses, detrimental to property values and community appearance, an
obstruction or interference with the comfortable enjoyment of adjacent
properties or premises (both public and private), and/or are hazardous or
injurious to the health, safety, or welfare of the general public.



   (B)    Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this chapter
are as follows:



      (1)   To define as public nuisances and violations those
conditions and uses of land that are offensive or annoying to the senses,
detrimental to property values and community appearance, an obstruction or
interference with the comfortable enjoyment of adjacent properties or
premises (both public and private), and/or are hazardous or injurious to the
health, safety, or welfare of the general public.



      (2)   To develop regulations that will promote the sound
maintenance of property and enhance conditions of appearance, habitability,
occupancy, use and safety of all structures and premises in the City.



      (3)   To establish administrative procedures for the City’s
use, upon its election, to correct or abate public nuisances on real property
throughout the City.



      (4)   This chapter is not intended to be applied, construed or
given effect in a manner that



imposes upon the City, or upon any officer or employee thereof, any duty
towards persons or property within the City or outside of the City that
creates a basis for civil liability for damages, except as otherwise imposed
by law.

Notice of Abatement. On such occasions, all costs of the abatement,
including, but not limited to, those defined in Municipal Code §
6.26.020(C), shall be assessed against the responsible person(s) and/or the
subject property as a lien or as a special assessment, or as otherwise
allowed by law.

Substandard Property with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office against

in the manner and time set forth in this Notice of Abatement and provided
that a timely appeal therefrom has not been made.



   Please Take Further Notice that, in the event of abatement by City

chapter, any notice required by this chapter may be served by personal
delivery to any responsible person or by first class mail. The date of
service shall be the date it is personally delivered or placed in a U.S.
Postal Service receptacle. Failure of any responsible person to receive a

with this subsection (A), be posted at or upon each exit of the building or

chapter, any notice issued to an owner of real property shall be sent to the

(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.120  RIGHT OF APPEAL FROM A NOTICE OF ABATEMENT.



   (A)   A responsible person may contest a notice of abatement by
filing a written request for an appeal with the Office of the City Clerk,
Alhambra City Hall, 111 South First Street, Alhambra, CA 91801, and paying an
appeal fee in an amount set by Council resolution within 10 calendar days
after service of the notice of abatement and a failure to exhaust all
administrative remedies. The filing of a request for an appeal shall not stay
an order to vacate any building or structure issued in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter by the building official and/or fire chief, and/or
health official.



   (B)   A written request for an appeal shall contain the following

payment of the appeal fee constitutes a waiver of the right to contest a
notice of abatement. In this event, the notice of abatement is final and
binding.



   (D)   The provisions of this section only apply to instances where
the City has elected to establish the right, but not the obligation, to abate
public nuisances with City personnel. In no event does this chapter limit the
right of City officials to issue alternative written or oral notices of code
violations to responsible persons or to cause the abatement of public
nuisances in a different manner, including, without limitation, by court
orders arising from the City’s exercise of its criminal or civil remedies.
In such instances, a responsible person shall receive a right to hearing and
other due process rights through the court process.



(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.130  CONSEQUENCE OF AN UNTIMELY APPEAL.



   (A)   If a timely appeal and/or payment of the appeal fee is not
received by the City Clerk, the right to appeal is waived and the notice of
abatement is final and binding. In such instances, the City may, without any
administrative hearing, cause the abatement with City personnel of any or all
of the nuisance conditions or activities stated in the notice of abatement.
The City shall follow the procedures stated in this chapter for recovery of
all abatement costs, fees and expenses (incidental or otherwise).



   (B)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall obligate the City to
undertake abatement actions pursuant to a notice of abatement, whether or not
there is a timely appeal.



(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.140  ABATEMENT BY RESPONSIBLE PERSON PRIOR TO HEARING.



   (A)   Any responsible person shall have the right to abate a
nuisance in accordance with the notice of abatement at his or her own
expense, provided all corrective actions are completed with all required City
permits, approvals and inspections, prior to the date the matter is set for a
hearing.



   (B)   A hearing shall be cancelled if all nuisance conditions or
activities are, as determined by the City, fully and lawfully abated prior
thereto.



(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.150  REVIEW BY HEARING OFFICER.



   (A)   Any responsible person who contests a notice of abatement
shall, subject to filing a timely appeal, obtain review thereof before a
hearing officer. The administrative appeal shall be scheduled no later than
60 calendar days, and no sooner than 10 calendar days, after receipt of a
timely filed request for appeal. The appellants listed on the written request
for an appeal shall be notified in writing of the date, time, and location of
the hearing at least 10 calendar days prior to the date of the hearing.



   (B)   Any request by an appellant to continue a hearing must be
submitted to the City Clerk in writing no later than two business days before
the date scheduled for the hearing. The hearing officer may continue a
hearing for good cause or on his/her own motion; however, in no event may the
hearing be continued for more than 30 calendar days without stipulation by
all parties.



   (C)   At the place and time set forth in the notification of appeal
hearing, the hearing officer shall hear and consider the testimony of the
appealing person(s), the issuing officer, and/or their witnesses, as well as
any documentary evidence presented by these persons concerning the alleged
public nuisance(s).



   (D)   Appeal hearings are informal, and formal rules of evidence and
discovery do not apply. The City bears the burden of proof to establish a
nuisance exists by a preponderance of evidence. The issuance of a notice of
abatement shall constitute prima facie evidence of the violation. The
appellant, and the enforcement officer issuing the notice, if present, as
well as all other responsible persons, shall have the opportunity to present
evidence and to present and cross examine witnesses. The appellant and the
enforcement officer issuing the notice of abatement, or other responsible
persons, may represent himself/ herself/themselves or be represented by
anyone of his/her/their choice. The appellant, or other interested persons,
may bring an interpreter to the hearing at his/ her/their sole expense. The
City may, at its discretion, record the hearing by stenographer or court
reporter, audio recording, or video recording. The hearing officer may
question any person who presents evidence or who testifies at any hearing.



   (E)   The appellant, or other interested persons, may appear at the
hearing in person or by written declaration executed under penalty of
perjury. Said declaration and any documents in support thereof shall be
tendered to and received by the office of the City Clerk at least three City
business days prior to the hearing. If all appellants and interested persons
elect to appear at the hearing by written declaration, the enforcement
officer who issued the notice of abatement shall not be required to attend or
participate at the hearing.



   (F)   If the appellant fails, or other responsible persons fail, to
appear, or to otherwise submit a written declaration or any admissible
evidence demonstrating the nonexistence of the alleged nuisance(s), the
hearing officer shall cancel the hearing and send a notice thereof to the
responsible person(s) by first class mail to the address(es) stated on the
appeal form. A cancellation of a hearing due to nonappearance of the
appellant shall constitute the appellant’s waiver of the right to appeal.
In such instances, the notice of abatement is final and binding.



(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.160  DECISION OF HEARING OFFICER - ORDER OF ABATEMENT.



   (A)   Not later than 15 calendar days following conclusion of the
hearing, the hearing officer shall determine if any nuisance condition exists
at the subject property. If the hearing officer determines that each nuisance
condition described in the notice of abatement is nonexistent, the notice of
abatement shall be deemed cancelled. If the hearing officer determines that
one or more of the nuisance conditions described in the notice of abatement
exists, he/she shall issue a written order of abatement which shall contain
the following:



      (1)   A finding and description of each nuisance condition
existing at the subject property.



      (2)   The name of each person responsible for a nuisance
condition or conditions at the subject property, as well as the name of any
person who is not responsible therefor.



      (3)   The required corrective action and a compliance period
for each unabated nuisance condition.



      (4)   Any other finding, determination or requirement that is
relevant or related to the subject matter of the appeal.



      (5)   The following statement:



   The decision of the Hearing Officer is final, conclusive and binding.
Judicial review of this decision is subject to the provisions and time limits
set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.6 et seq.



   (B)   Notwithstanding any provision of this Code to the contrary,
the decision of the hearing officer is final and conclusive.



   (C)   A copy of the decision shall be served by first class mail on
each responsible person to whom the notice of abatement was issued. If the
owner is not an appellant, a copy of the order of abatement shall also be
served on the owner by first class mail to the address shown on the last
equalized assessment roll. Failure of a person to receive a properly
addressed decision shall not invalidate any action or proceeding by the City
pursuant to this chapter.



(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.170  ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE BY RESPONSIBLE PERSONS PRIOR TO CITY
ABATEMENT ACTIONS.



   (A)   Any responsible person shall have the right to fully abate a
nuisance in accordance with the hearing officer’s decision prior to the
date of entry of City personnel upon the subject real property, provided that
all corrective actions are completed with all required City permits,
approvals and inspections, prior to said entry date. In such instances, all
administrative proceedings shall be cancelled, with the exception of the
City’s right to seek recovery of its incurred incidental expenses, code
enforcement fees, and attorney’s fees as provided by and pursuant to the
provisions of Municipal Code Chapters 1.12 and 6.27.



   (B)   Once the City enters a subject real property to abate a public
nuisance, it shall have the right to complete this action.



   (C)   It is unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person to obstruct,
impede, or interfere with City personnel in the performance of any act that
is carried out to abate a public nuisance.



   (D)   All buildings, structures, and/or personal property that are
removed by City personnel from premises in the abatement of a nuisance shall
be lawfully disposed of or destroyed without regard to its actual or salvage
value, if any.



(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.180  EMERGENCY ACTION TO ABATE AN IMMINENT HAZARD.



   (A)   Notwithstanding any provision of the Alhambra Municipal Code
to the contrary, the city manager, police chief, fire chief, director of code
enforcement, health official, or building official, or any of their
designees, may cause a public nuisance to be summarily abated if it is
determined that the nuisance creates an imminent hazard to a person or
persons, or to other real or personal property.



   (B)   Prior to abating a nuisance that creates an imminent hazard,
the City Manager shall attempt to notify a responsible person by telephone or
in writing of the imminent hazard and request its abatement by said person;
provided, however, that the City Manager may dispense with any attempt at
prior notification of a responsible person if, in the sole discretion of the
City Manager, the nature or severity of the hazard does not reasonably allow
for such prior notification. If notice has been so given, but, in the sole
discretion of the City Manager, the responsible person(s) fail(s) to take
immediate and meaningful steps to abate the imminent hazard, the City may
abate the nuisance with City personnel without further notice, and charge the
costs and fees thereof to the responsible person(s).



   (C)   Within 10 business days following emergency action of City
personnel to abate an imminent hazard, the City shall serve any responsible
person with a notice of emergency abatement by City personnel of an imminent
hazard by first class mail. Notice to a property owner shall be mailed to the
mailing address set forth in the last equalized assessment roll of the Los
Angeles County Assessor’s Office. Failure of any responsible person to
receive a properly addressed notice of emergency abatement by City personnel
of an imminent hazard by mail shall not invalidate any action or proceeding
pursuant to this chapter.



   (D)   A notice of emergency abatement by City personnel of an
imminent hazard shall contain the following provisions:



      (1)   The name of all known responsible persons who are being
served with the notice of emergency abatement by City personnel of an
imminent hazard and the address of the real property on which the imminent
hazard was present.



      (2)   A brief description of the condition(s) and reasons why
it constituted an imminent hazard.



      (3)   A brief description of the law prohibiting or pertaining
to the imminent hazard.



      (4)   A brief description of the actions City personnel took
to abate the imminent hazard.



   (E)   Omission of any of the foregoing provisions in a notice of
emergency abatement by City personnel of an imminent hazard, whether in whole
or in part, or the failure of a responsible person to receive said notice, or
the failure of the City to issue said notice in a timely fashion, shall not
render it defective or render any proceeding or action pursuant to this
chapter invalid.



   (F)   Emergency abatement of an imminent hazard by City personnel
shall not preclude the City from recording a declaration of substandard
property in accordance with the provisions of Municipal Code § 6.26.250, if
conditions thereafter remain at the premises that constitute a violation of
law or a public nuisance.



   (G)   The City shall be entitled to recover its fees and costs
(incidental or otherwise) for the abatement of an imminent hazard. In such
instances, the City shall follow the procedures set forth in this chapter.



(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.190  COMBINATION OF NOTICES.



   The notices that are authorized by this chapter may be combined in the
discretion of the City.



(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.200  ESTABLISHMENT OF COSTS OF ABATEMENT.



   (A)   The City shall keep an accounting of the abatement costs.



   (B)   The City shall serve a statement of abatement costs on the
responsible persons within 90 calendar days after the City’s completion of
nuisance abatement actions. Service of this statement may be made in the
manner provided for in Municipal Code 6.26.110.



   (C)   Unless a timely contest of the statement of abatement costs is
filed, a responsible person shall tender the abatement costs in U.S. currency
to the City within 30 calendar days after the date of service of the
statement of abatement costs.



   (D)   A responsible person has the right to contest a statement of
abatement costs by filing a written request for contest with the Office of
the City Clerk, Alhambra City Hall, 111 South First Street, Alhambra, CA
91801, within 10 calendar days after service of the statement of abatement
costs.



      (1)   A written request for contest shall contain the

         (a)    Name, address, telephone number, and signature of

         (b)   Address and description of the real property upon

      (2)   No fee shall be due for the filing of a request for
contest of the statement of abatement costs.



   (E)   Failure of the City Clerk to receive a timely appeal request
for contest constitutes a waiver of the right to contest a statement of
abatement costs. In this event, the statement of abatement costs is final and
binding, and the City may proceed to collect its abatement costs as contained
in a final statement of abatement costs in any manner allowed by law.



   (F)   If a timely request for contest is received by the City Clerk,
a hearing shall be set before the hearing officer no later than 60 calendar
days, and no sooner than 10 calendar days, after receipt of the request for
contest. A notice of the date, time and location of the hearing shall be
served on all responsible persons who contested the statement of abatement
costs by first class mail to the address(es) stated on the request form at
least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing. Failure of a person requesting a
contest to receive a properly addressed notice shall not invalidate any
action or proceeding by the City pursuant to this chapter.



   (G)   Any request by an appellant to continue a hearing must be
submitted to the City Clerk in writing no later than five business days
before the date scheduled for the hearing. The hearing officer may continue a
hearing for good cause or on his or her own motion; however, in no event may
the hearing be continued for more than 60 calendar days without stipulation
by all parties.



   (H)   At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the
request to contest the statement of abatement costs, the hearing officer
shall hear and pass upon the evidence submitted by City personnel, together
with any objections or protests raised by responsible persons liable for said
costs. Testimony and evidence shall be limited to issues related to the
abatement costs, and no person shall be permitted to present evidence or
testimony challenging the existence of a public nuisance or the manner of
abatement as described in the notice of abatement. Thereupon, the hearing
officer may make such revision, connection or modification to the statement
as he or she may deem just, after which the statement, as it is submitted, or
as revised, corrected or modified, shall be confirmed. The hearing may be
continued from time to time.



   (I)    Notwithstanding any provisions of this code to the contrary,
the decision of the hearing officer is final and binding.



   (J)   The City Clerk shall cause a confirmed statement of abatement
costs to be served upon all persons who contested the original statement by
first class mail to the address(es) stated on the request form. The City
Clerk shall cause a confirmed statement of abatement costs to be served on
the owner of the property on which City personnel abated a public nuisance by
first class mail to the address shown on the last equalized assessment roll
(irrespective of whether the owner contested the statement of abatement
costs). This document shall also contain the following statement:



   The determination of the City Manager or designee is final and binding.
Judicial review of this decision is subject to the provisions and time limits
set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.6 et seq.



   (K)   Failure of a person to receive a properly addressed confirmed
statement shall not invalidate any action or proceeding by the City pursuant
to this chapter.



   (L)   A responsible person shall tender the abatement costs in U.S.
currency to the City within 30 calendar days after the date of service of the
confirmed statement of abatement costs. The City may thereafter proceed to
collect its abatement costs as contained in the confirmed statement of
abatement costs in any manner allowed by law.



(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.210  COLLECTION OF ABATEMENT COSTS BY SPECIAL ASSESSMENT.



   (A)    The City may cause a special assessment to be made upon real
property upon which a public nuisance was abated pursuant to Government Code
Section 38773.5, and future amendments thereto, in the event a statement of
abatement costs or a confirmed statement of abatement costs is not paid in a
timely manner.



   (B)   A notice of special assessment shall be sent to the owner(s)
of the subject real property by certified mail at the time the assessment is
imposed which shall contain the following recitals:



      The property may be sold after three years by the tax collector
for unpaid delinquent assessments. The tax collector’s power of sale shall
not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. The
assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same
penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided
for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and
enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment.
However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been
transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a
bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior
to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become
delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the
real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for
collection.



   (C)   The city attorney or city prosecutor shall establish the
notice of special assessment form for use, or consideration by, the tax
collector in collecting a special assessment.



   (D)   The notice of special assessment shall be entitled to
recordation with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office.



   (E)   The amount of a special assessment shall also constitute a
personal obligation of the property owners of land upon which the nuisance
was abated.



(Ord. 4667, passed 2-9-15)



§ 6.26.220  COLLECTION OF COSTS OF ABATEMENT BY NUISANCE ABATEMENT LIEN.



   (A)   As an alternative to the procedure contained in Municipal Code
§ 6.26.210, the City may cause a nuisance abatement lien to be recorded upon
real property upon which a public nuisance was abated pursuant to Government
Code Section 38773.1, and future amendments thereto, in the event a statement
of abatement costs or a confirmed statement of abatement costs is not paid in
a timely manner.



   (B)   A lien shall not be recorded prior to serving the owner of
record of the parcel of land on which the public nuisance is maintained with
a notice. This document shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a
civil action in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10) of
Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the owner
of record, after diligent search, cannot be found, the notice may be served
by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a
period of 10 days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation published in Los Angeles County pursuant to Section 6062 of the
Government Code.



   (C)   The nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded in the Los
Angeles County Recorder’s Office in the county in which the parcel of land
is located and from the date of recording shall have the force, effect, and
priority of a judgment lien.



   (D)   A nuisance abatement lien authorized by this section shall
specify the amount of the lien for the City of Alhambra, the name of the City
department or division on whose behalf the lien is imposed, the date of the
abatement actions, the street address, legal description and assessor’s
parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and
address of the recorded owner of the parcel.



   (E)   In the event that the lien is discharged, released, or
satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge
containing the information specified in subsection (D) of this section shall
be recorded by the City. A nuisance abatement lien and the release of the
lien shall be indexed in the grantor-grantee index.

   The City Council hereby finds that the Police and Fire Departments must
respond to calls for service especially those calls received via the 911
emergency telephone system. Periodically, these calls are false or misleading
and because they require emergency response of public safety personnel, the
personnel are unavailable for legitimate calls which places the residents of
the city at risk. Therefore, the Council hereby further finds that it is in
the best interest of the public safety, welfare, and convenience of the city
as well as in fairness to its citizens to require those persons placing the
false, misleading or annoying telephone calls and/or reports to partially
defray the city's expense for providing the response to the same.

and/or Fire Department response and investigative time. These costs shall
include all costs incurred by the Police Department and/or Fire Department to
respond and investigate the nature of the call, statement or report, and such
costs may include damage to city property and/or injury to city personnel.
Any fee so charged pursuant to this chapter shall not be in excess of $1,000
for a single incident. The city reserves the right to elect any other legal
remedies available to it when the costs or damages exceed $1,000. The
accounting and billing procedures set forth in § 9.20.060 of this chapter

activity as reported pursuant to §§ 9.20.040 and 9.20.060 of this chapter.

   Any and all personnel who may be deployed by the city pursuant to this
chapter shall be deemed to be on regular duty under the general supervision
of the Police Chief or the Fire Chief and any officer in charge under their
respective commands, and shall be entitled to any and all benefits provided
by law or ordinance for such personnel as employees of the city. The pay for
each employee thus employed during such employment shall be at his or her
actual rate of pay with a four-hour minimum. The Police Chief, Fire Chief, or
other department head, as the case may be, shall report to the Director of
Finance the name of the person, firm, organization or corporation requiring

person, firm or corporation employing such personnel for the amount paid to
each plus the cost of worker's compensation charges and other administrative

such personnel to make payment therefore shall constitute a debt due solely

by the district attorney, administrative proceedings brought by a local
government or agency, or a civil or criminal action maintained by the
Alhambra City Attorney or prosecution attorney.



   (E)   Decision and appealing the denial of Alhambra massage
establishment registry and Alhambra massage establishment registry renewals.



      (1)   Upon determining that grounds for denial exist, the
Community Development Director shall furnish written notice of the denial to
the applicant. The notice shall summarize the principal reasons for the
denial, shall state that the applicant may request an appeal hearing within
15 days of the postmarked date on the notice, and shall be delivered by mail
to the applicant as that name and address appear on the application. Within
15 days after the mailing of the notice, the applicant may file a request for
an appeal hearing with the City Clerk. An application for an appeal must
include a general statement specifying the basis for the appeal and the
specific aspect of the decision being appealed. An appeal must be accompanied
by supporting evidence substantiating the basis for the appeal. The scope of
the appeal hearing pursuant to this section shall be limited to those issues
raised by the appellant in the written appeal statement.



      (2)   Upon receipt of a timely filed appeal and payment of the
appropriate fee, the City Clerk shall set the matter for hearing before the
hearing officer. The hearing shall be held not fewer than ten days nor more
than 60 days from the date of the appeal request. The hearing may be
continued upon the mutual consent of the parties.



      (3)   The appellant shall be provided with notice of the time
and place of the appeal hearing, as well as a copy of all relevant materials
at least seven days prior to the hearing.

review the records and files relating to the decision.



      (5)   The hearing officer shall permit any interested person
to present any relevant evidence bearing on the issues involved in the matter.



      (6)   In conducting the hearing, technical rules relating to
evidence and witnesses shall not apply. Any relevant evidence may be admitted
if it is material and if it is evidence customarily relied upon by
responsible persons in the conduct of their affairs regardless of the
existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make admission of
the evidence improper over objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may
be admissible if it is the sort upon which reasonable persons are accustomed
to rely in the conduct of serious affairs. The rules of privilege shall be
applicable to the extent they are permitted in civil actions.



      (7)   The appellant shall have the burden of proving that he
or she meets the requirements for issuing the registry in the first instance;
the city shall have the burden in proving that grounds exist for revoking,
suspending, conditioning or failing to renew a registry.



      (8)   Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the
hearing officer shall determine whether the Director’s decision should be
affirmed, modified or reversed. The hearing officer’s decision is final.



      (9)   The hearing officer’s decision shall be communicated
in writing to the appellant within seven days after the close of the hearing
and submission of the matter to the hearing officer for decision.



      (10)   The decision of the hearing officer shall include
notice that the decision is final and is subject to judicial review pursuant
to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1094.5, and that any action filed in the superior
court shall be filed within the time period provided by law.



   (F)   Facilities prerequisite to Alhambra massage establishment
registry issuance. An Alhambra massage establishment registry shall not be
issued pursuant to this chapter unless an inspection by city personnel
reveals that the establishment complies with each of the following minimum

Director if the services provided or site plan do not necessitate some or all
of these facilities.

lines and cause short circuiting, power outages, fire, explosions, and power
lines falling to the ground. These interruptions of power disrupt and
endanger the lives of the residents of the city. Therefore the use of
metallic balloons is discouraged, especially when large quantities are used
for advertising or other commercial use.

   (A)   The sign or notice shall read substantially as follows:



   WARNING, METALLIC BALLOONS ARE CONDUCTORS OF ELECTRICITY. DO NOT USE
NEAR ANY SOURCE OF ELECTRIC POWER. DO NOT RELEASE OUTDOORS. CONTACT WITH
TRANSMISSION LINES CAN CAUSE SHORT CIRCUITING, POWER OUTAGES AND FIRE.



   (B)   In no event shall the sign or notice be smaller than eight
inches wide and eight inches long, nor shall any lettering thereon be less
than one-inch in height.



   (C)   At least one sign or notice shall be placed so as to assure
that it can be read from all counter locations available to the public.



   (D)   In the event a substantial number of the public patronizing
the premises offering for sale or dispensing for consideration, metallic
balloons, uses a language other than English as a primary language, the sign
or notice shall be worded in both English and the primary language or
languages involved.

obtaining a warrant as required by law.



   (B)   If the city removes or paints over graffiti on property
pursuant to an order of abatement, the city may charge the property owner
applicable labor and material costs for the removal of graffiti. The City
Director of Public Works or his/her designee shall keep an account of costs
(including, but not limited to, the actual expenses for the preparation of
notices, specifications and contracts, inspecting the work, and the costs of
printing and mailing) of abating such graffiti on each separate parcel of
land where the work is done. At the time and place fixed for receiving and
considering the report, the City Council shall hear and pass upon the
accounting of costs of abatement, together with any objections or protests.
The City Council shall make any revision, correction or modification in the
cost report as it may deem appropriate, after which the City Council, by
motion, shall confirm the original or modified cost report. The decision of
the City Council on all protests and objections which may be made shall be
final and conclusive. The total cost for abating such nuisance, as confirmed
by the City Council, shall constitute a special assessment against the
respective lot or parcel of land to which it relates, and upon recordation in
the office of the Los Angeles County Recorder of a notice of lien, shall
constitute a lien on the property for the amount of such assessment. After
such recordation, such lien may be foreclosed by judicial or other sale in
the manner and means provided by law.

used in this chapter are defined as follows:



   ALARM AGENT.  Any person who owns or operates or is employed by an

structure or facility.



   ALARM SYSTEM.  Any mechanical or electrical device or combination
thereof which is designed for the detection of unauthorized entry on or into
any building, place or premises or for alerting others of the commission of
an unlawful act, or both, and which when actuated emits a sound or transmits
a signal or message. ALARM SYSTEMS include, but are not limited to, direct
dial telephone devices, audible alarms and proprietor alarms. Devices which
are not designed or used to register alarms that are audible, visible or
perceptible outside of the protected building, structure or facility are not
included within this definition, nor are auxiliary devices installed by the
telephone company to protect telephone company systems which might be damaged
or destroyed by the use of an alarm system.

entry on premises which generates an audible sound on the premises when it is
activated.

situation for which the alarm system was designed or used does not exist due
to mechanical failure, accidental tripping or actuation (human error),
misoperation, malfunction, misuse or the neglect of the owner or lessee of an
alarm system, or of his employees or agents. Upon failure of the Police or
Fire Department to find any evidence of intrusion, fire or attempted
intrusion, or other need or cause for activating an alarm system, a

§ 9.94.010   PURPOSE; POLICY; AUTHORITY; APPLICATION.



   The City Council finds that the commercial exploitation of explicit
sexual conduct through the public exhibition of lewd films, and the sale of
obscene publications, constitutes a debasement and distortion of a sensitive
key relationship of human existence, central to family life, community
welfare and the development of human personality; that such exploitation is
indecent and offensive to the senses and to public morals and interferes with
the interest of the public in the quality of life and debases total community
environment, the commerce in the city, property values, and the public
safety; and that the continuation of such activities is detrimental to the
public peace, health, safety, good morals and general welfare of the city,
and of the residents, citizens, inhabitants and business thereof. Pursuant to
Cal. Gov't Code §§ 38771, 38773 and 38773.5, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 731,
and Cal. Civ. Code §§ 3479, 3480, 3491 and 3494, the Council hereby
declares such activities to be public nuisances, and herein establishes
procedures for abatement thereof. This chapter shall apply to existing
establishments which are presently engaged in the activities herein declared
to be public nuisances as well as those which may be commenced in the future.

   The City Council does find that there exists and has existed an
increasing trend toward the display of adult reading material at grocery
stores, convenience stores, drugstores, and other retail outlets within the
city. The adult reading material is often displayed within the open view of
children of tender years and is easily accessible to them. The City Council
finds that this material is adverse to the public peace, morals and good
order of young children. The Council further finds that it is in the best
interest of the public safety, welfare and convenience of the city to
restrict the display of adult reading material and to adopt the following
regulations so that adverse impacts upon young children are kept to a minimum.

(Ord. 4458, passed 2-23-04)



§ 9.98.030  PUBLIC LODGING FACILITY REGISTERS REQUIRED.



   (A)   Every owner, keeper or proprietor of any hotel or motel in the
city shall keep a register on forms approved by or supplied by the city
wherein he shall require all guests to inscribe the names and home or
business addresses of all persons to be accommodated, with the length of stay
indicated.  At the time of registration, the operator or his or her employee
shall verify the identification of the registrant by requesting to see, and
copying onto the registration form any of the following: the registrant's
valid driver's license, the registrant's valid military identification, the
registrant's valid passport number and country of issuance, a valid credit
card with photo identification issued in the registrant's name.  The
register shall also show the time and date when the name was inscribed and
the room occupied or to be occupied by the guest(s) in such public lodging
facility.  The operator or his or her employee must also include on the
registration form the daily rate charged and amount collected as and for
rental of the room, the make, type and license number of the registrant's
automobile, trailer or other vehicle, and the state in which such vehicle is
registered and the year of registration, for any vehicle that is parked on
the premises. The operator or his or her employee shall at the time of the
departure of each guest, endorse upon such register the date of such
departure. All such registers shall be maintained for a period of three years
from and after the date of the last entry therein.

such register.

motel utilizes a pre-arrival registration or approval procedure that obviates
the requirement for an arriving guest to go to the front desk and provide
information typically required as part of the hotel's or motel's customary
registration process, the hotel or motel shall not be required to comply with
division  (A) of this section; provided, however, that the hotel's

City Manager might reasonably require.



   (D)   Illegal registration; false names.   No person shall register
at any hotel in the city, under the name of any other person, or by any
assumed, false or fictitious name or sublet a room to another person.  No
person placing any information required by this section shall falsely or
inaccurately state such information.  It shall be a rebuttable presumption
that any adult found inside a room who is not named on the hotel/motel
registration has obtained lodging without the permission of the hotel owner
or its agent in violation of Cal. Penal Code § 647(j).  It is likewise
unlawful for any person who has registered at any rooming house, lodging
house, hotel, inn or other place in the city to allow unregistered guests to
occupy the guest room unless the registered guest notifies the hotel owner or
its agent that the visitor will be occupying the room.



   (E)   Bank accounts.  The operator shall maintain in a banking
institution one or more accounts ("accounts") which shall be used exclusively
for the deposit of rentals and expenditures relating to the hotel or motel.
All receipts related to rentals and expenditures from the hotel or motel
shall be deposited in such accounts.  Bank statements, deposit slips,
cancelled checks and other withdrawal forms shall be maintained on file by
the hotel or motel operator and shall be made available upon request to the
city Director of Finance, Police Department, district attorney's office or
the City Attorney.

   The City Council hereby finds that there exists and has existed an
increasing trend toward large parties and gatherings both at rental
facilities and private homes within the city. The parties, on many occasions,
disturb the public peace, safety, and welfare thereby requiring police
services over and above those normally provided. Therefore, the Council
hereby further finds that it is in the best interest of the public safety,
welfare, and convenience of the city as well as in fairness to its citizens
to require those persons utilizing the additional police services to
partially defray the city's expense for providing the same.

§ 9.99.020  SECOND RESPONSE; FEE.



   When a large party or gathering occurs at a premises and a police
officer at the scene determines that there is a threat to the public peace,
health, safety or general welfare, the person in charge of the premises and
the person responsible for the event, or if either of those persons is a
minor, then the parents or guardians of that minor, will be held jointly and
severally liable for the cost of providing police personnel on special
security assignment over and above the services normally provided by the
department. The police personnel utilized during a second response after the
first warning, to control the threat to the public peace, health, safety or
general welfare, shall be deemed to be on special security assignment over
and above the services normally provided. The costs of such special security
assignment may include minor damages to city property and/or injuries to city
personnel. Any fee so charged pursuant to this chapter shall not be in excess
of $1,000 for a single incident. The city reserves the right to elect any
other legal remedies available to it when the costs or damages exceed $1,000.
The accounting and billing procedures set forth in § 9.99.030 of this
chapter shall apply.

solely to the city.

('86 Code, § 11.18.010) (Ord. 3999, passed  - - )



§ 11.18.020  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to establish pro-cedures for terminal
designation and truck route designation to terminals for interstate trucks
operating on a federally designated highway system and to promote the general
health, safety and welfare of the public.



('86 Code, § 11.18.020) (Ord. 3999, passed  - - )



§ 11.18.030  APPLICATION.



   (A)   Any interested person requiring terminal access for interstate
trucks from the federally designated highway system shall submit an
applica-tion, on a form as provided by the city, together with such
information as may be required by the Director of Public Services and
appropriate fees to the city.



   (B)   Upon receipt of the application, the Director of Public
Services will cause an investigation to be made to ascertain whether or not
the proposed ter-minal facility meets the requirements for an interstate
truck terminal. Upon his approval of that designation, he will then determine
the capability of the route requested and alternate routes, whether requested
or not. Determination of route capability will include, without limitation, a
review of adequate turning radius and lane widths of ramps, intersections and
highways and general traffic conditions, such as sight distance, speed and
traffic volumes. No access off a federally designated highway system will be
approved without the approval of Caltrans.



   (C)   Should the requested route pass through the city to a terminal
located in another jurisdiction, the applicant shall comply with that
jurisdiction's application process as well. Coordination of the approval of
the route through the city will be the responsibility of the entity which
controls the terminal's land use. Costs for trailblazer signs shall be as
provided in § 11.18.040 of this code.



('86 Code, § 11.18.030) (Ord. 3999, passed  - - )



§ 11.18.040  FEES AND COSTS.



   (A)   The applicant shall pay a nonrefundable application fee, as
established by the City Council by resolution, sufficient to pay the cost of
the review of the terminal designation and the review of the route and
alternate route. The Council shall also set, by resolution, an appeal fee to
pay the costs of providing an appeal pursuant to § 11.18.070 of this code.



   (B)   Upon the approval of the terminal designa-tion and route by
the city and by Caltrans, the applicant shall deposit with the city
sufficient funds as established by the Director of Public Services to pay for
the purchase and installation of terminal trailblazer signs. Trailblazer
signs will be required at every decision point in the city on route to the
terminal. Upon completion of the installation of the signs, the actual cost
shall be computed and any difference between the actual and estimated cost
shall be billed or refunded to the applicant, whichever the case may be. No
terminal or route may be used until such signs as may be required are in
place. Costs for trailblazer signs may be apportioned in accordance with the
procedures in § 11.08.050.



('86 Code, § 11.18.040) (Ord. 3999, passed  - - )



§ 11.18.050  RETROFITTING.



   (A)   If all feasible routes to a requested terminal are found
unsatisfactory by the Director of Public Services, the applicant may request
retrofitting the deficiencies. All costs of engineering, construction and
inspection will be the responsibility of the applicant. Except when the
retrofitting of deficiencies is within the jurisdiction of Caltrans, the
actual construction will be done by the city or by a contractor acceptable to
it.



   (B)   When the work is to be done by the city, the applicant shall
deposit with the city the estimated cost of retrofitting. Adjustments between
the estimated and actual cost shall be made after completion of the work and
difference between the actual cost and the estimated cost shall be billed or
refunded to the applicant as the case may be.



   (C)   If at any time within five years from the date of completion
of the retrofitting by the applicant, should any applicant seek terminal
approval which would use the route upon which such retrofitting was
accomplished, any such applicant's fee may include that applicant's
proportionate share of the retrofitting, as determined by the Director of
Public Services, which fee shall be disbursed by the city to the applicant
who paid for the retrofitting, as well as to any applicant who contributed to
the cost of retro-fitting under this section.



('86 Code, § 11.18.050) (Ord. 3999, passed  - - )



§ 11.18.060  REVOCATION OF ROUTE.



   The Director of Public Services may revoke any approved terminal or
route if the terminal or route becomes a traffic hazard for vehicular
traffic. A safety hazard includes the inability of interstate trucks to
negotiate the route or the vehicles causing unsafe driving conditions for
other vehicular traffic or pedestrians.



(Ord. 3999, passed  - - )



§ 11.18.070  APPEAL PROCESS.



   (A)   If the Director of Public Services denies terminal
designation, route feasibility or revokes a previously approved terminal or
route, he shall notify the applicant in writing. The applicant or terminal
owner, within ten days following the date of receipt of the decision of the
Director of Public Services, may appeal the decision to the City Council in
writing. An appeal shall be made on a form pre-scribed by the Director of
Public Services and shall be filed with the City Clerk upon payment of the
appeal fee. The appeal shall state specifically wherein there was an error or
abuse of discretion by the Director of Public Services or wherein its
decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. Within five days of
the filing of an appeal, the Director of Public Services shall transmit to
the City Clerk the terminal application, the sketches of the revoked route
and all other data filed therewith, the report of the Director of Public
Services, the findings of the Director of Public Services and his decision on
the application.



   (B)   The City Clerk shall make copies of the data provided by the
Director of Public Services available to the applicant and to the appellant
(if the applicant is not the appellant) for inspection and may give notice to
any other interested party who requested notice of the time when the appeal
will be considered by the City Council. The appeal shall be scheduled for
Council consideration at a Council meeting not later than 21 days following
receipt of the appeal. The Council may continue consideration of the appeal
for good cause.



   (C)   If Caltrans, and not the Director of Public Services, denies
or revokes terminal access from federally designated highways, no appeal may
be made to the City Council, but must be made to Caltrans as may be permitted
by Caltrans.

§ 11.29.010  PREFERRED PARKING ON RESIDENTIAL STREETS.



   (A)   Establishment of preferred parking districts.  The City
Council may designate by resolution after findings have been made as
hereinafter set forth certain residential streets or street, or any portion
thereof, as a "preferred parking district" as defined in § 11.04.132 of this
code for the benefit of residents adjacent thereto in which district vehicles
displaying a permit or other authorized indicia may be exempt from parking
prohibitions or restrictions otherwise posted, marked, or noticed.



   (B)   Findings.  Each preferred parking district shall be so
designated only upon finding of the City Council that such district is
required to enhance or protect the quality of life in the area of the
proposed district threatened by noise, traffic hazards, environmental
pollution, or devaluation of real property resulting from commuter or
nonresidentially oriented vehicular traffic, and that such district is
necessary to provide reasonably available and convenient parking for the
benefit of the adjacent residents.



   (C)   Criteria for determination of findings.  Such findings shall
be based upon the following criteria:



      (1)   Commuter, nonresidentially oriented, or transient
vehicles do or may substantially and regularly interfere with the use of the
majority of available public streets or alley parking spaces by adjacent
residents; as used herein; "commuter vehicle(s)," "nonresidentially oriented
vehicle(s)" and/or "transient vehicle(s)" shall mean those vehicles operated
by persons whose destinations are to nonresidential areas or establishments
and shall hereinafter collectively and singularly be referred to as the
"vehicles;"



      (2)   The interference by such vehicles at regular and
significant daily or weekly intervals;



      (3)   Said vehicles being driven or parked in the area of the
proposed district cause or are the source of unreasonable noise, traffic
hazards, environmental pollution, or devaluation of real property in the area
of the proposed district;



      (4)   The majority of the residents adjacent to the proposed
district desire, agree to accept, or request preferred parking privileges;



      (5)   No unreasonable displacement of such vehicles will
likely result into residential areas surrounding the preferred parking
district;



      (6)   A shortage of reasonably available and convenient
residential related parking spaces exists in the area of the proposed
district; and



      (7)   No alternative solution is feasible or practical.



(Ord. 4318, passed 12-16-96)



§ 11.29.012  PREFERRED PARKING ON CERTAIN STREETS WITHIN COMMERCIAL AREAS.



   (A)   Establishment of preferred parking districts.  The  City 
Council  may  designate by resolution after findings have been made as
hereinafter set forth certain streets or street, or any portion thereof, as a
"preferred parking district" as defined in § 11.04.132(B) of this code in
which district vehicles displaying a permit or other authorized indicia may
be exempt from parking prohibitions or restrictions otherwise posted, marked,
or noticed.



   (B)   Findings.  Each preferred parking district shall be so
designated only upon finding of the City Council that such district is
required to provide sufficient merchant and/or employee parking in order to
enhance or protect the quality of the economic life in or adjacent to the
area of the proposed district threatened by noise, traffic hazards,
environmental pollution, significant loss of revenue due to lack of customer
parking, or devaluation of real property resulting from the lack of adequate
customer and/or employee parking, and safeguard the economic well-being of
the city and its residents whose health, safety and welfare would be
adversely impacted by declining sales tax revenue or devaluation of real
property resulting from the lack of adequate parking for commercial/business
purposes, and that such district is necessary to provide reasonably available
and convenient parking for the benefit of those persons who shop, work, do
business or reside therein or adjacent thereto.



   (C)   Criteria for determination of findings.  Such findings shall
be based upon the following criteria:



      (1)   Nonbusiness-oriented vehicles, hereinafter referred to
as the "vehicles," do or may substantially and regularly interfere with the
use of the majority of available public streets or alley parking spaces by
adjacent businesses; as used herein, "businesses" shall include governmental
entities;



      (2)   The interference by such vehicles at regular and
significant daily or weekly intervals;



      (3)   Said vehicles being driven or parked in the area of the
proposed district cause or are the source of unreasonable noise, traffic
hazards, environmental pollution, detrimental economic well-being or
devaluation of real property in and/or adjacent to the area of the proposed
district;



      (4)   No unreasonable displacement of such vehicles will
likely result into areas surrounding the preferred parking district;



      (5)   A shortage of reasonably available and convenient
business/customer/employee related parking spaces exists in the area of the
proposed district; and

conditions and restrictions set forth in this chapter and of the preferred
parking district for which it was issued, including conditions and

guest preferred parking permits.

   (A)   In addition to and in accordance with the determination made
and the authority granted by the state of California under Cal. Veh. Code §
22660 to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inopera-tive vehicles or
parts thereof as public nuisances, the City Council hereby makes the
following findings and declarations:



   (B)   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public
property not including highways is hereby found to create a condition tending
to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration,
to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive
nuisance creating a hazard to the health and 1safety of minors, to create a
harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety
and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public
property not including highways, except as expressly herein-after permitted,
is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as
such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. The owner of the

and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his
reasons for such denial.

and take such other action as he deems appropriate under the circumstances to
carry out the purpose of this chapter. He may delay the time for removal of

it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the City Manager or his designee
may find that a vehicle, or part thereof, has been abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public property and order the
same removed from the properly as a public nuisance and disposed of as
hereinafter provided and determine the administrative costs and the cost of
removal to be charged against the owner of the parcel of land on which the
vehicle, or part thereof, is located. The order requiring removal shall
include a description of the vehicle, or part thereof, and the correct
identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the
site.

on the land without the consent of the landowner and that he has not
subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the City Manager or his designee
shall not assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against
the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to
collect such costs from the landowner.

Department shall cancel the notice of parking violation and make an adequate
record of the reasons for canceling the notice. The Finance Department shall
mail the results of the investigation to the person who contested the notice
of parking violation or the notice of delinquent parking violation.

written procedure established by the Finance Department which shall ensure
fair and impartial review of contested parking violations. The final decision

      (2)   If more than $400 in unpaid penalties and fees have been
accrued by any person or registered owner, proof thereof may be filed with
the court with the same effect as a civil judgment. Execution may be levied
and other measures may be taken for the collection of the judgment as are
authorized for the collection of an unpaid civil judgment entered against a
defendant in an action on a debtor. The court may assess costs against a
judgment debtor to be paid upon satisfaction of the judgment. The Finance
Department shall send a notice by first-class mail to the person or
registered owner indicating that a judgment shall be entered for the unpaid
penalties, fees, and costs and that, after 30 days from the date of the
mailing of the notice, the judgment shall have the same effect as an entry of
judgment against a judgment debtor. The person or registered owner shall also
be notified at that time that execution may be levied against his or her
assets, liens may be placed against his or her property, his or her wages may
be garnisheed, and other steps may be taken to satisfy the judgment. If a
judgment is rendered for the city, the city may contract with a collection

shall pay the established first paper civil filing fee at the time any entry
of civil judgment is requested.



      (4)   If the registration of the vehicle has not been renewed
for 60 days beyond the renewal date, and the citation has not been collected
by the Depart-ment of Motor Vehicles pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code § 4760, file
proof of unpaid penalties and fees with the court with the same effect as a
civil judgment as provided hereinabove in division (A)(2).



   (B)   The Finance Department shall not file a civil judgment with
the court relating to a parking violation which has been filed with the
Department of Motor Vehicles unless the Finance Department has deter-mined
that the registration of the vehicle has not been renewed for 60 days beyond
the renewal date and the citation has not been collected by the department
pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code § 4760.

the Department of Motor Vehicles under division (A)(1) hereof and the
Department of Motor Vehicles returns the notice of delinquent parking
violation by notice of noncollection pursuant to subdivision (b) of Cal. Veh.
Code § 4760 or § 4764, the Finance Department may elect to do either of the
following:

evidence pur-suant to division (A)(2) hereof.



      (2)   Cancel the notice of delinquent parking violation, in
which case no further proceedings shall occur.



   (D)   The time limitation provided by law for commencement of a
civil action for a violation specified in § 11.38.030 of this chapter shall
be tolled from and after the date a notice of delinquent parking violation is
filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to division (A)(1)
hereof until the notice is returned to the Finance Department under division
(A)(2) above or Cal. Veh. Code §§ 4760 or 4762 or 4764 or is recalled by
the Finance Department pursuant to § 11.38.150 of this chapter.

county issuing agency, other than the California Highway Patrol, within the
county, with the consent of that other entity, for the processing of notices
of parking violations and notices of delinquent parking viola-tions, prior to
filing with the court pursuant to § 11.38.180 of this chapter.

proceeds from such additional special assessment for any one or more of the

which it may have under the Parking and Business Improvement Area Law of
1965, as set forth in Cal. Sts. & High. Code §§ 36000 et seq.

   (A)   Upon receipt of written application conforming to the
requirements of the code and such plats, deposits, bonds, insurance and fees
as required, the Director of Public Works shall issue a written permit for
such excavation or fill. Issuance of a permit may be deferred, consistent
with division (E) below, or limits and conditions for doing the work may be
imposed as public necessity or convenience requires.



   (B)   Such permit shall state the name of the person to whom it is
issued; the streets and the particular portion or portions thereof to be
excavated or filled.



   (C)   No permits shall be transferable. Every such permit shall

is commenced within 60 days from date of issuance of the permit and the work
diligently prosecuted as provided therein.



   (D)   In the case of a public utility or other agency holding an
operating franchise in the city, the Director of Public Works may, on
application, subject to his or her discretion, issue a single blanket permit
for excavations, cancelable on ten days' written notice by the city. Such
permittees shall notify the Director of Public Works not less than 24 hours
in advance of any proposed operation on a form prescribed by the Director of
Public Works, and receive permission to conduct such operation before
proceeding therewith. The utility or other agency shall comply with all
applicable provisions of this code.



   (E)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no
excavation shall be permitted in a particular area of public street for 12
months after that area has been paved or resurfaced (including, but not 
limited to, asphalt overlay and slurry sealing).  Neither may more than two
excavations be permitted within any 12 month period in the same block of
public street for mid-block excavations, or the same intersection for
excavations in or traversing an intersection (the "excavation area").  The
12 month period shall be measured from the time each excavation is begun. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, excavation may be permitted in the case of
emergency or where such limitations are inconsistent with existing access
rights to the public right-of-way.



   (F)   It shall be unlawful for any person to install any service
pipe, main pipe, conduit, wire, cable, manholes, duct, tunnel or other
structure except manholes, culverts, catchbasins, vaults and similar
structures in any public street below the established gutter grade of any
street, or the surface of any public place at a distance less than that
designated by the city.



   (G)   The performance of any work under or by authority of a permit
issued under the provisions of this chapter shall constitute an acceptance by

manner so as to obstruct the street to the minimum. All work shall conform to
standards as designated by the Director of Public Works.



   (I)   The Director of Public Works and owners of structures and
substructures who may be affected by work done under the provisions of this
chapter shall be notified not less than 24 hours prior to time of starting
the work, except for service installation, service replacements and leak
repairs.



   (J)   In lieu of permitting any person to permanently resurface any
excavation made or replace improvements damaged or destroyed in a public
street, the city may, through its Director of Public Works, elect to do such
resurfacing or replacement with city equipment, materials and personnel, in
which event the person to whom the permit has been granted for making such
excavation shall post, as part of the special deposit with the city, such
sums of money as shall be designated by the Director of Public Works to pay
for resurfacing by the city.



   (K)   All excavation backfilling shall be done in accordance with
the specifications for street improvement in the city designated by the
Director of Public Works and the standards of the Public Works Department.
The Director of Public Works may, if it is deemed necessary, require the
permittee to dispose of the native material excavated and backfill with
select material or durable mineral aggregate.  The old torn up pavements and
other rubble shall be removed, together with any surplus excavated material,
within one working day from the time such material is placed upon the street,
provided that exceptions to this requirement may be approved by the
Director.  All of such materials must be recycled and/or diverted consistent
with the approved recycling/diversion plan.  After backfilling is completed,
and prior to repaving the cut, the contractor or permittee shall remove all
loose paving material and trim the edges of the excavation at the street
surface to the satisfaction of the Director.  Whenever any caving occurs in
the sidewalls of any excavation, the pavements above such caving shall be cut
away.  In no case shall any void under a pavement be filled by any side or
lateral tamping.



   (L)   The permittee shall place all trench backfill to a density of
95% optimum density for the first six inches under paving or sidewalks, 90%
of maximum density for the next underlying two feet, and 85% of maximum
density for the balance of any further underlying backfill. Density shall be
as measured by the modified American Association of State Highway Officials
methods. All other fill or backfill shall be placed to 95% of maximum
relative density as measured in the same manner. The permittee shall place
and maintain, until permanently repaired, a safe temporary slow-curing
asphaltic concrete surface patch at least one and one-half inches thick. Upon
request, the permittee shall furnish laboratory reports certifying compaction
results obtained.



   (M)   After any excavation in a public street has been made for the
purpose intended, the work of backfilling the excavation shall be completed
as soon as reasonably possible. The permittee shall guarantee the quality and
completeness of his work for a period of two years.



   (N)   Notwithstanding division (E) of this section, if a person
desires to excavate within 12 months after the area to be excavated has been
paved or resurfaced, and that excavation is not eligible as an emergency
excavation under § 13.20.180, such excavation may be permitted if the person
agrees to resurface the entire excavation area in which they desire to
excavate.  Such resurfacing shall be completed in accordance with
specifications designated by the Director of Public Works, and shall be
secured a completion bond or other security sufficient to ensure completion
of the work in a timely fashion.  The permittee shall guarantee the quality
and completeness of his work for a period of two years.

appliance in or under the surface of any public street, alley, sidewalk or
other public place, at any location, other than that described in the

the Director, and in accordance with the requirements of the permit.  If the
circumstances appearing after the excavation is commenced make it impossible
to comply with the permit, the Director may grant a waiver to take the
circumstances into account.



   (B)   Failure to comply with requirements set forth in this chapter
or on any permit shall be cause for revocation of the permit until the
violations have been corrected or alternative requirements have been approved
by the Director.

with § 13.20.190 available for inspection.



   (B)   To the extent feasible, the Director shall prepare a written
notice listing the street resurfacing planned by the city at least six months
in advance of that resurfacing.  The Director shall make the notice
available for public inspection.  The Director shall send the notice of the

places shall review the utility master plans, the city's paving plan, and the
atlas maps on file with the Director and shall coordinate, to the extent
practicable, with the utility and street work shown on such plans to minimize
damage to, and avoid undue disruption and interference with the public use of
such streets, alleys, sidewalks or other public places.



   (D)   Excavations in city streets disrupt and interfere with the
public use of city streets and damage the pavement.  The purpose of this
section is to reduce this disruption, interference and damage by promoting
better coordination among those making excavations in city streets and
between these persons and the city.  Better coordination will assist in
minimizing the number of excavations being made wherever feasible, and will
ensure that excavations in city streets are, to the maximum extent possible,
performed before, rather than after, the resurfacing of the streets by the
city.

§ 13.44.010  FINDINGS BY CITY.



   In enacting this chapter, the City Council hereby finds and determines
as follows:



   (A)   In certain portions of the city no sidewalks, curbs, gutters,
street lights, or street trees are presently installed. In other areas of the
city, inadequate sidewalks, curbs, gutters, catch basins, and/or street
paving presently exist. As a result thereof, the public has been and will
continue to be deprived of public right-of-way improvements  of the minimum
standards necessary for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access
and travel.



   (B)   The city has experienced substantial increases in population
and land development for high density and high activity purposes. As a direct
result thereof, the previously existing public right-of-way improvements
within much of the city in many instances have been and will continue to be
rendered inadequate to provide minimum acceptable service capacity for the
lands being developed within the city, and the public has been and will
continue to be increasingly denied public right-of-way improvements of the
minimum standards necessary for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian
access and travel within the city.



   (C)   The lack of adequate sidewalks in the city in many instances
forces pedestrians, particularly school children, to walk in the street and
be subjected to the hazards of vehicular traffic.



   (D)   The lack of adequate catch basins, curbs, and gutters in the
city causes poor drainage, causes the standing of water in puddles, renders
street sweeping more difficult, and results in the accumula-tion of filth. In
the absence of such curbs and gutters, there is no adequate place for garbage
and rubbish receptacles, as a result of which such containers are subjected
to hazards of vehicular traffic and there is an unnecessary spillage of
garbage and destruction of containers. Further, the lack of such curbs and
gutters subjects children or pedestrians in the normal sidewalk area to
increased risk of accidental injury by vehicular traffic.



   (E)   The lack of adequate street lighting reduces night visibility
and makes it more difficult for pedestrians to see where they are walking.



   (F)   The lack of such adequate public right-of-way improvements is
hereby found and declared to be dangerous to the public health and safety of
the inhabitants of the city.



('86 Code, § 13.44.010) (Ord. 3263, passed  - - ; Am. Ord. 3290, passed  -
- )



§ 13.44.020  PURPOSE AND POLICY.



   (A)   Purpose.  The provisions of this chapter are intended to
define the requirements, policies and procedures for the construction of
public improve-ments in connection with the development of real property
within the city in order to:



      (1)   Supplement the subdivision map act and the subdivision
ordinance and also the zoning ordinance of the city as set forth in Titles 22
and 23 of this code.



      (2)   Spread the costs of required public improvements upon
the abutting properties, as contemplated by law.



      (3)   Cause the installation of those improvements necessary
to serve properly the property developed at the time of its development so
that the benefitting property may enjoy the use of such improvements
throughout the normal life thereof and so that such improvements are not
indefinitely deferred to the detriment of the public interest, safety and
welfare.



      (4)   Protect the vested interest of the public in the
pre-existing capacity of such public improve-ments.



      (5)   Prevent the dissipation or improper use of the city's
general operating and maintenance funds in providing such improvements or in
maintaining faulty or substandard installation.



      (6)   Protect the public safety living standards and common
welfare of the general public.



   (B)   Policy.  It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city
that adequate public right-of-way improvements be installed along the street
line or lines of any lots or parcels hereafter improved with construction or
erection of any residence, commercial, industrial, multiple residential or
business purpose building, or open air parking or storage facility, in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The installation of adequate
right-of-way improvements shall include the dedication of additional
right-of-ways if necessary to meet mini-mum standard specifications and
design requirements of the city.



   (C)   Minimum requirements.  The provisions of this chapter are
minimum requirements and wherever any ordinance or other requirement of the
city requires additional improvements, or improvements of a higher degree or
grade, such ordinance or other determination shall control.



('86 Code, § 13.44.020) (Ord. 065-3263, passed 8-17-65; Am. Ord. 065-3290,
passed  12-21-65)



§ 13.44.030  PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.



   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any person
constructing, adding to or arranging for the construction of or the addition
to any building or dwelling, or any off-street parking facilities within the
city, the result of which causes an increase in the density of use of such
real property or which causes an increase in the traffic on the street
adjacent to such real property, shall also construct or provide for the
construction of public right-of-way improvements, including the dedication of
additional right-of-ways, if necessary, in accordance with standard
specifications and design requirements of the city along all public street
frontage adjoining the property upon which such work is to be done, unless
such public right-of-way improvements constructed in accordance with city
standards and design require-ments therefor already exist. No such alteration
or addition having a reasonable value of less than 50% of the reasonable
replacement value of any existing structure shall be deemed to result in such
an increase in the density of use of such real property or to cause an
increase in the traffic adjacent to such real property.



   (B)   The determination in each individual case as to whether or not
such public right-of-way improvements already exist in conformity with the
city's standards and design therefor shall be made by the Director of Public
Works, and an endorsement to that effect shall be made upon each building
permit at the time it is issued.



   (C)   As used in this chapter, the term PERSON shall mean and
include any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company or
organization of any nature whatsoever.

§ 13.44.040  EXTENT OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.



   The required public right-of-way improvements within the official plan
lines or public right-of-way abutting such lot or parcel of property or
portion of such lot or parcel of property shall be constructed within that
area encompassed by lines which are the prolongation of the exterior
boundaries of such land areas utilized in conjunction with such buildings or
structure, and such prolongation of lines shall be to the centerline of the
existing public right-of-way or to the centerline of the proposed public
right-of-way as shown on the general plan or adopted as official plan lines
abutting the lot or parcel of property or portion of the lot or parcel of
property to be so utilized. Such improvements may also be required to be
installed outside of the foregoing boundaries, provided that the improvements
outside of the boundaries are solely for the benefit of such abutting lot or
parcel of property or portion thereof.

§ 13.44.050  EXCEPTIONS.



   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply in either of the

public right-of-way improvements shall be completed prior to the final
inspection by the Director of Planning and Building of such construc-tion,
erection, addition or alteration, unless, in lieu of such construction, the
property owner elects to pay cash in the office of the City Treasurer in an
amount equal to the estimated cost of the construction of the required
improvements, as determined by the Director of Public Works. Furthermore, if
the immediate installation of such improvements would not be in the best
interests of the city, the Director of Public Works may require that a cash
payment be made in lieu of construction. In the event a cash payment is made

connections to any building or structure which does not comply with the
provisions of this section. It shall be the responsibility of the Director of
Public Works to notify the Director of Planning and Building that the
improvements required under the provisions of this chapter do not already
exist or have not been con-structed and accepted by the Director of Public
Works or that a cash payment has not been made in lieu of construction.

§ 13.44.070  MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Reasons.  When practical difficulties, unreasonable hardships
or results inconsistent with the general purposes of this chapter occur by
reason of the strict interpretation and application of any of the provisions
of this chapter, any property owner affected thereby may file an application
for relief from the provisions of those sections. Also, an owner or builder
dissatisfied with any determination of the Director of Public Works as to
whether the existing improvements are adequate, may file an application to
have the determination reviewed by the City Council.



   (B)   Filing application.  Each such application for relief shall
be filed in the office of the City Clerk within ten days from the date of
written notification to the property owner by the city of any such
deter-mination.



   (C)   Application form and contents.  Each such application shall
set forth the name and address of the applicant, description of the property
to which the application applies, a statement of the exact nature of the
modification or relief requested and the reasons therefor.



   (D)   Determination and order.  Upon finding that the existing
improvements are adequate, or that good cause has been shown and that the
strict enforcement of this code would not be consistent with the general
purposes of the sections and that there are practical difficulties or
unreasonable hardships which would result from the enforcement of the
provisions the City Council, under such conditions as it deems necessary to
assure that the spirit and purpose of these sections will be observed may
grant in each case such relief from the provisions of such sections as in the
determination of the City Council will secure the maximum compliance with the
provisions of the Sections without injustice to the applicant.

   (C)   Any removal of trees at city-owned facilities shall only be
accomplished after a review by the department head having jurisdiction of the
specific question of the necessity of removal. Any such tree required to be
removed shall be replaced as soon as it is practical to do so with another
tree either at the exact location where such tree was removed or in the same
general area.



   (D)   There shall be a full planting of street trees on all streets
adjacent to city facilities, except where the physical conditions of the site
prohibit such planting, in which case planting may be accomplished on the
city property adjacent to the sidewalk, or in an equivalent number on other
streets near the city facility.

§ 14.08.004  POLICY RELATIVE TO THE PLANTING OF STREET TREES.



   (A)   It shall be the policy of the city to maximize the planting of
trees alongside the streets of the city, and departments of the city which
presently administer existing requirements for such planting are encouraged
to fully apply their authority for that purpose.



   (B)   It shall be the policy of the city that every new project for
street construction or for construction of curb and gutter, or for
construction of sidewalk, by capital expenditure or through assessment
district, shall include full street tree planting. In cases in which lack of
parkway and narrowness of sidewalk prohibit such planting, this requirement
may be satisfied by planting on private property adjacent to the sidewalk in
an easement acquired for this purpose.



   (C)   Prior to the issuance of the building permit, the
Superintendent of Parks and Recreation shall certify either that street trees
exist to the satisfaction of standards established by the Parks and
Recreation Commission or that installation of such trees has been guaranteed
to their satisfaction. Where lack of parkway and narrowness of sidewalk
prohibit such planting, this requirement may be satisfied by plantings on the
property of the applicant, adjacent to the sidewalk, in an easement acquired
for that purpose. Exceptions may be granted in cases in which it would be
impossible or undesirable to place such trees. This provision shall not be
applied where the permit application is for repair, addition or improvement
of value of less than $1,000 for each tree required.

the plans therefor, shall make a specific and separate finding that such
removal is a practical necessity of the subject project.



   (B)   When a street tree is removed by the city, either as a
practical necessity or to eliminate a diseased, damaged, dangerous or dead
tree, such tree shall be replaced as soon as it is practical to do so with
another tree either at the exact location where such tree was removed or in
the same general area.



   (C)   When a living street tree is removed by a private individual
under permit from the city, it shall be a condition for the issuance of such
permit that the property owner replace such tree as soon as it is practical
to do so with another tree either at the exact location where such tree was
removed or in the same general area.

§ 15.18.010  GENERAL POLICY.



   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of this chapter is:



      (1)   To protect the public potable water supply of the city
from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the
customer's internal distribution system(s) or the consumer's private water
system(s) such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow into the
public water systems; and



      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing
cross-connections, actual or potential, between the consumer's in-plant
potable water system(s) and nonpotable water system(s), plumbing fixtures and
industrial piping systems; and



      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program
of cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent
the con-tamination or pollution of all potable water systems.



   (B)   Responsibility.  The Director shall be responsible for the
protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination
or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the
water service connection. If, in the judgment of the Director, an approved
backflow prevention assembly is required at the customer's water service
connection or within the customer's private water system for the safety of
the water system, the Director or his designated agent shall give notice in
writing to the customer to install such an approved backflow prevention
assembly(s) at specific location(s) on his premises. The consumer shall
immediately install such approved assembly(s) at the consumer's own expense;
and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install,
have tested and maintained the assembly(s) shall constitute a ground for
discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been
satis-factorily met.



('86 Code, § 15.18.010)  (Ord. 4073, passed  - - )



§ 15.18.020  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   APPROVED.  Accepted by the Director as meeting an applicable
specification stated or cited in this chapter or as suitable for the proposed
use.



   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY.  Any water supply on or available to the
premises other than the purveyor's approved public water supply. These
auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable
water supply or any natural source(s) such as a well, spring, river, stream,
harbor, and the like, or “used waters” or “industrial fluids.” These
waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and
constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does
not have sanitary control.



   BACKFLOW.  The reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either
backpressure or back-siphonage.



   BACKPRESSURE.  The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or
substances under pressure into the distribution pipes of a potable water
supply system from any source or sources other than the intended source.



   BACKSIPHONAGE.  The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or
substances into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply from any
source other than its intended source caused by the reduction of pressure in
the potable water supply system.



   BACKFLOW PREVENTER.  An assembly or means designed to prevent backflow.



      (1)    AIR-GAP.  The unobstructed vertical distance through
the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying water to a tank, plumbing, fixture or other device and the flood
level rim of the vessel. An approved AIR-GAP shall be at least double the
diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically, above the overflow rim of
the vessel; and in no case less than one inch.



      (2)    REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE ASSEMBLY.  An assembly of
two independently acting approved check valves together with a hydraulically
operating, mechanically independent differential pressure relief valve
located between the check valves and at the same time below the first check
valve. The unit shall include properly located test cocks and tightly closing
shut-off valves at each end of the assembly. The entire assembly shall meet
the design and performance specifications as deter-mined by a laboratory and
a field evaluation program resulting in an approval by a recognized and
agency approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. The
assembly shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two
check valves at an acceptable level less than the pressure on the public
water supply side of the assembly. At cessa-tion of a normal flow the
pressure between the two check valves shall be less than the pressure on the
public water supply side of the device. In case of leakage of either of the
check valves, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain the
reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by dis-charging to the
atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less,
the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved these
assemblies must be readily accessible for in-line testing and maintenance and
be installed in locations where no part of the assembly will be submerged.



      (3)    DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY.  An assembly of two
independently operating approved check valves with tightly closing shut-off
valves on each end of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for
the testing of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design
and performance specifications as determined by a laboratory and field
evaluation program resulting in an approval by a recognized and agency
approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. To be approved
these assemblies must be readily access-ible for inline testing and
maintenance.



   CONTAMINATION.  An impairment of the quality of the potable water by

§ 15.18.030  REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Water system.



      (1)   The water system shall be considered as made up of two
parts: The Utility System and the Customer System.



      (2)   Utility System shall consist of the source facilities
and the distribution system; and shall include all those facilities of the
water system under the complete control of the utility, up to the point where
the customer's system begins.



      (3)   That source shall include all components of the
facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage and delivery of
water to the distribution system.



      (4)   The distribution system shall include the network of
conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's
system.



      (5)   The customer's system shall include those parts of the
facilities beyond the termination of the utility distribution system which
are utilized in conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.



   (B)   Policy.



      (1)   No water service connection to any premises shall be
installed or maintained by the Water Purveyor unless the water supply is
protected as required by state laws and regulations and this ordinance.
Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the Water Purveyor
if a backflow prevention assembly required by this ordinance is not
installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow
prevention assembly has been removed, by-passed, or if an unprotected
cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until
such conditions or defects are corrected.



      (2)   The customer's system should be open for inspection at
all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city to determine
whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including
violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known,
the Director shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by
providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has
corrected the condition(s) in conformance with the state and city statutes
relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant
thereto.



      (3)   An approved backflow prevention assembly shall also be
installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the
property line or immediately inside the building being served; but, in all
cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the
following conditions exist:



         (a)   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water
supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality
and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the Director, the
public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line
appropriate to the degree of hazard.



         (b)   In the case of premises on which any industrial
fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as
to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the
public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line
appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of
process waters and waters originating from the utility system which have been
subject to deterioration in quality.



         (c)   In the case of premises having internal
cross-connection that cannot be permanently corrected or controlled, or
intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of
the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes making it
impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous
cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against
backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention
assembly in the service line.



      (4)   The type of protection that shall be provided to prevent
backflow into the public water supply shall be commensurate with the degree
of hazard that exists on the consumer's premises. The type of protective
device that may be required (listed in an increasing level of protection)
includes: Double Check Valve Assembly - (DC), Reduced Pressure Principle
Backflow Prevention Device (RP), and an Air-gap Separation - (AG). The water
user may choose a higher level of protection than required by the water
supplier. The minimum types of backflow protection required to protect the
public water supply, at the water user's connection to premises with various
degrees of hazard are given in Table 1 (see § 15.18.040). Situations which
are not covered in Table 1 shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the
appropriate backflow protection shall be determined by the water supplier or
health agency.



   (C)   Testing and maintenance of backflow presenters.



      (1)   The water supplier shall assure that adequate
maintenance and periodic testing are provided by the water user to ensure
their proper operation.



      (2)   Backflow presenters shall be tested by persons who have
demonstrated their competency in testing of these devices to the water
supplier or health agency.



      (3)   Backflow presenters shall be tested at least annually or
more frequently if determined to be necessary by the health agency or water
supplier. When devices are found to be defective, they shall be repaired or
replaced in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.



      (4)   Backflow presenters shall be tested immediately after
they are installed, relocated or repaired and not placed in service unless
they are functioning as required.



      (5)   The water supplier shall notify the water user when
testing of backflow presenters is needed. The notice shall contain the date
when the test must be completed.



      (6)   Reports of testing and maintenance shall be maintained
by the water supplier for a minimum of three years.



      (7)   Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall
be a model and size approved by the Director. The term “Approved Backflow
Preven-tion Assembly” shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in
full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works
Association entitled:



      AWWA C 506-84 Standards for Reduced Pressure Principles and
Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Devices; and, have met completely the
laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for
Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern
California established by:



      Specifications of Backflow Prevention Assemblies-Section 10 of
the most current issue of the MANUAL OF CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL



The AWWA and FCCC&HR standards and specifica-tions have been adopted by the
Director. Final approval shall be evidenced by a “Certificate of
Approval” issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full
compliance with the AWWA standards and FCCC&HR specifications:  The

      Los Angeles, California 90089-0231



Testing laboratories other than the laboratory listed above will be added to
an approved list as they are qualified by the Director.



      (8)   Backflow presenters which may be subjected to
backpressure or backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been
granted a Certificate of Approval by the qualified laboratory and are listed
on the laboratory's current list of “Approved Backflow Prevention
Assemblies” may be used without further test or qualification.



      (9)   It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any
premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified
inspections and operational tests made at left once per year. In those
instances where the Director deems the hazard to be great enough he may
require certified inspections at more frequent intervals. These inspections
and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by
the assembly manufacturer's representative, Department of Water and Power
personnel or by a certified tester approved by the Director. It shall be the
duty of the Director to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The
customer-user shall notify the Director in advance when the tests are to be
undertaken so that an official representative may witness the tests if so
desired. These assemblies shall be repaired overhauled or replaced at the
expense of the customer-user whenever the assemblies are found to be
defective. Records of such tests, repairs and overhaul shall be kept and made
available to the Director.



      (10)    All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies
which do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved devices
for the purposes described herein at the time of installa-tion and which have
been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance
require-ments under division (C)(9) of this section be excluded from the
requirements of these rules so long as the Director is assured that they will
satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing device is
moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or
when the Director finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health,
the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly
meeting the requirements of this section.

practical reduction in water consumption in his residential, commercial,
industrial, agricultural, or governmental water consumption, as the case may
be, other than in the specific area in which relief is being sought. No
relief shall be granted to any customer, who, when requested by the Water

§ 16.29.010  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.



   (A)   Establishment.  A sanitary sewer recon-struction program is
hereby established for the city.



   (B)   Purpose.  The need for relief sewers in the city is due to
the changing pattern of land use and the erection of many multi-story
buildings. The existing sewers in the city were constructed some 40 years ago
and are no longer adequate to accommodate the increased flow of sewage from
the areas being redeveloped. The overload in the sewers is directly
attributable to the volume of sewage generated and discharged by the larger
buildings to the system. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a means
of providing adequate sewers which are required for the redevelopment of the
city; to establish a charge to be collected from the properties that propose
to discharge into the public sewer quantities of sewage in excess of the
quantity for which the system was designed; and to establish an account
within the Sewer Fund in which these charges may be deposited and from which
moneys will be available for the sanitary sewer reconstruction program.



('86 Code, § 16.29.010) (Ord. 3890, passed  - - )



§ 16.29.020  MASTER PLAN.



   The sanitary sewer reconstruction program shall be implemented
basically in accordance with the city's official sewer master plan which is
on file in the office of the Director of Public Services/City Engineer. If
compliance with the official sewer master plan is impossible or impractical
because of peculiar conditions and the purposes of this chapter may be
accomplished and the public health, safety and welfare assured by an
alternate construction, the Director of Public Services/City Engineer, upon
so finding, may grant an exception to the official sewer master plan
permitting such alternate construction.



('86 Code, § 16.29.020) (Ord. 3890, passed  - - )



§ 16.29.030  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   AVERAGE FLOW.  The number of gallons of sewage discharged into the
public sewers during a 24-hour period.



   CITY.  The city of Alhambra.

   FLOOR AREA.  The area included within the surrounding walls of a
building, or portions thereof, exclusive of vent shafts and courtyards.



   LOT.  Any piece or parcel of land bounded, described or shown upon a
map, plat or deed recorded in the office of the Los Angeles County Recorder,
or shown as a separate parcel on the last equalized assessment roll which
conforms to the boundaries of such lot as shown upon such recorded map, plat,
deed or roll; provided, however, that in the event any building or structure
or intended use covers more area than a lot as defined herein, the term LOT
shall include all such pieces or parcels of land upon which the building or
structure or intended use is wholly or partially located, together with the
yards, courtyards and other unoccupied spaces legally required for the
building or structure.



   OWNER.  An individual, firm, partnership, corporation, organization or
other entity having an interest in any lot or parcel of land in the city.

('86 Code, § 16.29.050) (Ord. 3890, passed  - - )



§ 16.29.060  DETERMINATION OF CAPACITY.



   (A)   Capacity.  The Director of Public Services/ City Engineer
shall determine what capacity is necessary in each public sewer to provide
for the proper collection of sewage in the city. In the event a lot in the
city is to undergo development or redevelopment, and the anticipated sewage
from the proposed use is found by the Director of Public Services/City
Engineer to exceed the capacity available in the public sewer, the building
permit for such development or redevelopment shall not be issued until such
time as capacity in the public sewer is available or can be made available
before the building is occupied.



   (B)   Determination of capacity.  The size and grade of each public
sewer must be such as to provide at all times sufficient capacity for peak
flow rates of discharge. In order to establish estimates of sanitary sewage
at peak flow, the owner shall submit building plans and such other
information as the Director of Public Services/City Engineer may require on
printed forms provided for that purpose.

      BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES or BMPs. Methods, measures, schedules
of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other
management practices to prevent or reduce pollutants in discharges to the MS4
and thence into waters of the United States. BMPs include treatment
requirements, operating procedures and practices to control runoff, spillage
or leaks, sludge or waste disposal and drainage from raw material storage;
public education and outreach; proper planning of development projects;
structural and non-structural controls; and operations and maintenance
procedures which can be applied before, during and after pollution producing
activities, including, but not limited to proper clean-out of catch basins
and proper waste handling and disposal. See 40 C.F.R. § 122.2



      CONDITIONALLY EXEMPT ESSENTIAL NON-STORM WATER DISCHARGE. 
Conditionally exempt essential non-storm water discharges are certain
categories of discharges that are not composed entirely of storm water and
that are allowed by the Regional Water Board to discharge to the MS4, if in
compliance with all specified requirements; are not otherwise regulated by an
individual or general NPDES permit; and are essential public services that
are directly or indirectly required by other State or federal statute and/or
regulation. These include non-storm water discharges from drinking water
supplier distribution system releases and nonemergency fire fighting
activities. Conditionally exempt essential non-storm water discharges may

including SUSMP and County of Los Angeles LID Standards Manual 2009.



(Ord. 4654, passed 3-10-14)



§ 16.36.030  DEFINITIONS.



   Except as specifically provided herein, any term used in this Chapter
16.36 shall be defined as that term in the current Municipal NPDES permit, or
if it is not specifically defined in either the Municipal NPDES permit, then
as such term is defined in the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and/or
the regulations promulgated there under. If the definition of any term
contained in this chapter conflicts with the definition of the same term in
the current Municipal NPDES permit, then the definition contained in the
Municipal NPDES permit shall govern. The following words and phrases shall
have the following meanings when used in this chapter:



   AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE FACILITY means a facility that is categorized in any
one of the following



Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) codes. For inspection purposes, permittees need
not inspect facilities with SIC codes 5013, 5014, 5541, 5511, provided that
these facilities have no outside activities or materials that may be exposed
to stormwater (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).



   BASIN PLAN means the Water Quality Control Plan, Los Angeles Region,
Basin Plan for the Coastal Watersheds of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties,
adopted by the Regional Water Board on June 13, 1994 and subsequent
amendments (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).



   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP) means practices or physical devices or
systems designed to prevent or reduce pollutant loading from stormwater or
non-stormwater discharges to receiving waters, or designed to reduce the
volume of stormwater or non-stormwater discharged to the receiving water
(Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).



   BIOFILTRATION means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater pollutant
discharges by intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through
incidental infiltration and/or evapotranspiration, and filtration. Incidental
infiltration is an important factor in achieving the required pollutant load
reduction. Therefore, the term BIOFILTRATION as used in this ordinance is
defined to include only systems designed to facilitate incidental
infiltration or achieve the equivalent pollutant reduction as biofiltration
BMPs with an underdrain (subject to approval by the Regional Board’s
Executive Officer). Biofiltration BMPs include bioretention systems with an
underdrain and bioswales (Modified from: Order No. R4-2012-0175).



   BIORETENTION means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater runoff by
intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through evapotranspiration
and infiltration. The bioretention system typically includes a minimum 2-foot
top layer of a specified soil and compost mixture underlain by a
gravel-filled temporary storage pit dug into the in-situ soil. As defined in
the Municipal NPDES permit, a bioretention BMP may be designed with an
overflow drain, but may not include an underdrain. When a bioretention BMP is
designed or constructed with an underdrain it is regulated by the Municipal
NPDES permit as biofiltration (Modified from: Order No. R4-2012-0175).



   BIOSWALE means a LID BMP consisting of a shallow channel lined with
grass or other dense, low-growing vegetation. BIOSWALES are designed to
collect stormwater runoff and to achieve a uniform sheet flow through the
dense vegetation for a period of several minutes (Source: Order No.

original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or original purposes of the
facility. See “routine maintenance” definition for further explanation.
Where clearing, grading or excavating of underlying soil takes place during a
repaving operation, State General Construction Permit coverage by the State
of California General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with
Industrial Activities or for Stormwater Discharges Associated with
Construction Activities is required if more than one acre is disturbed or the
activities are part of a larger plan (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).



   CONTROL means to minimize, reduce or eliminate by technological, legal,
contractual, or other means, the discharge of pollutants from an activity or
activities (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

reconstruction of any public or private residential project (whether
single-family, multi-unit or planned unit development); industrial,
commercial, retail, and other non-residential projects, including public
agency projects; or mass grading for future construction. It does not include
routine maintenance to maintain original line and grade, hydraulic capacity,
or original purpose of facility, nor does it include emergency construction
activities required to immediately protect public health and safety (Source:
Order No. R4-2012-0175).

with Green Infrastructure: Green Streets (December 2008 EPA-833-F-08-009) to
the maximum extent practicable.



   (C)   The remainder of planning priority projects shall prepare a
LID Plan to comply with the following:



      (1)   Retain stormwater runoff onsite for the Stormwater
Quality Design Volume (SWQDv) defined as the runoff from:



         (a)   The 85th percentile 24-hour runoff event as
determined from the Los Angeles County 85th percentile precipitation
isohyetal map; or

24-hour rain event, whichever is greater.



      (2)   Minimized hydromodification impacts to natural drainage
systems as defined in the Municipal NPDES permit.



      (3)   When, as determined by the City, 100 percent onsite
retention of the SWQDv is technically infeasible, partially or fully, the
infeasibility shall be demonstrated in the submitted LID Plan. The technical
infeasibility may result from conditions that may include, but are not
limited to:



         (a)   The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils
is less than 0.3 inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend
the in-situ soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve
reliable performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the
SWQDv onsite.



         (b)   Locations where seasonal high groundwater is
within five to ten feet of surface grade;



         (c)   Locations within 100 feet of a groundwater well
used for drinking water;

         (f)   Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations
where the density and/or nature of the project would create significant
difficulty for compliance with the onsite volume retention requirement.



      (4)   If partial or complete onsite retention is technically
infeasible, the project Site may biofiltrate 1.5 times the portion of the
remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained onsite. Biofiltration BMPs must
adhere to the design specifications provided in the Municipal NPDES Permit.



         (a)   Additional alternative compliance options such as
offsite infiltration may be available to the project site. The project site
should contact the City to determine eligibility. Alternative compliance
options are further specified in County of Los Angeles LID Standards Manual
2009 or as may later be amended.



      (5)   The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or
biofiltered onsite must be treated onsite to reduce pollutant loading. BMPs
must be selected and designed to meet pollutant-specific benchmarks as
required per the Municipal NPDES Permit. Flow-through BMPs may be used to
treat the remaining SWQDv and must be sized based on a rainfall intensity of:



         (a)   0.2 inches per hour, or



         (b)   The one year, one-hour rainfall intensity as
determined from the most recent Los Angeles County isohyetal map, whichever
is greater.

requirements of this section for all of its phases by: (a) designing a system
acceptable to the City to satisfy these standards and requirements for the
entire site during the first phase, and (b) implementing these standards and
requirements for each phase of development or redevelopment of the Site
during the first phase or prior to commencement of construction of a later
phase, to the extent necessary to treat the stormwater from such later phase.
For purposes of this section, MULTI-PHASED PROJECT shall mean any planning
priority project implemented over more than one phase and the site of a
multi-phased project shall include any land and water area designed and used
to store, treat or manage stormwater runoff in connection with the

properly and shall be maintained in continuous operation according to
manufacturer’s guidelines and the City’s requirements.



      (3)   Sewer lines to and from GRDs shall be kept in good
repair and clear of any buildup of FOG that could potentially contribute to
backups and/or SSOs.



      (4)   All FOG discharged during GRD or sewer line cleaning and
maintenance shall be captured. Any FSE that has their kitchen grease waste
lines, exit lines from a GRD and/or laterals cleaned by jetting or hydro
flushing shall have the contractor capture the contents removed from the line
to prevent SSOs, depending on the main size that the lateral feeds into. All
contents removed from sewer lines shall be contained and disposed of properly
by a licensed contractor.



      (5)   No additives may be introduced to the GRDS or a FSEs
wastewater system for the purpose of emulsifying FOG or
biologically/chemically treating FOG for grease remediation or as a
supplement to interceptor maintenance unless a specific written authorization
from the City is obtained. Systems or additives, such as solvents or enzymes
that dissolve or mobilize FOG are prohibited.



      (6)   All GRDS shall be completely cleaned out by a registered
waste hauler prior to the closure of an FSE, the associated building or a
change in ownership.



   (B)   GRD maintenance frequency.



      (1)   The maintenance frequency shall be set so as to ensure
that the minimum hydraulic retention time and available hydraulic volume is
maintained to effectively intercept and retain FOG and minimize the passage
of FOG to the sanitary sewer collection system. The maintenance frequency for
all FSEs with a GRD shall be determined by one of the following methods:



         (a)   GRDS shall be fully pumped out and cleaned at a
frequency such that the combined FOG and solids accumulation does not exceed
25% of the total design hydraulic depth in any location of the GRD. The 25%
rule shall apply to all GRDS.



         (b)   The entire contents of all grease interceptors
(gravity grease interceptors) and GRDs greater than 100 gallons shall be
removed every three months or more frequently as to prevent FOG from entering
the sanitary sewer.



         (c)   The entire contents of all grease traps (hydro
mechanical grease interceptors) shall be removed every month or more
frequently as to prevent FOG from entering into the sanitary sewer.



         (d)   The entire contents of all automatically or
mechanically cleaning GRD shall be removed every six months or more
frequently as to prevent FOG from entering into the sanitary sewer.



      (2)   The maintenance frequency may be adjusted when
sufficient data have been obtained to establish an appropriate frequency
based on the guidelines adopted pursuant to the FOG program.



         (a)   The City may modify the maintenance frequency at
any time to reflect changes in actual operating conditions in accordance with
the FOG program. Based on the actual generation of FOG from the FSE, the
maintenance frequency may increase or decrease.



         (b)   The owner/operator of a FSE may submit a request
to the City requesting a change in the maintenance frequency at any time. The
FSE has the burden of responsibility to demonstrate that the requested change
in frequency reflects actual operating conditions based on the average FOG
accumulation over time and meeting the requirements described in subsection
(B)(1)(a), and that it is in full compliance with the conditions of this
ordinance. Upon determination by the City that the requested revision is
justified accordingly to reflect the change in maintenance frequency.



         (c) If the GRD, at any time, contains FOG and solids
accumulation that does not meet the requirements described in subsection
(B)(1)(a), the FSE shall have the GRD serviced immediately such that all FOG,
solids, and other materials are completely removed from the GRD.

use of fryers, automatically or mechanically cleaning GRDS which need FSE
staff maintenance, rotisserie drip lines not connected to a GRD or any other
type of grease and oil waste created by cooking or cleaning of equipment. FSE
staff, not limited to kitchen staff, shall properly dispose of grease or oils
from cooking equipment into an oil/grease receptacle such as a tallow bin,
barrel, or drum. Appropriate measures shall be taken to eliminate spills.
Absorbent material shall be immediately available each time the waste
oil/grease is emptied into the tallow bin or segregated receptacle. The
transporting of waste oil/grease shall be conducted with a covered and sealed
container.



      (3)   Tallow bins or used waste oil and grease container areas
shall be kept clean. Containers shall be covered with lids and free from
excessive fats, oil, and grease and debris. Housekeeping procedures shall be
put in place and signs posted.



      (4)   FSEs with improperly maintained tallow bins shall
relocate the bins to a covered location to reduce the risk of spills and
discharges to the storm drain collection system. The tallow bin shall be
repositioned in a covered trash enclosure or inside the facility in
compliance with all local and state regulations.



   (B)   Tallow hauler.

and emergency responders during emergency operations.



   101.4 Severability. If a section, subsection, sentence, clause or

decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this code.



   101.5 Validity. In the event any part or provision of this code is held
to be illegal or void, this shall not have the effect of making void or
illegal any of the other parts or provisions hereof, which are determined to
be legal; and it shall be presumed that this code would have been adopted
without such illegal or invalid parts or provisions.



   SECTION 102 APPLICABILITY

this code and the Building Code. Subject to the approval of the fire code
official, the use or occupancy of an existing structure shall be allowed to
be changed and the structure is allowed to be occupied for purposes in other

or life safety.



   105.2 Application. Application for a permit required by this code shall

the fire code official. Applications for permits shall be accompanied by such
plans as prescribed by the fire code official.



      105.2.1 Refusal to issue permit. If the application for a permit
describes a use that does not conform to the requirements of this code and
other pertinent laws and ordinances, the fire code official shall not issue a
permit, but shall return the application to the applicant with the refusal to
issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and
shall contain the reasons for refusal.



      105.2.2 Inspection authorized. Before a new operational permit is
approved, the fire code official is authorized to inspect the receptacles,
vehicles, buildings, devices, premises, storage spaces or areas to be used to
determine compliance with this code or any operational constraints required.



      105.2.3 Time limitation of application. An application for a
permit for any proposed work or operation shall be deemed to have been
abandoned one year after the date of filing, unless such application has been
diligently prosecuted or a permit shall have been issued. When requested in
writing by the applicant prior to or not more than 90 days after the
expiration of application, the fire official may extend the time for action
by the applicant. The time for action by the applicant shall not be extended
beyond the effective date of a more current Code. Additional hourly fees for
plan review shall also be paid to the fire official for enforcement of any
requirements which were subsequently amended to the Code in effect at the
time the plan check extension is requested. Once an application and any
extension thereof has expired, the applicant shall submit a new application
and pay a new application fee.



   105.3 Conditions of a permit. A permit shall constitute permission to
maintain, store or handle materials; or to conduct processes which produce
conditions hazardous to life or property; or to install equipment utilized in
connection with such activities; or to install or modify any fire protection
system or equipment or any other construction, equipment installation or
modification in accordance with the provisions of this code where a permit is
required by Section 105.6 or 105.7. Such permission shall not be construed as
authority to violate, cancel or set aside any of the provisions of this code
or other applicable regulations or laws of the jurisdiction.



      105.3.1 Expiration of Permit. An operational permit shall remain
in effect until reissued, renewed, or revoked or for such a period of time as
specified in the permit. Construction permits issued by the fire official
under the provisions of this Code shall expire automatically by limitation
and become null and void one year after the date of the last required
inspection approval by the fire official, or if work authorized by such
permit is not commenced within one year from the issuance date of such
permit. Before such work can be commenced or recommenced, a new permit shall
be first obtained.



      Supplementary permit(s) shall not expire so long as the
associated building permit remains active.

   101 - TITLE, PURPOSE AND INTENT



   101.1 Title. Title XX Building and Construction, Chapter 20.05 of the
City of Alhambra Municipal Code shall be known as the Building Code of the
City of Alhambra, may be cited as such, and will be referred to herein as
“these regulations” or “these building standards” or “this Code.”



   101.2 Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this code is to establish the
minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety and general
welfare through structural strength, means of egress facilities, stability,
sanitation, adequate light and ventilation, energy conservation, and safety
to life and property from fire and other hazards attributed to the built
environment and to provide safety to firefighters and emergency responders
during emergency operations. Consistent with this purpose, the provisions of
this Code are intended and always have been intended to confer a benefit on
the community as a whole and are not intended to establish a duty of care
toward any particular person.



   This Code shall not be construed to hold the City or any officer,
employee or agent thereof responsible for any damage to persons or property
by reason of any inspection authorized herein or by reason of the issuance or
nonissuance of any permit authorized herein, and/or for any action or
omission in connection with the application and/or enforcement of this Code.
By adopting the provisions of this Code, the City does not intend to impose
on itself, its employees or agents any mandatory duties of care toward
persons and property within its jurisdiction so as to provide a basis of
civil liability for damages. This section is declaratory of existing law and
is not to be construed as suggesting that such was not the purpose and intent
of previous Code adoptions.



   101.3 Scope and Applicability. The provisions of this Code shall apply
to the erection, construction, enlargement, alteration, installation,
reconstruction, repair, movement, improvement, connection, conversion,
demolition, use and occupancy of any building, structure or premises, or
portion thereof, and grading within the City.



   The provisions of this Code shall not apply to work located primarily
in a public way other than pedestrian protection structures required by
Chapter 33; public utility towers and poles; equipment not specifically
regulated in this Code; hydraulic flood control structures; work exempted by
Section 107.2; or minor work of negligible hazard to life specifically
exempted by the building official.



   Additions, alterations, repairs and changes of use or occupancy in all
buildings and structures shall comply with the provisions for new buildings
and structures except as otherwise provided in Section 109 of this Code and
Chapter 20.11 Existing Building Code of City of Alhambra.



   Detached one- and two family dwellings and multiple single-family
dwellings (townhouses) not more than three stories above grade plane in
height with a separate means of egress and their accessory structures shall
comply with the Residential Code as amended and adapted by the City of
Alhambra.



   Where, in any specific case, different sections of this Code specify
different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most
restrictive shall govern.



   The codes and standards referenced in this Code shall be considered
part of the requirements of this Code to the prescribed extent of each such
reference. Where differences occur between provisions of this Code and
referenced codes and standards, the provisions of this Code shall apply.



   The provisions of this Code shall not be deemed to nullify any
provisions of local, state or federal law. In the event, any differences in
requirements exist between the accessibility requirements of this Code and
the accessibility requirements of the California Code of Regulations, Title
24 (also referred to as the California Building Standards Code), then the
California Code of Regulations shall govern.



   102 - UNSAFE BUILDINGS



   102.1 Definition. All buildings or structures which are structurally
unsound or not provided with adequate egress, or which constitute a fire
hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to
existing use constitute a hazard to safety or health, or public welfare, by
reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire hazard,
disaster damage, lacking an approved water supply, hazardous electrical,
unsafe gas piping or appliances or abandonment as specified in this Code or
any other effective ordinance, are, for the purpose of this Chapter, unsafe
buildings. Whenever the Building Official determines by inspection that a
building or structure, whether structurally damaged or not, is dangerous to
human life by reason of being located in an area which is unsafe due to
hazard from landslide, settlement, or slippage or any other cause, such
building shall, for the purpose of this Chapter, be considered an unsafe
building.



   No person shall own, use, occupy or maintain any unsafe building.



   All unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be public nuisances. In
addition to instituting any appropriate action to prevent, restrain or
correct a violation of this section, the Building Official may abate an
unsafe condition or order that the unsafe condition be secured, repaired,
rehabilitated, demolished or removed as deemed necessary by the Building
Official in accordance with the procedure specified in this Code. As used in
this Chapter “party concerned” means the person, if any, in real or
apparent charge and control of the premises involved, the record owner, the
holder of any mortgage, trust deed or other lien or encumbrance of record,
the owner or holder of any lease of record, the record holder of any other
estate or interest in or to the building or structure or the land upon which
it is located.



   102.2 Notice of Unsafe Building. The Building Official shall examine or
cause to be examined every building or structure or portion thereof reported
as dangerous or damaged and, if, in the Building Official's opinion, such is
found to be an unsafe building as defined in this Chapter, the Building
Official shall give to the party concerned written notice stating the defects
thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in charge of the
building or premises to:



   1.   Immediately remove, backfill, shore up or secure such unsafe
condition, and/or



   2.   Within 48 hours, apply for required permit(s) and commence
either the required repairs or improvements or demolition and removal of the
building or structure or portions thereof.



   All such work shall be completed within 90 days from date of notice,
unless otherwise stipulated by the Building Official. If necessary, such
notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to be
vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected and approved by the Building Official.



   Proper service of such notice shall be by personal service or by
registered or certified mail upon every party concerned. In the event the
Building Official, after reasonable effort, is unable to serve the notice as
specified above, proper service shall be by posting on the structure a copy
of the notice. The designated period within which the owner or person in
charge is required to comply with such notice shall begin as of the date the
owner or person in charge receives such notice by personal service or
registered or certified mail. If such notice is by posting, the designated
period shall begin ten days following the date of posting.



   The failure of any owner or other person to receive such notice shall
not affect in any manner the validity of any proceedings taken hereunder.



   A person notified to vacate an unsafe building by the Building Official
shall vacate within the time specified in the order.



   The Building Official may record a notice of violation with the County
Recorder’s Office that the building or structure described has been
inspected and found to be an unsafe building, as



   defined in this Chapter, and that the owner thereof has been so
notified. After all required work has been completed, upon request and
payment of required fee(s) the Building Official shall record a notice
rescinding the prior notice of violation with the County Recorder’s Office.



   102.3 Posting of Signs. The Building Official shall cause to be posted
on buildings required to be vacated or remain unoccupied a notice to read
substantially as follows: “Restricted Use” or “Unsafe - Do Not Enter or
Occupy” as described in Section 102.6. All placards shall read
“Department of Community Development, City of Alhambra.”



   Such notice shall be posted at the main entrance and shall be visible
to persons approaching the building or structure from a street. Such notice
shall remain posted until the required repairs, demolition or removal are
completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written permission of the
Building Official and no person shall enter the building except for the
purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the building.



   102.4 Unsafe Buildings: Hearing.



      102.4.1 Right of hearing. The party concerned or the Building
Official may request a hearing regarding the unsafe condition of the building
or structure. The request by the interested party shall be made in writing to
the Building Official within 30 days of the date of the notice of the unsafe
condition. A hearing shall be requested by the Building Official prior to
demolition or repair of an unsafe building by the City except when such
demolition or repair is done under the emergency procedure set forth in this
Chapter. All interested parties who desire to be heard may appear before the
Building Board of Appeals to show cause why the building or structure should
not be ordered repaired, vacated and repaired, or demolished.



      102.4.2 Notice of hearing. Not less than ten days prior to the
hearing, the Building Official shall serve or cause to be served either in
the manner required by law for the service of summons or by first class mail,
postage prepaid, a copy of the notice of hearing upon every party concerned.



      102.4.3 Form and contents of notice. The notice of hearing shall
state:



      1.   The street address and a legal description sufficient for
identification of the premises upon which the building or structure is
located.



      2.   The conditions because of which the Building Official
believed that the building or structure is an unsafe building.



      3.   The date, hour and place of the hearing.



      102.4.4 Posting of notice. The Building Official shall post one
copy of the notice of hearing in a conspicuous place on the unsafe building
involved, not less than ten days prior to the hearing.



      102.4.5 Hearing by Building Board of Appeals. The Building Board
of Appeals shall hold a hearing and consider all competent evidence offered
by any person pertaining to the matters set forth in the report of the
Building Official.



      The Building Board of Appeals shall make written findings of fact
as to whether or not the building or structure is an unsafe building as
defined in this Chapter.



      When determined by the Building Official, the Building
Rehabilitation Appeals Board shall hold the hearing in lieu of the Building
Board of Appeals.



      102.4.6 Order. If the Building Board of Appeals finds that the
building or structure is an unsafe building, it shall make an order based on
its finding that:



      1.   The building or structure is an unsafe building and
directing that repairs be made and specifying such repairs, or



      2.   The building or structure is an unsafe building and
directing that it be vacated and that specified repairs be made, or



      3.   The building or structure is an unsafe building and
directing that it shall be vacated and demolished.



      The order shall state the time within which the work required
must be commenced, which shall not be less than 10 nor later than 30 days
after the service of the order. The order shall state a reasonable time
within which the work shall be completed. The Building Board of Appeals for
good cause may extend the time for completion in writing.



      The order shall be served upon the same parties and in the same
manner as required by Section 102.4.2 for the notice of hearing. It shall
also be conspicuously posted on or about the building or structure.



   102.5 Unsafe Buildings: Demolition or Repair.



      102.5.1 Work by City. If the repairs or demolition necessary to
remove the unsafe condition as set forth in the Notice of Unsafe Building is
not made within the designated period and a hearing has not been requested by
any party concerned, the Building Official shall request that a hearing be
held regarding the unsafe condition. If the finding by the Building Board of
Appeals is not complied with within the period designated by the Board, the
Building Official may then secure or demolish such portions of the structure,
or may cause such work to be done, to the extent necessary to eliminate the
hazard determined to exist by the Building Board of Appeals.



      102.5.2 Emergency procedure. Whenever any portion of a structure
constitutes an immediate hazard to life or property, and in the opinion of
the Building Official, the conditions are such that repairs, or demolition
must be undertaken within less than the designated period, the Building
Official may take necessary action, such as performing alterations, repairs,
and/or demolition of the structures, to protect life or property, or both,
after giving such notice to the parties concerned as the circumstances will
permit or without any notice whatever when, in the Building Official’s
opinion, immediate action is necessary.



      102.5.3 Costs. The costs incurred by actions taken pursuant to
Sections 102.5.1 and 102.5.2 including the entire cost of the services
rendered by the County, shall be a special assessment against the property
upon which the structure stood. The Building Official shall notify, in
writing, all parties concerned of the amount of such assessment resulting
from such work. Within five days of the receipt of such notice, any such
party concerned may file with the Building Official a written request for a
hearing on the correctness or reasonableness, or both, of such assessment.
Any party concerned who did not receive a notice pursuant to Section 102.2
and who has not had a hearing on the necessity of the demolition or repairs
in such request for hearing also may ask that such necessity be reviewed. The
Building Board of Appeals thereupon shall set the matter for hearing; give
such party concerned notice thereof as provided in Section 102.4.2; hold such
hearing and determine the reasonableness or correctness of the assessment, or
both; and if requested, determine the necessity of the demolition or repairs.
The Building Board of Appeals, in writing, shall notify such party concerned
of its decision. If the total assessment determined as provided for in this

      103.4.1 General. The Building Official may record a notice with
the County Recorder’s Office that a property, building, or structure, or
any part thereof, is in violation of any provision of this Code provided that
the provisions of this Section are complied with. The remedy provided by this
Section is cumulative to any other enforcement actions permitted by this Code.



      103.4.2 Recordation. If (1) the Building Official determines that
any property, building, or structure, or any part thereof is in violation of
any provision of this Code; and if (2) the Building Official gives written
notice as specified below of said violation; then the Building Official may
have sole discretion to, at any time thereafter, record with the County
Recorder’s Office a notice that the property and/or any building or
structure located thereon is in violation of this Code.



      Following the recordation of the notice of violation the Building

responsibility of the property owner, occupant or other similarly interested
private party to comply with the above provisions.



      103.4.3 Notice. The written notice given pursuant to this Section
shall indicate:

owner-builder of a one- or two-family dwelling, accessory building or
accessory structure had no knowledge that a permit was necessary and had not
previously applied for a permit from the Building Division of the City of
Alhambra the investigation fee shall be specified as per the section 115.

makes such building, structure, or grading, or premises hazardous, unsafe, or
dangerous for any reason specified in this Code or other similar law, the
Building Official or an authorized representative hereby is authorized to
enter such property at any reasonable time and to inspect the same and
perform any duty imposed upon the Building Official by this Code or other
applicable law; provided that (i) if such property is occupied, then the

request entry explaining the reasons therefor; and (ii) if such property is
unoccupied, then the Building Official shall first make a reasonable effort
to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the property

property cannot be found after due diligence or if entry is refused, then the
Building Official or an authorized representative shall have recourse to
every remedy provided by law to secure lawful entry and inspect the property.

construction, the Building Official may require tests as proof of compliance
to be made at the expense of the owner or the owner’s agent by an approved
agency.



      Test methods shall be as specified by this Code for the material

engineer of record who shall perform all of the duties required of the
original architect or engineer of record. The building official shall be
notified in writing by the owner if the architect or engineer of record is
changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties.



   The architect or engineer of record shall be responsible for reviewing
and coordinating all submittal documents prepared by others, including
deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building.



   106.3 Information Required on Building Plans. Plans shall be drawn to
scale upon substantial paper or other material suitable to the building
official, shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the nature and scope of
the work proposed, and shall show in detail that the proposed construction
will conform to the provisions of this Code and all relevant laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations.



   The first sheet of each set of plans shall give the street address of
the proposed work and the name, address and telephone number of the owner(s)
and all persons who were involved in the design and preparation of the plans.



   Plans shall include a plot plan showing the location of the proposed
building and of every existing building on the premises. In lieu of specific
details, the building official may approve references on the plans to a
specific section or part of this Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules
and/or regulations. Computations, stress diagrams and other data sufficient
to show the correctness of the plans shall be submitted when required by the
Building Official.



   When deemed necessary by the building official, the first sheet of each
set of plans shall indicate the following information:



   1.   The building Type of Construction;



   2.   Whether fire sprinklers are installed in all or any portion of
the building;



   3.   Existing building areas and areas of all additions;



   4.   The number of stories of the building;



   5.   The use of all new and existing rooms and/or areas;



   6.   The Occupancy Classifications of each occupancy;



   7.   The Code in effect on the date of plan check submittal.



   The plans shall show all mitigation measures required under the
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued to the
City. For the application of NPDES permit requirements as they apply to
grading plans and permits, see Appendix J of this code. For additional
provisions applicable to grading, see Appendix J.



   106.4 Drainage Review Requirement. Where proposed construction will
affect site drainage, existing and proposed drainage patterns shall be shown
on the plot plan.



   A site inspection may be required prior to plan check of building plans
for lots or parcels in areas having slopes of five horizontal to one vertical
(5:1) or steeper when the building official finds that a visual inspection of
the site is necessary to establish drainage requirements for the protection
of property, existing buildings or the proposed construction. The fee for
such inspection shall be as set forth by ordinance or resolution. Such a
preinspection shall not be required for a building pad graded under the
provisions of Appendix J.



   For additional provisions applicable to grading, see Appendix J.



   106.5 Deferred submittals. For the purposes of this section, deferred
submittals are defined as those portions of the design which are not
submitted at the time of the application and which are to be submitted to the
building official within a specified period.



   Deferral of any submittal items shall have prior approval of the
building official. The architect or engineer of record shall list the
deferred submittals on the plans and shall submit the deferred submittal
documents for review by the building official.



   Submittal documents for deferred submittal items shall be submitted to
the architect or engineer of record who shall review them and forward them to
the building official with a notation indicating that the deferred submittal
documents have been reviewed and that they have been found to be in general
conformance with the design of the building. The deferred submittal items
shall not be installed until their design and submittal documents have been
approved by the building official.



   106.6 Standard Plans. The building official may approve a set of plans
for a building or structure as a “standard plan,” provided that the
applicant has made proper application and submitted complete sets of plans as
required by this section.



   Plans shall reflect laws and ordinances in effect at the time a permit
is issued except as provided in this section. Nothing in this section shall
prohibit modifying the permit set of plans to reflect changes in laws and
ordinances which have become effective since the approval of the standard
plan. The standard plans shall become null and void where the work required
by such changes exceeds five percent of the value of the building or
structure.



   Standard plans shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of
approval. This period may be extended by the building official when there is
evidence that the plans may be used again and the plans show compliance with
this Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.



   106.7 Expiration of Plan Check Applications. Plan check applications
for which no permit is issued within one year following the date of
application shall expire by limitation and become null and void. Plans and
calculations previously submitted may thereafter be returned to the applicant
or destroyed by the building official.



   When requested in writing by the applicant and prior the effective date
of a more current code, the Building Official within their discretion may
grant extension(s) not exceeding 1 year provided;



   1.   Circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have
prevented action from being taken;



   2.   An extension fee is paid as determined by the Building
Official, not to exceed 25 percent of the plan check fee.



   Once an application and any extension thereof has expired, the
applicant shall resubmit plans and calculations and pay a new application fee.



   106.8 Retention of Plans. One set of approved plans, calculations and
reports shall be retained by the building official. Except as required by
Section 19850 of the Health and Safety Code, the building official shall
retain such set of the approved plans, calculations and reports for a period
of not less than 90 days from date of completion of the work covered therein.

first file an application in writing on a form furnished by the City for that
purpose. Each such application shall:



   1.   Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit for
which application is made.



   2.   Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by
lot, block, tract, street address, or similar description that will readily
identify and locate the proposed building or work.



   3.   Show the use and occupancy of all parts of the building.



   4.   Be accompanied by plans and calculations as required in Section
106.



   5.   State the valuation of the proposed work or, for grading, the
volume of earth to be handled.



   6.   Give such other information as reasonably may be required by
the building official.



   107.4 Issuance. The building official shall issue a permit to the
applicant for the work described in the application and plans filed therewith
when the building official is satisfied that all of the following items
comply:



   1.   The work described conforms to the requirements of this Code,
relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.



   2.   The fees specified by resolution or ordinance have been paid.



   3.   The applicant has obtained a permit pursuant to Public
Resources Code Section 30600 et seq, if such a permit is required.



   When the building official issues the permit, the building official
shall endorse in writing or stamp on both sets of plans “REVIEWED FOR
SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE ONLY.” Such stamped plans shall not be changed,
modified or altered without authorization from the building official, and all
work shall be done in accordance with the currently adopted Codes in effect
at the time of permit issuance regardless of the information presented on the
plans. The approval of the plans shall not be held to permit or to be an
approval of any violation of any Federal, State, County or City laws or
ordinances. The issuance of a permit shall not be deemed to certify that the
site of the described work is safe.



   One set of approved plans shall be returned to the applicant to be kept
on such building or work site at all times while the authorized work is in
progress.



   The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part
of a building or structure before the entire plans and calculations for the
whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided
adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with
all pertinent requirements of this Code. The holder of such permit shall
proceed at his or her own risk without assurance that the permit for the
entire building or structure will be granted.



   107.5 Permit Validity. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval
of plans and calculations shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an
approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this Code, relevant
laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. No permit presuming to give
authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code, relevant laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations shall be valid, except insofar as the work
or use which it authorizes is lawful.



   The issuance of a permit based on plans and calculations shall not
prevent the building official from thereafter requiring the correction of
errors in said plans and calculations or from preventing building operations
being carried on there under when in violation of this Code, relevant laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations.



   107.6 Expiration of Permit. Every permit issued by the building
official under the provisions of this Code shall expire automatically by
limitation and become null and void one year after the date of the last
required building inspection approval by the building official or if work
authorized by such permit is not commenced within one year from the issuance
date of such permit. Before such work can be commenced or recommenced, a new
permit shall be first obtained.



   For the purposes of this paragraph, “required building inspection”
shall mean those inspections listed in Section 117.4.2, and those inspections
specifically identified on the Job Record issued with the building permit. No
partial inspection shall meet the definition of “required building
inspection.” Supplementary permits for electrical, grading, mechanical,
plumbing, and reroof shall not expire so long as the associated building
permit remains active. No electrical, grading, mechanical, plumbing or reroof
inspection shall satisfy the requirement to have a required building
inspection as defined in this Section.



   Where a new building permit is issued to complete work previously
started under an expired permit, a permit fee and or plan review fee shall be
collected in an amount determined by the Building Official, not to exceed 25
percent of the permit fee provided;



   1)   Applicant request in writing prior the effective date of a more
current code



   2)   that the duration of time from the date of expiration has not
exceeded one year



   3)   that no changes have been made or will be made in the original
plans and calculations for such work;



   Applicable Plan review fees and Permit fees, in addition to issuance
fees, for the remaining work based on the remaining work valuation shall be
collected for all permits which do not meet the preceding criteria.



   All work to be performed under the new permit must be done in
accordance with the Building Code in effect on the date of issuance of the
new permit.



   107.7 Permit Suspension or Revocation. The building official may, in
writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this Code,
relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations whenever the permit was
issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in
violation of any other laws, ordinances or regulations or any of the
provisions of this Code.



   The building official may also, in writing, withhold inspections,
suspend or revoke a permit where work is being done in violation of this
Code, where work is being done in violation of the approved plans, where work
is being concealed without approval from the building official or where work
is not in accordance with the direction of the building official.



   107.8 Cancellation of Permit by Applicant. If no portion of the work or
construction covered by a permit issued by the building official under the
provisions of this Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations has
been commenced, the person to whom such permit has been issued may deliver
such permit to the building official with a request that such permit be
cancelled. Only the person to whom such permit was issued may request
cancellation of the permit. The building official shall thereupon stamp or
write on the face of such permit the words, “Cancelled at the request of
the applicant.” Thereupon such permit shall be null and void and of no
effect. All fees except for issuance fees shall be returned to the applicant.



   107.9 Transfer of Permit by Applicant.



      107.9.1 No Inspection Performed. When requested in writing by the
person to whom the permit was issued, a permit may be transferred from the
person to whom the permit was issued to a new individual. Fee credit shall be
given where deemed appropriate by the building official and new fees shall be
paid as required by ordinance or resolution.



      107.9.2 One or More Inspection Performed. Permits may be
transferred to any individual upon completion of a new application. Fee
credit shall be given where deemed appropriate by the building official and
new fees shall be paid as required by ordinance or resolution.



      107.9.3 Permit Duration Remains Unchanged. Transfer of a permit
shall be considered a continuation of the previous permit when determining
the permit’s duration, and shall in no way extend the duration of the
preceding, permit.



   108 - RESERVED



   109 - USE AND OCCUPANCY



   109.1 General. No building, structure or premises, or portion thereof,
shall be used or occupied, and no change in the existing occupancy
classification of a building, structure or premises, or portion thereof,
shall be made until the building official has approved the building,
structure or premises or portion thereof for such use or occupancy and until
all permits have been approved or a temporary certificate of completed
construction has been issued.



   Upon final of a building permit and at the request of the applicant, a
certificate of completed construction shall be issued by the building
official for any structure which is ready to occupy.



   Approval of a building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, for
use or occupancy (including, but not limited to, final inspection approval
and/or issuance of a certificate of completed construction or issuance of a
temporary certificate of completed construction) shall not be construed as
approval of a violation of the provisions of this Code, relevant laws,
ordinances, rules and/or regulations. Approvals presuming to give authority
to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code, relevant laws, ordinances,
rules and/or regulations are not valid.



   The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke any such
approvals or certificates whenever the building official determines that the
approval or certificate was issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect
information supplied, or when it is determined that the building, structure
or premises, or portion thereof, is in violation of any provision of this
Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and/or regulations. Any certificate of
completed construction or temporary certificate of completed construction so
issued shall be surrendered upon request of the building official.



   109.2 Unpermitted Structures. No person shall own, use, occupy or
maintain any unpermitted structure.



   109.3 Change in Use. Changes in the character or use of a building
shall not be made except as specified in Existing Building Code.



   109.4 Issuance of a Certificate of Completed Construction. When the
building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, has passed final
inspection, and when the building, structure or premises complies with this
Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, and the required fees
have been paid, the building official, upon request of the applicant, shall
issue a certificate of completed construction which shall contain the
following:



   1.   The building permit number.



   2.   The address of the building or structure.



   3.   A description of that portion of the building for which the
certificate is issued.



   4.   A statement that the described portion of the building was
inspected and found to comply with the requirements of this Code, relevant
laws, ordinances, rules and regulations for the group and division of
occupancy and the use for which the proposed occupancy is classified.



   5.   The date the permit was approved.



   6.   Any other information deemed necessary by the building
official. For additional provisions applicable to grading, see Appendix J.



   109.5 Issuance of a Temporary Certificate of Completed Construction. If
the building official finds that no substantial hazard will result from
occupancy of any building or portion thereof before the same is completed,
the building official may issue a temporary certificate of completed
construction for the use of a portion or portions of a building, structure or
premises, prior to the completion of the entire building, structure or
premises, or portion thereof.



   Such temporary certificate of completed construction shall be valid for
a period of time to be specified by the building official. Upon request of
the owner or permittee the building official may, in writing, extend the
temporary certificate of completed construction when it is determined that
the circumstances so warrant. After the expiration of a temporary certificate
of completed construction and any extension(s) thereof, the building,
structure or premises, or portion thereof, shall not be used or occupied
until the building official has approved the building for such use or
occupancy.



   109.6. Live Load posted. In new construction, a durable sign that
indicates the “live load” shall be required in commercial or industrial
buildings where the floor or roof or portion thereof is or has been designed
with a live load that exceeds 50 psf. The live load sign shall be posted on
that part of each story or roof to which it applies, in a conspicuous place.
The live load sign shall be posted as a condition precedent to the issuance
of a certificate of completed construction certificate. It shall be unlawful
to remove or deface any such sign.



   109.7 Continued Use of Unpermitted and/or Noncomplying Conditions. When
deemed appropriate by the building official, a certificate of continued use
of unpermitted and/or noncomplying condition(s) may be issued. Building
Official shall have the authority to condition such continued use. The
certificate shall not be issued until documentation, satisfactory to the
building official, has been provided indicating that 1) the unpermitted
and/or noncomplying condition(s) were not created by the current owner, and
2) that the current owner had no knowledge that the conditions were
unpermitted and/or noncomplying at the time of purchase.



   An application shall be completed which states 1) that the continued
use of the existing unpermitted construction and or noncomplying conditions
is permitted by the City only with the owner’s understanding that the City
in no way assumes responsibility for the method of construction or the
materials used; and 2) that it is further understood that this application
for continued use is not to be construed as being equivalent in any way to a
building permit.



   An inspection shall then be made by the building official. Where
necessary, permits shall be issued to correct any conditions deemed to pose a
potential threat to life, limb or property. Once the inspection(s) have been
made; all necessary permits have been obtained, inspected and approved; and
all obvious potential threats to life, limb or property have been corrected,
the building official may approve the application for unpermitted
construction and or noncomplying condition(s). When approved by the building
official, conditions deemed not to pose an potential threat to life, limb or
property may be permitted to remain.



   110 - PROHIBITED USES OF BUILDING SITES



   110.1 Flood Hazard. Buildings are not permitted in an area determined
by the Building Official to be subject to flood hazard by reason of
inundation, overflow or erosion.



   The placement of the building and other structures (including walls and
fences) on the building site shall be such that water or mud flow will not be
a hazard to the building or adjacent property. This prohibition shall not
apply when provision is made to eliminate such hazard to the satisfaction of
the Building Official by providing adequate drainage facilities by protective
walls, suitable fill, raising the floor level of the building, a combination
of these methods, or by other means. The Building Official, in the
application of this Section for buildings, structures, and grading located in
whole or in part in flood hazard areas, shall enforce, as a minimum, the
current Federal Flood Plain Management Regulations defined in Title 44, Code
of Federal Regulations, Section 60.3, and may require the applicant or
property owner to provide the following information and/or comply with the
following provisions:



   1.   Delineation of flood hazard areas, floodway boundaries and
flood zones, and the design flood elevation, as appropriate;



   2.   The elevation of the proposed lowest floor, including basement,
in flood hazard areas (A Zones), and the height of the proposed lowest floor,
including basement, above the highest adjacent grade;



   3.   The elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural
member in coastal high hazard areas (V Zone);



   4.   If the design flood elevations are not included on the
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), then the applicant shall
obtain and reasonably utilize any design flood elevation and floodway data
available from other sources, as approved by the Building Official; and



   5.   During construction, upon placement of the lowest floor,
including basement, and prior to further vertical construction, the permittee
shall provide to the Building Official documentation, prepared and sealed by
a registered design professional, certifying the elevation of the lowest
floor, including basement.



   110.2 Geotechnical Hazards.



      110.2.1 No building or grading permit shall be issued under the
provisions of this section when the Building Official finds that property
outside the site of the proposed work could be damaged by activation or
acceleration of a geotechnically hazardous condition and such activation or
acceleration could be attributed to the proposed work on, or change in use
of, the site for which the permit is requested. For the purpose of this
section, a geotechnically hazardous condition does not include surface
displacement due to earthquake faults.



      110.2.2 Except as provided in Section 110.2.3, work requiring a
building or grading permit by this Code is not permitted in an area
determined by the Building Official to be subject to hazard from landslide,
settlement, or slippage. For the purpose of this Section, landslide,
settlement, or slippage does not include surface displacement due to the
earthquake faults.

   112 - EARTHQUAKE FAULT MAPS



   Earthquake fault zone maps within the City prepared under Sections 2622
and 2623 of the California Resources Code which show traces of earthquake
faults are hereby declared to be, on the date of official issue, a part of
this Code, and may be referred to elsewhere in this Code. Earthquake fault
zone maps revised under the above sections of the California Resources Code
shall, on the date of their official issue, supersede previously issued maps
which they replace.



   SECTION 113 - EARTHQUAKE FAULTS



   113.1 General. The construction of a building or structure near a known
active earthquake fault and regulated by this Code shall be permitted as set
forth in this Section.



   113.2 Scope. The provisions of this Section shall apply only to permits
for buildings or structures on individual lots or parcels and are not
intended to be supplementary to geologic investigations required to qualify
divisions of land as set forth in Title 22 (Subdivisions) of the City of
Alhambra Municipal Code.



   113.3 Definition. For the purpose of this Section, a geologist shall be
a professional geologist, licensed by the California State Board for
Geologists and Geophysicists to practice geology in California.



   113.4 Known Active Earthquake Faults. For the purpose of this Section,
known active earthquake faults are those faults which have had displacement
within Holocene time (approximately the last 11,000 years) as defined in the
most current issue of Special Publication 42 of the California Geological
Survey.



   113.5 Construction Limitations. No building or structure shall be
constructed over or upon the trace of a known active earthquake fault which
is shown on maps maintained by the Building Official. These maps include, but
are not limited to, earthquake fault zone maps prepared under Sections 2622
and 2623 of the California Public Resources Code.



   The absence of a known active earthquake fault trace at the proposed
building location shall be determined by a professional geologist licensed in
the State of California in the following cases:



   1.   When the proposed building is within (50) feet (15.24 m) of
that line designated by the Building Official as the assumed location of a
known active earthquake fault on the aforementioned maps.



   2.   When the proposed building is within 50 feet (15.24 m) of the
most probable ground location of the trace of a known active earthquake fault
shown on the aforementioned maps.



   In these cases the Building Official may require the excavation of a
trench, for the purpose of determining the existence of an active earthquake
fault. Such a trench will be required if a lack of distinguishable fault
features in the vicinity prevents the Building Official from determining by a
site examination, review of available aerial photographs, or by other means
that the fault trace does not underlie the proposed building. The trench
shall be approximately perpendicular to the most probable direction of the
fault trace, at least 1-1/2 feet (0.15 m) wide, and at least five feet in
depth measured from natural grade, or to a depth satisfactory to the Building
Official.



   The trench must be accessible for mapping and inspection by the
Building Official, when requested, and meet the requirements of Title 8 of
the California Code of Regulations, Construction Safety Orders. The trench
need not extend further than the full width of the proposed structure plus 5
feet (1.52 m) beyond the traversed exterior walls. A known active earthquake
fault shall be presumed nonexistent if an exposure is not found by the
professional geologist in the walls or floor of the trench.



   The Building Official may require a more extensive investigation by a
professional geologist as evidence to the absence of a known active
earthquake fault prior to the issuance of a permit for Groups A, E, I, H and
R, Division 1 Occupancies and B, F, M and S Occupancies over one story in
height.



   The results of the investigation, conclusions and recommendations shall
be presented in a geology report prepared by a professional geologist as
defined by Section 113.3. The report shall comply with the guidelines
presented in Note 49 prepared by the California Department of Conservation,
Geological Survey.



      EXCEPTION: The provisions of this Section do not apply to:



      1.   One-story, detached light-frame buildings not intended or
used for human occupancy and not exceeding 1,000 square feet (92.9 m2) in
gross floor area or 12 feet (3.66 m) in building height.



      2.   Alterations or repairs to an existing building provided
that the aggregate value of such work within any 12-month period does not
exceed 50 percent of the current market value of the existing building. For
the purposes of this Section 113.5, “alteration” does not include an
addition or additions.



      3.   Swimming pools, retaining walls, fences and minor work of
a similar nature.



   114 - FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING

   115.1 Plan review fees shall be as adopted by a separate resolution
and/or ordinance.



   Plan checking fees shall be paid at the time of plan review submittal.
In addition to the aforementioned fees, the building official may require
additional charges for review required by changes, additions or revisions of
approved plans or reports, and for services beyond the first and second check
due to changes, omissions or errors the part of the applicant.



   115.2 Permit fees shall be as adopted by separate resolution and/or
ordinance. Permit fees shall be paid at the time of permit issuance.



   115.3 The determination of value or valuation under any of the
provisions of this code shall be made by the building official. The valuation
to be used in computing the permit and plan check fees shall be the total
value of all construction work for which the permit is issued, as well as all
finish work, painting, roofing, electrical, plumbing, heating, air
conditioning, elevators, fire protection systems and any other permanent work

17 shall not relieve the permit applicant of the responsibility to have the
work inspected and approved by the building official.



   Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an
approval of a violation of any provision of this Code, relevant laws,
ordinances, rules or regulations. Inspections presuming to give authority to
violate or cancel the provisions of this Code, relevant laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations shall not be valid.



   It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to cause the work to
remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes. Neither the building
official nor the jurisdiction shall be liable for expense entailed in the
removal or replacement of any material required to allow inspection.



   It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to provide access for the
inspector to the area of work. Access may include, but shall not be limited
to, ladders, scaffolding, catwalks and lifts. It shall be the duty of the
permit applicant to maintain a safe access path for the inspector to the area
of work. Safety precautions may include, but shall not be limited to
handrails, guardrails and safety harnesses. All components of the access path
shall be securely anchored in place. The building inspector shall have the
right to refuse to make any inspection in an area which does not have an
access path deemed safe for use by said building inspector. It shall be the
duty of the permit applicant to make any necessary improvements to the access
path to allow inspection by the building inspector.



   It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to protect all existing

removal or replacement of any material(s) or work installed, constructed or
placed under the review of a special inspector who was not approved by the
building official.



      Failure to be approved by the building official prior to
performing any special inspection duties may be considered by the building
official as a failure to perform properly and shall allow the building
official to refuse to allow the special inspector to perform inspection
within the City.



      The special inspector shall observe the work assigned for
conformance with the approved design drawings. The special inspector shall
furnish inspection reports to the building official. All observed
discrepancies shall be brought to the immediate attention of the contractor
for correction, then if uncorrected, to the proper design authority and to
the building official.



      The special inspector shall submit a final signed report stating
that the work requiring special inspection was, to the best of the
inspector’s knowledge, in conformance with the approved plans and the
applicable workmanship provisions of this Code.



      The building official shall have the right to reject any work
performed under the review of a special inspector where the work performed
fails to meet the minimum requirements of this Code, relevant laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations. Regardless of the information communicated
between the permit applicant and the special inspector, all work shall comply
with the approved plans and this Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations.



      Upon evidence, satisfactory to the building official, of the
failure of a special inspector to perform properly and effectively the duties
of said office, the building official may revoke, suspend or refuse to allow
the special inspector to perform inspection on sites within the City. Prior
to such action, the holder shall be given an opportunity to appear before the
building official and be heard.



   117.6 Provisions for Structural Observation. When structural
observation is required in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 17,
the engineer or architect of record shall indicate on the plans what work is
required to be observed by the engineer or architect responsible for the
structural design, or the engineer or architect responsible for the
structural design shall prepare an inspection program and shall name the
individuals or firms who are to perform structural observation and describe
the stages of construction at which structural observation is to occur. The
inspection program shall include samples of inspection reports and provide
time limits for the submission of observation reports. The program shall be
submitted to and approved by the building official prior to building permit
issuance.



   When required by the engineer or architect responsible for the
structural design or the building official, the owner shall employ the
engineer or architect responsible for the structural design, or another
engineer or architect designated by the engineer or architect responsible for
the structural design to perform structural observation as defined in Section
202.



   When deemed appropriate by the engineer or architect responsible for
the structural design, the owner or owner’s representative shall coordinate
and call a preconstruction meeting between the engineer or architect
responsible for the structural design, the structural observer, the
contractor, the affected subcontractors and the special inspector(s). The
structural observer shall preside over the meeting. The purpose of the
meeting shall be to identify the major structural elements and connections
that affect the vertical and lateral load systems of the structure and to
review scheduling of the required observations. A record of the meeting shall
be submitted to the building official.



   All observed discrepancies shall be brought to the immediate attention
of the engineer or architect responsible for the structural design and the
contractor for correction; then if unresolved, to the building official. The
structural observer shall submit to the building official a written statement
at each significant construction stage stating that the required site visits
have been made and identifying any reported deficiencies which, to the best
of the structural observer’s knowledge, have not been resolved. The
structural observer shall submit a final signed report stating that the work
requiring structural observation was, to the best of the observer’s
knowledge, in conformance with the approved plans and the applicable
workmanship provisions of this Code.



   117.7 Required Approvals. No work shall be done on any part of the
building structure or premises beyond the point indicated in each successive
inspection without first obtaining the written approval of the building
official. The building official, upon notification, shall make the requested
inspections and shall either indicate in writing that the work appears to
comply as completed, or shall notify the applicant in writing which portion
of the work fails to comply with this Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules
and/or regulations. Any work which does not comply shall be corrected and
such work shall not be covered or concealed until authorized by the building
official.

any structure on which noninspected work has been performed.



   117.10 Utility Release. When deemed appropriate by the building
official, gas and electric utilities may be released. Release of either
utility may be done prior to building final for testing and inspection
purposes. The building official shall retain the right to revoke the release
of either utility for just cause, and may have either utility disconnected at
the earliest availability of the utility purveyor.



   Attempting to occupy prior to issuance of a certificate of completed
construction, whether temporary or final, may be considered as just cause by
the building official, and may result in disconnection of the utilities.



   117.11 Authority to Disconnect Electric Utility. The building official
is hereby empowered to disconnect or to order in writing the discontinuance
of electric utility service to buildings, structures or premises, or portions
thereof, or wiring, devices or materials installed without permit or found to

relevant laws, ordinances, rules or regulations.



   The electrical service shall remain disconnected or electrical utility
service shall remain discontinued until the Code violation has been abated to
the satisfaction of the building official, or until the installation of such
wiring, devices or materials have been made safe as directed by the building
official; or until a permit has been issued and the work has been inspected
and approved by the building official.



   117.12 Authority to Disconnect Gas Utility. The building official is

§ 21.04.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this title is to prohibit the drilling on the surface or
into the subsurface of oil and gas wells, the production of oil and gas and
the storing and transportation thereof in the city, except as may be provided
herein.



   (A)   The City Council hereby declares that it is also the object
and purpose of this title to establish reasonable and uniform limitations,
safeguards and controls for the drilling for and production of oil, gas and
other hydrocarbon substances within and under the city. Such limitations,
safeguards and controls are found to be necessary in order to protect the
citizens, their property rights and the general public of the city and to put
into effect practices which will provide a plan for the orderly drilling for
and production of oil and gas, which substances are important to the national
economy. Such orderly development is necessary and will protect the surface
uses and the value and character of residential, commercial and other real
property in the city as such uses are set forth in the zoning ordinances and
regulations of the city. The City Council recognizes that many of its
citizens and property owners have made substantial investments in real
property and do not own the mineral rights lying in or under such property
and will not profit directly from oil or gas development. Therefore, in order
to protect such citizens and their property rights, to protect the owners of
mineral rights and to provide for the orderly exploration, development and
production of oil and gas, it is necessary to regulate the drilling for and
production of oil and gas as set forth in this title.



   (B)   The City Council hereby finds and deter-mines that the
uncontrolled drilling on the surface or into the subsurface for oil and gas
and the production thereof in the city would be detrimental to the general
welfare of its citizens and residents, and detrimental to the general public
peace, health, safety, comfort, convenience and prosperity. The City Council
finds and determines that subsurface areas within the city may be explored
for oil and gas and, if the substances are found, the same may be produced by
directional or slant drilling methods from surface locations within the city,
all of which operations must be limited to certain controlled drilling sites
hereby established and created in this title. Such controlled drilling sites
and the limitations and regulations set forth herein are necessary in order
to protect the citizens and residents of the city from oil odors, noise,
dust, the spreading of oil, dirt and debris upon the public streets of the
city and to protect buildings and structures from vibration, sinking, or
other damage caused by the drilling for and production of oil and gas in an
unrestricted location and manner.

('86 Code, § 21.08.040) (Ord. 3115, passed  - - )



§ 21.08.050  GRANTING OR DENIAL OF PERMIT.



   After the conclusion of the public hearing, the City Council may take
such action as it deems proper. If the City Council grants the permit, it may
do so upon such terms and conditions as it deems proper, but no permit shall
be granted without the following standard conditions being required and made
a part or condition of such permit:



   (A)   Drilling operations for any well shall commence within 180
days from the effective date of the permit, unless such time is extended by
the City Council.



   (B)   All drilling shall be done by means of a steel derrick
enclosed with fireproofed and sound-proofed material, and operations shall be
carried on diligently from the commencement of the drilling until the
completion of the well, or until such well is abandoned.



   (C)   Within 90 days after the completion of drilling operations or
abandonment of further drilling, the derrick and all drilling equipment,
including temporary tanks, shall be removed from the drill site. No permanent
derrick shall be installed or maintained on any controlled drilling site or
used for the drilling or production of any oil or gas well.



   (D)   During the temporary testing period following the completion
of any well, which period shall not exceed 60 days, internal combustion
engines may be used to power pumping units. All internal combustion engines
shall be equipped with such types of mufflers as may be satisfactory to the
City Council. Thereafter, all pumping equipment shall be operated by electric
motors.



   (E)   No person shall use any open sump or reservoir within the city
for the purpose of storing, holding or handling oil or liquid hydrocarbons,
rotary mud, drill cuttings and oilfield wastes, derived or resulting from or
connected with the drilling, produc-tion, use, operation or maintenance of
any oil and gas well. All of the substances and similar products shall be
collected, and stored in steel tanks or other closed receptors as may be
required in any permit and which shall not extend more than five feet above
ground level. Tanks for waste materials, drill cutting, rotary mud and waste
materials shall be removed from the controlled drilling site upon completion
of drilling operations. Mud and cuttings, while being circulated, shaken or
recirculated, in connection with the drilling temporary geological
exploratory core holes, need not be kept in closed receptors.



   (F)   Applicants shall comply with all the provisions of this code,
ordinances, rules and regulations of the city and all laws of the state with
respect to disposal of waste materials and air pollution.



   (G)   All drilling and production equipment installed or operated
upon any controlled drilling site shall be so constructed, operated, and
maintained that no noise, vibration, odor or other harmful or annoying
substances or effect therefrom which can be eliminated or diminished by the
use of modern and approved types of equipment and silencers shall ever be
permitted to result from operations on any controlled drilling site to the
injury or annoyance of persons in the vicinity of such controlled drilling
site. Proven technological and mechanical improvements in methods of drilling
and production, and in the type of equipment used therefor shall be adopted
from time to time as the same become available, if the use of such equipment,
improvements, and methods will reduce noise, vibration, odors, or the harmful
effects of annoying substances. The use of equipment in any controlled
drilling site which causes noise or vibra-tion, shall at all times be subject
to the approval of the City Council, and the City Council may amend any
permit and require the permittee to abate any noise or vibration which
constitutes a nuisance and is detrimental to the citizens in the vicinity
where such equipment is being operated.



   (H)   During all drilling or production operations, except in the
case of emergency, all equipment or supplies to be delivered to the drill
site shall be transported, trucked or conveyed to the drilling site and
unloaded only between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. During the testing of
any well, which shall not exceed a period of 60 days after the completion
thereof, oil may be trucked from the drilling site, provided such trucking is
done between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. As soon as commercial production
has been established in any new well, acquisition of a right-of-way or the
construction of a pipeline shall be started within 60 days and work thereon
diligently prosecuted until such pipeline is completed in order to eliminate
the trucking of oil. All oil and gas shall be shipped and transported through
pipelines when completed. All pipelines outside of the drill site shall be
laid to a depth of at least three feet below the surface of the ground where
existing structures permit.



   (I)   Private roads for ingress and egress to and from the drill
site shall be surfaced with gravel, oiled and maintained in good condition at
all times during drilling and production operations. No signs shall be
erected on the drill site except those required by law or permitted by this
code, or any ordinances or regulations of this city.



   (J)   Well abandonment shall be in accordance with requirements of
the state division of oil and gas. Upon such abandonment applicant shall
restore the property as nearly as possible to its original condition, and
shall remove all concrete foundations, oil soaked soil and debris, all holes
or depressions shall be filled to the natural surface.



   (K)   When required by the City Council, the applicant or permittee
shall designate a competent representative who shall be responsible for the
supervision of drilling operations and the carrying out of the conditions of
any permit. Such representative shall be available at all times during
drilling operations and shall be the responsible contact agent of applicant
or the permittee whom the City Council may require to carry out the
provisions of the permit.



   (L)   After any oil or gas well has been placed on production, the
site thereof shall be adequately landscaped and screened, either with
shrubbery, masonry or concrete wall, or their equal, so that the same shall
not be unsightly nor hazardous. After any oil and gas well is placed on
production, all equip-ment with moving parts in use at such well shall be
securely enclosed by an adequate type of fence or approved wire screen or
housing, sufficient to prevent the entry of persons thereto. Such protections
shall be subject to the approval of the Superintendent of Building of this
city. Any gates thereto shall be securely fastened at all times, except when
authorized personnel are in attendance at such well. All tanks and other
equipment shall be depressed so that the top of any tank or other equipment
or appurtenances shall not extend more than five feet above the surface of
the site, unless otherwise permitted by the City Council. Any wall around
storage tanks shall be painted a neutral color to blend with the
surroundings. Tanks holding liquid hydrocarbons shall have an enclosing dike
to confine contents in the event of an accidentally ruptured tank. Such dikes
shall be constructed of earth or concrete.



   (M)   Oil produced from the wells may be stored in steel tanks on
the site. Unless otherwise permitted by the City Council, the total amount of
storage for production, recycling and all storage and operational purposes
shall not exceed two tanks each of 1,000 barrels capacity.



   (N)   All of the operations at the drill site shall be conducted in
a careful and orderly manner, and the premises shall at all times be
maintained in a neat, clean and orderly condition.



   (O)   Within 60 days after any oil and gas well is placed on
production, the applicant or permittee shall file with the City Clerk a copy
of the complete record of any oil and gas well, which record shall be the
same as that filed with the division of oil and gas of the state. The City
Council may require a map or plat showing the location of the producing
interval and the route of the well hole between the production interval and
the controlled drilling site shall be furnished to the city. All records
submitted pursuant to this division shall be confidential and privileged.



   (P)   All fire fighting equipment as required and approved by the
Chief of the Fire Department shall be installed and maintained on the
controlled drilling site at all times during the drilling and production
operations.



   (Q)   All well holes and oil and gas wells passing through, or
bottomed in or under residential real property in the city, which wells are
drilled from controlled drilling sites outside the city shall be below a
depth of 500 feet upon entering real property within the city. All oil and
gas wells or well holes drilled from a controlled drilling site within the
city shall be at least 500 feet below the surface of the controlled drilling
site when such well hole or well leaves or goes outside the boundaries of the
controlled drilling site.



   (R)   The Superintendent of Building shall have the primary
responsibility of enforcement of the provisions of this title. When
appropriate, he shall consult with other city departments. Any and all
interested city officials shall be permitted at all reasonable times to
review and inspect the controlled drilling site and any operations or methods
used in the drilling for and producing of oil and gas.



   (S)   The City Council may restrict the use of certain streets,
alleys or roadways in connection with the permittee's operations which shall
be named in any permit granted. In the event any street, alley or road is
damaged by permittee's operations, then such damage shall be paid by the
permittee upon demand by the city and the failure to pay such damage, being
the reasonable cost of the repair of any such damaged portions, shall be
ground for the revocation of the permit or the collection of such damage at
law by the city.



   (T)   The permit shall become null and void unless accepted by the
applicant in its entirety in writing, filed with the City Clerk within 30
days from the date of the permit, and no work on the drill site shall be
commenced until such permit is accepted.



   (U)   The operation of any oil and gas well and production therefrom
drilled pursuant to a permit shall be in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the state division of oil and gas or any successor agent or
body thereto.

   (A)   The Planning Commission is authorized to consult with the
applicant in determining the boundaries of the proposed exploratory area.
Such area shall include an area in the city which can reasonably be expected
to produce oil or gas, or in or under which real property there are likely to
be deposits of oil and gas which can be produced. The exploratory area shall
be delineated and described in any permit issued hereunder.



   (B)   In order to determine the proper boundaries of any proposed
exploratory area, the Planning Commission or the City Council may employ such
engineers or consultants as it deems necessary to advise the Planning
Commission or the City Council in such matter, and the cost of such services
shall be paid by the city.

§ 21.08.070  AREA LEASING REQUIREMENTS.



   Each applicant requesting a permit must have the contractual or
proprietary right and authority to drill for oil and gas under the surface of
at least 51% of the area of the real property described and included in any
proposed exploratory area. The City Council or the Planning Commission may
require the applicant to prove any such authority by submitting a lease
agreement or evidence of ownership therefor.



('86 Code, § 21.08.070) (Ord. 3115, passed  - - )



§ 21.08.080  POOLING OF PROPERTY.



   It being the intention of the City Council to give the owners of oil
and gas rights within the exploratory area the right and privilege to
participate in royalties derived from the drilling of wells in the
exploratory area, it shall be a condition to the granting of any permit by
the City Council that each applicant or permittee or his successor in
interest, shall, within one year from the issuance of a permit under the
provisions of this title, execute an offer in writing giving to each record
owner of property located within the exploratory area who has not joined in
the lease, or other authorization to drill, the right to share in the
proceeds of production from wells bottomed in the district, upon the same
basis as those property owners who have, by lease or other legal consent,
agreed to the drilling for and produc-tion of oil, gas or other hydrocarbon
substances from the subsurface of 51% of the area. The offer hereby required
must remain open for acceptance for a period of five years after the date of
issuance of the permit. During the period the offer is in effect, the
applicant, or his successor in interest, shall impound all royalties to which
the owners or any of them may become entitled in a bank or trust company in
the state, with proper provisions for payment to the record owners of
property in the exploratory area who had not signed the lease at the time
such permit was issued, but who accept such offer in writing within the five
year period. Any such royalties remaining in any bank or trust company at the
time the offer expires and which are not due or payable as hereinabove
provided shall be paid pro rata to those owners who, at the time of such
expiration, are otherwise entitled to share in the proceeds of such
production.

together with any recommendations for approval, or conditional approval, of

5-14-18)



§ 22.08.060  DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT.



   (A)   The Director of Community Development shall be responsible for
the processing of all tentative land division or reversion to acreage maps,
for processing requests for merger/unmerger of parcels and for the collection
of all required fees and deposits. In addition, he or she shall act as
chairperson for the Development Review Committee.



   (B)   Specifically, the Director of Community Development shall be
responsible for:



      (1)   Investigating proposed subdivisions for conformity to
the General Plan, specific plans, and zoning ordinance of the city and
reporting his or her findings, together with recommendations for approval,
conditional approval or denial to the Planning Commission;



   (C)   Certifying, as Secretary of the Planning Commission, that the

5-14-18)



§ 22.08.070  SIMULTANEOUS CONSIDERATION OF DISCRETIONARY ENTITLEMENTS.



   (A)   Where any project requires consideration of multiple
discretionary entitlements and the applicant wishes such applications to be
considered simultaneously, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Municipal Code, all consideration of such entitlements shall be for purposes
of generating a recommendation until the entitlements are elevated to the
most senior approving authority required for any one of the entitlements,
which authority shall have the final approval for all entitlements (unless an
appeal remains to higher approving authorities). Thus, by way of illustration
only, an application for a project involving a zone change, a tentative map
and Design Review Board design approval would be considered by both the
Design Review Board and the Planning Commission for purposes of making a
recommendation to the City Council. If the City Council were then to approve
the zone change, the City Council would also have the authority, in this
limited circumstance, to approve the final design, as well as the tentative
map. Any subsequent amendment or modification of any particular discretionary
entitlement that would not normally be considered by a more senior approving
authority would be considered by the more junior approving authority, as
otherwise provided for in this code. Thus, in the example herein, a
subsequent modification of the tentative map could be considered and approved
by the Planning Commission, without further consideration by the City Council
(absent an appeal).



   (B)   For purposes of this section “discretionary entitlement”
does not include non-discretionary entitlements such as building permits,
zone clearances and grading permits. If the Director of Community Development
is unclear as to whether an entitlement is discretionary or non-discretionary
in this context, the Director may include such entitlement with other
discretionary entitlements to be considered.

§ 22.20.060  DISTRIBUTION OF TENTATIVE MAPS.



   (A)   The Department of Community Development shall forward copies
of the tentative map to the following agencies which may, in turn, forward to
the Director of Community Development, their findings and recommendations.
Public agencies and utilities shall certify that the subdivision can be
adequately served. These agencies include: City Department of Public Works,
City Police Department, City Fire Department, City Community Development
Department, local school district, and other affected agencies or property
owners as deemed necessary by the Director of Community Development.



   (B)   Within ten days of the filing of a tentative map, the
Community Development Department shall send notice of the filing of the
tentative map to the governing board of any elementary, high school or
unified school district within the boundaries of which the subdivision is
proposed to be located. The notice shall also contain information about the
location of the proposed subdivision, the number of units, density, and any
other information which would be relevant to the affected school district.
The Governing Board may review the notice and may send a written report to
the agency required by law to approve the tentative map. The report shall
indicate the impact of the proposed subdivision on the affected school
district and shall make recommendations as the Governing Board of the
district deems appropriate. In the event the school district fails to respond
within a 15 working day period from receipt of notice of the tentative map,
the failure shall be deemed approval of the proposed subdivision by the
school district. The Planning Commission shall consider the report from the
school district in approving, conditionally approving or denying the
tentative map.



   (C)   Cal. Gov't Code § 66453 provides that a local agency may make
recommendations concerning proposed subdivisions to any adjoining city or
adjoining unincorporated area within three miles of the local agency. That
section of the Map Act provides that a local agency which desires to make
recommendations, shall file with the adjoining agency a map indicating the
territory which it desires to make the recommendations. When the city
receives such a territorial map, it shall thereafter transmit to the agency
one copy of each tentative map of sub-divisions located wholly or partially
within the territory outlined on the map. The agency must respond within 15
days of receipt of the tentative map. The recommendations of the agency shall
be taken into consideration before action is taken on the tentative map. The
changes shown on the draft should be incorporated to reflect these
requirements.

   The Planning Commission shall render approval, conditional approval, or
disapproval of a tentative map of a subdivision within 50 days after a
complete application for such map has been filed. If an environmental impact
report is prepared for the tentative map, the 50-day period specified above
shall not be applicable and the Planning Commission shall render its decision
within 45 days after certification of the environmental impact report. The
decision of the Planning Commission may be recorded in the form of a
resolution. If a resolution is prepared it shall contain the facts and
reasons upon which the decision was based, and include the finding that the
division is or is not consistent with the city general plan, or any
applicable specific plans, or other applicable ordinances or policies. Time
limits specified herein shall be modified only to the extent provided for in
the Map Act.



('86 Code, § 22.20.090) (Ord. 4120, passed  - - )



§ 22.20.100  APPROVAL.



   In determining whether to approve or disapprove an application for a
tentative map, the Planning Commission shall apply only those ordinances,
policies and standards in effect at the date the Director of Community
Development has determined that the application is complete, pursuant to Cal.
Gov't Code § 65943, except in the following instances:



   (A)   The city has initiated proceedings to modify land use
regulations by way of ordinance, resolution or motion.



   (B)   The city has published legal notice containing a description
sufficient to notify the public of the nature of the proposed change in the
applicable general or specific plans, and zoning or subdivision ordinances.



   (C)   Whenever the city has performed both (A) and (B), it may apply
any ordinances, policies or standards enacted or instituted as a result of
those proceedings which are in effect on the date the Planning Commission
approves or disapproves the tentative map.



      (1)   If the applicant requests changes in applicable
ordinances, policies or standards in connection with the same development
project, any ordinances, policies or standards adopted pursuant to the
applicant's request shall apply.



      (2)   The Planning Commission (or on appeal, the City Council)
may modify or delete any of the conditions of approval recommended in the
Community Development Department's report, except conditions required by city
ordinance or by the City Engineer related to public health and safety or to
standards approved by the City Engineer. The Planning Commission and City
Council may add additional requirements as a condition of their approval.

§ 22.20.110  DENIAL.



   (A)   The tentative map may be denied by the Planning Commission (or
on appeal, may be denied by the City Council) on any of the grounds provided
by city ordinances or the Subdivision Map Act.



   (B)   The Planning Commission and/or City Council shall deny
approval of the tentative map if it makes any of the following findings:



      (1)   That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable
general and specific plans;



      (2)   That the design or improvement of the proposed
subdivision is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans;



      (3)   That the site is not physically suitable for the type of
development;



      (4)   That the site is not physically suitable for the
proposed density of development;



      (5)   That the design of the subdivision or the proposed
improvements are likely to cause sub-stantial environmental damage or
substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat.
However, if an environmental impact report was prepared for the project and a
finding was made pursuant to Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21081(a)(3) and (b) that
specific economic, social and other considerations make infeasible the
mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the environmental
impact report then the Planning Commission may still approve the tentative
map;



      (6)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of
improvements is likely to cause serious public health problems;



      (7)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of
improvements will conflict with ease-ments, acquired by the public at large,
for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision. In
this connection, the governing body may approve a map if it finds that
alternate easements for access or for use will be provided, and that these
will be substantially equivalent to easements previously acquired by the
public. This division shall apply only to easements of record and to
easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. No
authority is hereby granted to a legislative body to determine that the
public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property
within the proposed subdivision.

overcrossings, streets, inter-changes, flood control or storm drain
facilities, sewer facilities, water facilities and lighting facilities.



      (2)   A tentative map on property subject to a development
agreement with the city or redevelop-ment agency may be extended for the
period of time provided for in the agreement, but not beyond the duration of
the agreement.



   (B)   The time periods specified in (A) above shall not include any
period of time during which a development moratorium or lawsuit affecting the

recommendations, shall file with the adjoining agency a map indicating the
territory in which it desires to make the recommendations. When the city
receives such a territorial map, it shall thereafter transmit to the agency
one copy of each tentative map of subdivisions located wholly or partially
within the territory outlined on the map. The agency must respond within 15
days of receipt of the tentative map. The recommendations of the agency shall
be taken into consideration before action is taken on the tentative map. The

   At the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall hear all the
evidence and recommendations, and shall approve, conditionally approve or
disapprove the tentative parcel map within 50 days of the filing thereof, a

the Planning Commission may be recorded in the form of a resolution. If a
resolution is prepared it shall contain the facts and reasons upon which the
decision was based, and include the finding that the division is or is not
consistent with the City General Plan, or any applicable specific plans, or
other applicable ordinances or policies. The Secretary of the Planning
Commission shall thereafter report the Commission's decision in writing to
the applicant within ten days of the action. Such action by the Planning

§ 22.24.090  APPROVAL.



   (A)   In determining whether to approve or disapprove an application
for a tentative map, the Planning Commission shall apply only those
ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the date the Director of
Community Development has determined that the application is complete,
pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 65943, except in the following instances:



      (1)   The city has initiated proceedings to modify land use
regulations by way of ordinance, resolution or motion.



      (2)   The city has published legal notice containing a
description sufficient to notify the public of the nature of the proposed
change in the applicable general or specific plans, and zoning or subdivision
ordinances.



      (3)   Whenever the city has performed both (1) and (2), it may
apply any ordinances, policies or standards enacted or instituted as a result
of those proceedings which are in effect on the date the Planning Commission
approves or disapproves the tentative map.



   (B)   If the applicant requests changes in applic-able ordinances,
policies or standards in connection with the same development project, any
ordinances, policies or standards adopted pursuant to the applicant's request
shall apply.



   (C)   The Planning Commission (or on appeal, the City Council) may
modify or delete any of the conditions of approval recommended in the
Community Development Department's report, except conditions required by city
ordinance or by the City Engineer related to public health and safety or to
standards approved by the City Engineer. The Planning Commission and City
Council may add additional requirements as a condition of their approval.

§ 22.24.100  DENIAL.



   (A)   The tentative map may be denied by the Planning Commission on
any of the grounds provided by city ordinance or the Subdivision Map Act.



   (B)   The Planning Commission shall deny approval of the tentative
map if it makes any of the following findings:



      (1)   That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable
general and specific plans;



      (2)   That the design or improvement of the proposed
subdivision is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans;



      (3)   That the site is not physically suitable for the type of
development;



      (4)   That the site is not physically suitable for the
proposed density of development;



      (5)   That the design of the subdivision or the proposed
improvements are likely to cause sub-stantial environmental damage or
substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat.
However, if an environmental impact report was prepared for the project and a
finding was made pursuant to subdivision (c) of Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21081
that specific economic, social other con-siderations make infeasible the
mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the environmental
impact report, the Planning Commission may still approve the tentative map;



      (6)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of
improvements is likely to cause public health problems;



      (7)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of
improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large,
for access through or of, property within the proposed subdivision. In this
connection, the governing body may approve a map if it finds that alternate
easements for access or use will be provided, and that these will be
substantially equivalent to easements previously as acquired by the public.
This division shall apply only to easements of record or to easements
established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and no authority
is hereby granted to a legislative body to determine that the public at large
has acquired ease-ments for access through or use of property within the
proposed subdivision.

the Planning Commission with respect to the map or the kinds, nature, and
extent of the improvements and conditions imposed, he shall within ten days
after such action appeal in writing to the City Council for relief. The

§ 22.28.010  DEFINITION.



   A lot line adjustment pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 66412(d) of the
Subdivision Map Act where the land, in total, taken from one parcel and added
to an adjacent parcel, does not exceed 50% of the gross area of the parcel
from which it is taken and where the same number of parcels as originally
existed are the resultant.



('86 Code, § 22.28.010) (Ord. 4120, passed  - - )

   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, the
Planning Commission may approve lot line adjustments as defined in §

      (1)   Each parcel involved in the adjustment is one of the
following:



         (a)   A parcel approved under the procedures of this
title or any former ordinance regulating the design and improvement of
subdivision;



         (b)   All or any portion of a former utility or public
right-of-way.



      (2)   The Planning Commission finds:



         (a)   That because no significant change in access,
configuration or orientation of structures or utilities to lot lines is
proposed, the adjustment will not result in any significant burden on public
services or materially affect the property rights of any adjacent owners;



         (b)   That the parcels to be adjusted are eligible for
unconditional certificates of compliance under the provisions of the
Subdivision Map Act and this ordinance; and



         (c)   That the adjusted parcel configura-tions are in
accord with established neighborhood lot design patterns and not violative of
any statute, ordinance, regulation or good planning practice.



      (3)   If any of the parcels to be adjusted are improved with a
primary structure, the applicant shall provide evidence to the satisfaction
of the Director of Community Development that the changes in parcel lines not
violate a ordinances or regulations controlling such structures.



   (B)   The applicant for a lot line adjustment shall supply to the
city such completed forms and docu-mentation as the city deems necessary to
review and act upon the request. If the adjustment is approved, the applicant
shall cause to be filed for record certificates of compliance, containing the
descriptions of parcels as they will exist after adjustment pursuant to the
applicable provisions of this title and to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer.



   (C)   The applicant or any affected party may appeal the decision of
the Planning Commission on a lot line adjustment to the City Council. All
appeals shall be submitted and acted upon in the manner prescribed in §
22.24.110 of this title.



   (D)   The fees for a lot line adjustment shall be established in
accordance with Chapter 22.76.

Commission (or upon appeal, the City Council) may deny such a vesting
tentative map or may approve it, pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 66498.3, with
a condition that the subdivider obtain the necessary change in the zoning
ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If such a zone change is obtained,
the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall confer the
vested rights to proceed with development in substantial conformance with the
approved change in the zoning ordinance and map.



('86 Code, § 22.48.050) (Ord. 4120, passed  - - )



§ 22.48.060  TIME PERIOD TO EXERCISE VESTED RIGHTS.



   (A)   The rights conferred by an approved vesting tentative map
shall last for an initial time period of one year beyond the recording of the

recorded, the one-year initial period shall begin for each phase when the
final map for the phase is recorded.



   (B)   The initial time period shall be auto-matically extended if
the city fails to complete its review of an application for a grading permit
or for design or architectural review within 30 days from the date that a
complete application is received by the city.



   (C)   At any time prior to the expiration of the initial one year
time period, the subdivider may apply for a maximum, one year time extension,
to be con-sidered by the Planning Commission. If such request is denied, the
subdivider may appeal that denial to the City Council, within 15 days of the
action.



   (D)   If the subdivider submits a complete appli-cation for a
building permit within the initial one year period specified above, the
rights conferred by the vesting map shall continue until the expiration of

   The standards and requirements specified in this chapter shall apply to
all final maps. The require-ments applicable to a parcel map, parcel map
waiver, lot adjustment, conditional certificate of compliance and parcel
merger, shall be limited to the dedication rights-of-way, easements and the

being created.



('86 Code, § 22.52.010) (Ord. 4120, passed  - - )



§ 22.52.020  DESIGN STANDARDS.



   (A)   Streets and highways.  Street right-of-way alignment design
specifications shall conform to the standards set by the City Engineer, in
accordance with the adopted corridor studies, or other standards adopted by
the City Council. In the event that standards have not been adopted, the
Director of Public Works shall establish the minimum, which decision may be
appealed to the City Council.



   (B)   Alleys.  Alley alignment design specifica-tions shall conform
to the standards set by the City Engineer, in accordance with the adopted
studies, or other standards adopted by the City Council. In the event that
standards have not been adopted, the Director of Public Works shall establish
the minimum, which decision may be appealed to the City Council.



   (C)   Private ways.  Private ways may be approved only in those
areas where the topography has a side slope in excess of one foot vertical
rise for each four feet vertical rise for each four feet horizontal distance
(4:1 slope), and where the grade of the way, measured at its centerline, is
greater than 15%; and thus does not permit the development and dedication of
a street or roadway conforming with the design standards established herein.



      (1)   The City Council may approve such a private way as a
means of access only in those cases where it would be unreasonable to demand
a dedi-cated street, or where the failure to so approve would constitute a
denial of the use of property otherwise suitable and proper for development.



      (2)   A private way shall be not less than 30 feet in width,
measured on a line perpendicular to the centerline of the private way in a
horizontal plane, at the point where it intersects a public or private
street, shall not diminish in width at any point, shall not exceed 250 feet
in length, and shall have an adequate turning area at the end farthest from
an intersecting intercepting dedicated street.



      (3)   The private way shall be improved with a paved roadway
not less than 24 feet in width, or as otherwise approved by the City
Engineer, based upon the number of homesites utilizing the private way.



   (D)   Traffic-control and safety devices.  The subdivider shall
install all required traffic-control and safety devices, in accordance with
the standards and recommendations of the City Engineer.



   (E)   Blocks.  Blocks shall be two lots deep and not less than 200
feet in depth, measured from the frontage on one street to the frontage on
the closest parallel street. Where lots back up to a street or highway and
where it is intended that there shall be no access from the lot to the street
or highway against which they back, a five-foot high masonry wall shall be
erected in accordance with the standards of the City Engineer on the rear
property line as a physical separation between the lot and the street or
highway.



   (F)   Special blocks.  Plans for special blocks, called super
blocks, may be submitted to the Commission for approval when such blocks
propose special design features which will provide for greater amenities than
those set forth in the minimum standard provisions of this title and where no
hardship is wrought on the community as a whole by the approval of such super
block plans.



   (G)   Walkways.  The subdivider may be required to dedicate and
improve walkways to standards prescribed by the Commission across blocks
greater than 900 feet in length, in order to provide more convenient access
to school, park or other public areas.



   (H)   Lots.



      (1)   Minimum frontage and depth.  All lots shall have a
minimum frontage of 50 feet and a minimum depth of 130 feet and shall in all
ways conform to the standards established in Title 23 (Zoning ordinance ) of
this code.



      (2)   Minimum area; residential lots.  All residential lots
shall have a minimum area of 6,500 square feet. Easements over any such lot
for public utility purposes shall not be considered as a reduction from the
required lot area; provided, however, that the easements shall not cover more
than 1/6 of the total area of such lot.



      (3)   Minimum area; industrial lots.  All industrial lots
shall have a minimum area of 20,000 square feet.



      (4)   Determining block face to be considered frontage.  On
major traffic, collector and local streets, all lots shall front upon the
street that parallels the long dimension of the block. In the case of square
blocks, the Commission shall determine on the basis of the exiting uses which
block face shall be considered as frontage.



      (5)   Flag lots.  Flag lots are prohibited.



      (6)   Double frontage. Double frontage lots are prohibited.



      (7)   Side lot lines.  Side lot lines of rectangular lots
shall be as nearly perpendicular to the centerline of the street upon which
the lots front as is practical; side lot lines of lots fronting on curved
streets shall be as nearly radial as is practical. Except as follows: In
cases where more than 50% of the frontage on the same side of the street
between inter-secting streets is already subdivided into lots, which lots are
already built upon, the Commission may approve the predominant width of the
existing lots in this frontage as the minimum standard; provided, however,
that in no case shall the Commission approve the creation of any lot with an
average width less than 45 feet and with less than 33 feet of frontage on a
dedicated street.



      (8)   Corner lots shall be at least 10% wider than the minimum
requirements for interior lots in any zone, in order to maintain required
building lines for both side and front streets.

development is placed shall be considered unless there is a defined and
definite separation and change in land use.

days during which the improvement plan has been returned to the applicant for
correction, has been subject to review by agencies other than the city or,
following that review, has been returned to the applicant for correction.
These time limits may be extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the
City Engineer.



      (2)   The city may also contract with other private entities
or persons to review the improvement plans, if it determines that it is

subdivider a detailed statement of such costs. The subdivider shall pay all
such costs within 15 days after receipt of such detailed statement. The work
will not be accepted by the city until all such costs have been paid. The

§ 23.02.020  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The purpose of this title is to consolidate and coordinate all
existing zoning regulations and provisions into one comprehensive zoning plan
in order to designate, regulate and control the location and use of
buildings, structures and land for residence, commerce, trade and industry or
other purposes; to regulate and limit the height, number of stories and size
of buildings and other structures, hereafter erected or altered; to regulate
and determine the size of yards and other open spaces and to regu-late and
limit the density of population; and for said purposes to divide the city
into zones of such number, shape and area as may be deemed best suited to
carry out these regulations and to provide for the enforcement thereof.



   (B)   Further, such regulations are deemed necessary in order to
encourage the most appropriate use of land; to conserve and stabilize the
value of property; to provide adequate open spaces for light and air and to
prevent and fight fires; to prevent undue concentration of population; to
lessen conges-tion on streets; to facilitate adequate provisions for
community utilities and facilities such as transporta-tion, water, sewerage,
schools, parks and other public requirements; and to protect and promote the
health, safety and general welfare of the public, all in accordance with the
comprehensive zoning plan and in an orderly manner consistent with the goals
and policies of the City's General Plan.

follows:



 

Description
 
Maximum number of units per acre




All parcels with frontage only on Curtis or Electric Lanes and having no

*In the event of lot consolidations or subdivisions, the allowable unit
density may be increased if the changes result in additional frontage on any
other street and if there is no vehicular access to Curtis or Electric Lanes.









   (B)   For developments which include lots which are both within and
outside a 50 foot distance of Low or Medium Density properties, the
overall-density shall be computed as a blended density based upon the
applicable densities of the individual lots.



   (C)   In the case of multiple dwellings on a property, the number of
units shall be determined by counting:  The number of kitchens, or the
number of bedrooms divided by two.

§ 23.20.060  HOUSING DENSITY BONUSES.



   (A)   Density bonus requirements.



      (1)   Authority.  A density bonus shall be available,
consistent with the requirements of Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915 and sections
amendatory or supplementary thereto, as provided in full below.



         (a)   Any applicant for a density bonus shall make such
application, on a form approved by the Community Development Director, at the
time of submitting any entitlement application for the development for which
a density bonus is being requested.



         (b)   Any summaries of state law provided within this
section are only provided as general information.



         (c)   The state statute cited shall apply in full as it
exists at the time of application for a density bonus, and should therefore
be reviewed by any applicant.



      (2)   Incentives and concessions.  When an applicant seeks a
density bonus for a housing development within, or for the donation of land
for housing within the jurisdiction of the city, the city shall provide the
applicant incentives or concessions for the production of housing units and
child care facilities as prescribed in this section.



      (3)   Options for applicants.  The city shall grant one
density bonus, the amount of which shall be as specified in division (E), and
incentives or concessions as described in division (C), when an applicant for
a housing development seeks and agrees to construct a housing development,
excluding any units permitted by the density bonus awarded pursuant to this
section, that will contain at least any one of the following:



         (a)   Ten percent of the total units of a housing
development for LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS, defined in Cal. Health & Safety Code
§ 50079.5 as follows: persons and families whose income does not exceed the
qualifying limits for lower income families, as established and amended from
time to time pursuant to Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937.
The limits shall be published by the department in the California Code of
Regulations as soon as possible after adoption by the Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development. In the event the federal standards are discontinued,
the department shall, by regulation, establish income limits for lower income
households for all geographic areas of the state at 80% of area median
income, adjusted for family size and revised annually. LOWER INCOME
HOUSEHOLDS include very low income households and extremely low income
households.



Example of Density Bonus Calculation: Applicant proposes housing of 100 total
units with 10 units restricted for lower income households. Density bonus
granted is 20% of 100 units = 20 units. Applicant may develop 120 units with
10 of those units restricted to lower income households.



         (b)   Five percent of the total units of a housing
development for VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS, defined in Cal. Health & Safety
Code § 50105 as follows: persons and families whose incomes do not exceed
the qualifying limits for very low income families as established and amended
from time to time pursuant to Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of
1937.



         (c)   A SENIOR CITIZEN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT, defined in
Cal. Civ. Code § 51.3 as a residential development developed, substantially
rehabilitated, or substantially renovated for, senior citizens, aged 55 and
older, that has at least 35 dwelling units, or a mobilehome park that limits
residency based on age requirements for housing for older persons pursuant to
Cal. Civ. Code § 798.76 or § 799.5.



         (d)   Ten percent of the total dwelling units in a
COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT, defined in Cal. Civ. Code § 1351 as a community
apartment project, a condominium project, a planned development or a stock
cooperative for persons and families of moderate income, defined in Cal.
Health & Safety Code § 50093 as persons and families whose income does not
exceed 120% of area median income, adjusted for family size by the department
in accordance with adjustment factors adopted and amended from time to time
by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, pursuant to
Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, provided that all units
in the development are offered to the public for purchase.



      (4)   Applicant’s election of basis for bonus. For purposes
of calculating the amount of the density bonus pursuant to division (E), the
applicant who requests a density bonus pursuant to this subdivision shall
elect whether the bonus shall be awarded on the basis of subdivision (a),
(b), (c) or (d) of division (3).



      (5)   Continued affordability.



         (a)   An applicant shall agree to, and the city shall
ensure, continued affordability of all low and very low income units, which
qualified the applicant for the award of the density bonus, for 30 years or a
longer period of time, if required by the construction or mortgage financing
assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program.
Rents for the lower income density bonus units shall be set at an affordable
rent, as defined in Cal. Health & Safety Code § 50053. Owner-occupied units
shall be available at an affordable housing cost, as defined in Cal. Health &
Safety Code § 50052.5.



         (b)   An applicant shall agree to, and the city shall
ensure that the initial occupant of the moderate income units that are
directly related to the receipt of the density bonus in the common interest
development, as defined in Cal. Civ. Code § 1351 and referred to in division
(A)(3)(d) above, are persons and families of moderate income, as defined in
Cal. Health & Safety Code § 50093, and that the units are offered at an
affordable housing cost, as defined in Cal. Health & Safety Code § 50052.5.
The city shall enforce an equity-sharing agreement, unless it is in conflict
with the requirements of another public funding source or law.



   (B)   Requirements for equity-sharing agreement.  The following
apply to the equity-sharing agreement:



      (1)   Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the
value of any improvements, the downpayment, and the seller's proportionate
share of appreciation. The city shall recapture any initial subsidy and its
proportionate share of appreciation, which shall then be used within three
years for any of the purposes that promote home ownership, as described in
Cal. Health & Safety Code § 33334.2(e).



      (2)   For purposes of this division, the city's initial
subsidy shall be equal to the fair market value of the home at the time of
initial sale, minus the initial sale price to the moderate income household,
plus the amount of any down payment assistance or mortgage assistance. If
upon resale the market value is lower than the initial market value, then the
value at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value.



      (3)   For purposes of this subdivision, the city's
proportionate share of appreciation shall be equal to the ratio of the
initial subsidy to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial
sale.



   (C)   Incentives and concessions.



      (1)   An applicant for a density bonus pursuant to division
(A)(3) may submit to the city a proposal for the specific incentives or
concessions that the applicant requests pursuant to this section, and may
request a meeting with the city.



      (2)   The city shall grant the concession or incentive
requested by the applicant, unless the city makes a written finding, based
upon substantial evidence, of either of the following:



         (a)   The concession or incentive is not required in
order to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Cal. Health &
Safety Code § 50052.5, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as
specified in division (A)(5); or



         (b)   The concession or incentive would have a SPECIFIC,
ADVERSE IMPACT, defined in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65589.5(d)(2) to include a
significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact upon public health
and safety or the physical environment, or on any real property listed in the
California Register of Historical Resources, and for which there is no
feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse
impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate
income households.



      (3)   The applicant shall receive the following number of
incentives or concessions:



         (a)   One incentive or concession for projects that
include at least 10% of the total units for lower income households, at least
5% for very low income households, or at least 10% for persons and families
of moderate income in a common interest development.



         (b)   Two incentives or concessions for projects that
include at least 20% of the total units for lower income households, at least
10% for very low income households, or at least 20% for persons and families
of moderate income in a common development.



         (c)   Three incentives or concessions for projects that
include at least 30% of the total units for lower income households, at least
15% for very low income households, or at least 30% for persons and families
of moderate income in a common interest development.



      (4)   The applicant may initiate judicial proceedings if the
city refuses to grant a requested density bonus, incentive or concession.



         (a)   If a court finds that the refusal to grant a
requested density bonus, incentive or concession is in violation of this
section, the court shall award the plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and
costs of suit.



         (b)   Nothing in this division shall be interpreted to
require the city to grant an incentive or concession that has a SPECIFIC,
ADVERSE IMPACT, defined in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65589.5(d)(2) as a
significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact upon health, safety
or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to
satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.



         (c)   Nothing in this division shall be interpreted to
require the city to grant an incentive or concession that would have an
adverse impact on any real property listed in the California Register of
Historical Resources.



   (D)   Waiver or reduction of development standards.



      (1)   In no case may the city apply any development standard
that will have the effect of precluding the construction of a development
meeting the criteria of division (A)(3) at the densities or with the
concessions or incentives permitted by this section.



         (a)   An applicant may submit to the city a proposal for
the waiver or reduction of development standards and may request a meeting
with the city.



         (b)   If a court finds that the refusal to grant a
waiver or reduction of development standards is in violation of this section,
the court shall award the plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit.



         (c)   Nothing in this division shall be interpreted to
require the city to waive or reduce development standards, if the waiver or
reduction would have a SPECIFIC, ADVERSE IMPACT,  defined in Cal. Gov’t
Code § 65589.5(d)(2) to include a significant, quantifiable, direct, and
unavoidable impacts upon health, safety or the physical environment, and for
which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the
specific adverse impact.



         (d)   Nothing in this division shall be interpreted to
require the city to waive or reduce development standards that would have an
adverse impact on any real property listed in the California Register of
Historical Resources.



      (2)   The applicant shall show that the waiver or modification
is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible.



   (E)   Calculation of density bonus.



      (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, DENSITY BONUS means a
density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density,
under the applicable zoning ordinance and land use element of the general
plan as of the date of application by the applicant to the city.



         (a)   The applicant may elect to accept a lesser
percentage of density bonus.



         (b)   The amount of density bonus to which the applicant
is entitled shall vary according to the amount by which the percentage of
affordable housing units exceeds the percentage established in division
(A)(3).



      (2)   For housing developments meeting the criteria of
division (A)(3)(a), the density bonus shall be calculated as follows:

      (4)   For housing developments meeting the criteria of
division (A)(3)(c), as senior housing developments, the density bonus shall
be 20%.



      (5)   For housing developments meeting the criteria of
division (A)(3)(d), the density bonus shall be calculated as follows:

      (6)   All density calculations resulting in fractional units
shall be rounded up to the next whole number. The granting of a density bonus
shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan
amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary
approval. As used in division (A)(3), "total units" or "total dwelling units"
does not include units permitted by a density bonus awarded pursuant to this
section or any local law granting a greater density bonus. The density bonus
provided by this section shall apply to housing developments consisting of
five or more dwelling units.



   (F)   Additional density bonus through donation of land. When an
applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential
development approval donates land to the city, as provided for in this
division, the applicant shall be entitled to a 15% increase above the
otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning
ordinance and land use element of the general plan for the entire
development, as follows:

      (1)   This increase shall be in addition to any increase in
density mandated by division (A)(3), up to a maximum combined mandated
density increase of 35%, if an applicant seeks increases required pursuant to
both this division and division (A)(3).



         (a)   All density calculations resulting in fractional
units shall be rounded up to the next whole number.



         (b)   Nothing in this division shall be construed to
enlarge or diminish the authority of the city to require a developer to
donate land as a condition of development.



      (2)   An applicant shall be eligible for the increased density
bonus described in this division if all of the following conditions are met:



         (a)   The applicant donates and transfers the land no
later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map or
residential development application.



         (b)   The developable acreage and zoning classification
of the land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units
affordable to very low income households, in an amount not less than 10% of
the number of residential units of the proposed development.



         (c)   The transferred land is at least one acre in size
or of sufficient size to permit development of at least 40 units, has the
appropriate general plan designation, is appropriately zoned for development
as affordable housing, and is or will be served by adequate public facilities
and infrastructure.



            1.   The land shall have appropriate zoning and
development standards to make the development of the affordable units
feasible.



            2.   No later than the date of approval of the
final subdivision map, parcel map, or of the residential development, the
transferred land shall have all of the permits and approvals, other than
building permits, necessary for the development of the very low income
housing units on the transferred land, except that the local government may
subject the proposed development to subsequent design review, to the extent
authorized by Cal. Gov’t Code § 65583.2(i), if the design is not reviewed
by the local government prior to the time of transfer.



         (d)   The transferred land and the affordable units
shall be subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of
the units consistent with division (A)(5)(a) and (b), which shall be recorded
on the property at the time of dedication.



         (e)   The land is transferred to the local agency or to
a housing developer approved by the local agency. The local agency may
require the applicant to identify and transfer the land to the developer.



         (f)   The transferred land shall be within the boundary
of the proposed development or, if the city agrees, within one-quarter mile
of the boundary of the proposed development.



   (G)   Additional density bonus or concession or incentive through
provision of child care facility.



      (1)   When an applicant proposes to construct a housing
development that conforms to the requirements of division (A)(3) and includes
a child care facility that will be located on the premises of, as part of, or
adjacent to, the project, the city shall grant either of the following:



         (a)   An additional density bonus that is an amount of
square feet of residential space that is equal to or greater than the amount
of square feet in the child care facility.



         (b)   An additional concession or incentive that
contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of
the child care facility.



      (2)   The city shall require, as a condition of approving the
housing development, that the following occur:



         (a)   The child care facility shall remain in operation
for a period of time that is as long as or longer than the period of time
during which the density bonus units are required to remain affordable
pursuant to division (A)(5).



         (b)   Of the children who attend the child care
facility, the children of very low income households, lower income
households, or families of moderate income shall equal a percentage that is
equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units that are required
for very low income households, lower income households, or families of
moderate income pursuant to division (A)(3).



      (3)   Notwithstanding any requirement of this division, the
city shall not be required to provide a density bonus or concession for a
child care facility if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the
community has adequate child care facilities.



      (4)   As used in this section, CHILD CARE FACILITY means a
CHILD CARE FACILITY other than a family day care home, including but not
limited to, infant centers, preschools, extended day care facilities, and
school age child care centers.



      (5)   As used in this section, HOUSING DEVELOPMENT means one
or more groups of projects for residential units constructed in the planned
development of the city. For the purposes of this section, HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT also includes a subdivision or COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT, 
defined in Cal. Civ. Code § 1351 as a community apartment project, a
condominium project, a planned development or a stock cooperative, for
PERSONS AND FAMILIES OF MODERATE INCOME, defined in Cal. Health & Safety Code
§ 50093 as persons and families whose income does not exceed 120% of area
median income, approved by the city, and consists of residential units or
unimproved residential lots, and either a project to substantially
rehabilitate and convert an existing commercial building to residential use,
or the substantial rehabilitation of an existing MULTIFAMILY DWELLING,
defined in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65863.4(d) as any structure designed for
human habitation that has been divided into two or more legally created
independent living quarters, where the result of the rehabilitation would be
a net increase in available residential units. For the purpose of calculating
a density bonus, the residential units do not have to be based upon
individual subdivision maps or parcels. The density bonus shall be permitted
in geographic areas of the housing development other than the areas where the
units for the lower income households are located.



      (6)   The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be
interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, local
coastal plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval.



      (7)   For the purposes of this chapter, CONCESSION or
INCENTIVE means any of the following:



         (a)   A reduction in site development standards or a
modification of zoning code requirements or architectural design requirements
that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California
Building Standards Commission, as provided in Part 2.5 (the State Building
Code commencing with Cal. Health & Safety Code § 18901) of Division 13 of
the Health and Safety Code, including but not limited to, a reduction in
setback and square footage requirements, and in the ratio of vehicular
parking spaces that would otherwise be required, that results in
identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions.



         (b)   Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with
the housing project, if commercial, office, industrial or other land uses
will reduce the cost of the housing development, and if the commercial,
office, industrial or other land uses are compatible with the housing project
and the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed
housing project will be located.



         (c)   Other regulatory incentives or concessions
proposed by the developer or the city that result in identifiable,
financially sufficient and actual cost reductions. This division does not
limit or require the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing
development, including the provision of publicly owned land, by the city or
the waiver of fees or dedication requirements.



   (H)   City’s discretion in granting density bonuses. Nothing in
this section shall be construed to prohibit the city from granting a density
bonus greater than what is described in this section for a development that
meets the requirements of this section, or from granting a proportionately
lower density bonus than what is required by this section for developments
that do not meet the requirements of this section.



   (I)   Definitions.  For purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply:



      (1)   DEVELOPMENT STANDARD includes site or construction
conditions that apply to a residential development pursuant to any ordinance,
general plan element, specific plan, charter amendment, or other local
condition, law, policy, resolution or regulation.



      (2)   MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE RESIDENTIAL DENSITY.  The density
allowed under the zoning ordinance, or if a range of density is permitted,
the maximum allowable density for the specific zoning range applicable to the
project.

      (1)   Upon the request of the developer, the city shall not
require a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest
parking, of a development meeting the criteria of division (A)(3), that
exceeds the following ratios:



         (a)   Zero to one bedrooms: one onsite parking space.



         (b)   Two to three bedrooms: two onsite parking spaces.



         (c)   Four and more bedrooms: two and one-half parking
spaces.



      (2)   If the total number of parking spaces required for a
development is other than a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to
the next whole number. For purposes of this division, a development may
provide “onsite parking” through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but
not through on-street parking.



      (3)   This division shall apply to a development that meets
the requirements of division (A)(3), but only at the request of the

§ 23.20.080  FLEXIBLE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.



   (A)   The special objectives of the flexible development standards
in the R-3 zone are to:



      (1)   Promote higher quality multiple-family residential
development by providing a more flexible approach to development standards;



      (2)   Encourage innovative design and efficient use of land
which might otherwise be stifled by standard, rigid development standards;



      (3)   Encourage the consolidation of parcels;



      (4)   Permit developments to be judged on individual merits
and overall impacts on the site and the neighborhood.



   (B)   In order to encourage the development of higher quality
multiple-family residential projects in accordance with the above objectives,
an applicant for a residential planned development may request, and the
Planning Commission may grant, subject to the findings in division (C) below,
three variations to the provisions contained in Chapter 23.20, three
variations to the provisions contained in Chapter 23.42 and three variations
to the provisions contained in Chapter 23.44 of this title. In addition to
the variations listed above, flexible parking standards may also be requested
per § 23.52.060 of this code.



   (C)   In order for a variation to be granted, the following findings
must be made in a positive manner:



      (1)   That the variation is necessary to achieve a better
design than that which would result from application of the existing
regulations;



      (2)   That the variation will materially affect adjoining
properties and will contribute to a better overall development than would be
possible under the existing regulations.



   (D)   All developments utilizing the flexible development standards
shall have a minimum net parcel area of 40,000 square feet.

§ 23.33.010  PURPOSE.



   The specific plan is a recognized planning tool to systematically
implement the city’s General Plan for part of the area covered by the
General Plan. The 2500 West Hellman Avenue Specific Plan is created to
promote the beneficial development of the zone in a manner consistent with
the long-term land use and planning policies. This zone is designated to
facilitate a self storage project which is consistent with the reuse of an
unoccupied site and to coordinate future development with the Zone.



(Ord. 4601, passed 6-25-12)



§ 23.33.020  FINDINGS.



   This Council hereby finds, determines and declares that:



   (A)   The establishment of the 2500 West Hellman Avenue Specific
Plan for the certain parcel of property located at 2500-2520 West Hellman
Avenue (the “Site”) is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
substantial property rights and is not detrimental to the public welfare nor
injurious to the property of other persons located in the vicinity of the
said Site and is not inconsistent with Title XXIII of this code.



   (B)   The 2500 West Hellman Avenue Specific Plan accomplishes and is
consistent with the objectives, policies, general land uses and programs of
the Alhambra General Plan; and the provisions of the Specific Plan are
consistent with the direction and intent of the General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance, as the Site is located in an area which is characterized by a mix
of land uses, including commercial, educational and residential.



   (C)   The 2500 West Hellman Avenue Specific Plan is not detrimental
to the public interest, health, safety, convenience or welfare; and said
Specific Plan is a logical continuation of the uses that already exist in the
area.

   23.35.030   Contents of specific plan



   23.35.040   Alhambra Walk Specific Plan Zone



§ 23.35.010  PURPOSE.



   The specific plan is a recognized planning tool to systematically
implement the city's General Plan for part of the area covered by the General
Plan. The Alhambra Walk Specific Plan Zone is created to promote the
beneficial development of the zone in a manner consistent with long-term land
use and planning policies. This zone is designed to facilitate a residential
project which is consistent with the revitalization of the downtown area and
to coordinate future development within the zone.



(Ord. 4460, passed 3-22-04)



§ 23.35.020  FINDINGS.



   The Council hereby finds, determines and declares that:



   (A)   The establishment of an Alhambra Walk Specific Plan for those
certain parcels of real property located at 100 East Bay State Street and 101
East Commonwealth Avenue (the "Site") is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights and not detrimental to the public
welfare nor injurious to the property of other persons located in the
vicinity of said Site.



   (B)   The Alhambra Walk Specific Plan accomplishes the objectives,
policies, general landuses and programs of the Alhambra General Plan; to wit:
A Specific Plan has been adopted for a residential development on a site
which has been historically residential. The provisions of this Specific Plan
are consistent with the direction and intent of the General Plan and Zoning
Ordinances. The differences are with detail areas; such as, unit density,
parking and some development standards. The said adopted Specific Plan will
facilitate a residential project which is consistent with the revitalization
of the downtown area.



   (C)   The Alhambra Walk Specific Plan is not detrimental to the
public interest, health, safety convenience or welfare; to wit: the said
Specific Plan is a logical continuation of the historical land use pattern on
the site. Prior to the theater development, the property was zoned for high
density residential purposes. The Alhambra Walk Specific Plan will allow this
vacant parcel to be put to a productive use.



   (D) The Alhambra Walk Specific Plan is necessary for the preservation
and enjoyment of substantial property rights and not detrimental to the
public welfare nor injurious to the property of other persons located in the
vicinity of said site and is not inconsistent with the purpose of Title XXIII
of this code.

Community Development to consolidate and coordinate driveways and parking
areas. The reciprocal parking and access agreement shall be irrevocable and
shall be recorded with the County Recorder's Office to remain a permanent
condition of the development. The failure to execute, record or comply with
an agreement con-stitutes grounds for the city to revoke or terminate any
permit or approval necessary for the proposed development.



   (C)   The applicant shall agree that the parking areas and connected
driveways may be accessed and used by vehicles destined for any adjacent
property, provided that such adjacent property has also recorded a reciprocal
parking and access agreement. The applicant shall also agree that parking
areas and connected driveways may be accessed and used by vehicles destined
for any property with a recorded reciprocal parking and access agreement

§ 23.43.020  FINDINGS.



   This Council hereby finds, determines and declares that:



   (A)   The establishment of the 2300 Poplar Boulevard Specific Plan
for the certain parcel of property located at 2300 Poplar Boulevard (the
“site”) is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial
property rights and is not detrimental to the public welfare nor injurious to
the property of other persons located in the vicinity of the said site and is
not inconsistent with Title XXIII of this code.



   (B)   The 2300 Poplar Boulevard Specific Plan accomplishes and is

   The provisions of this chapter are designed to ensure that new or
modified uses and development will harmonize with the existing or potential
develop-ment of the surrounding neighborhood and produce an environment of
stable, desirable character. These provisions are also intended to implement
the goals and policies contained in the community design element of the
Alhambra General Plan and to provide orderly development of the city through
design review of new buildings and structures and their environs and
establish usage that will promote and enhance good design, site relationships
and other aesthetic considerations in the city.



('86 Code, § 23.44.010) (Ord. 4110, passed  - - )



§ 23.44.020  APPLICABILITY.



   Any land use entitlement which authorizes new construction or exterior
modifications to an existing structure shall be subject to the design review
standards set forth in this chapter. Approval of an application for such a
project shall be obtained pursuant to this chapter prior to the issuance of
any building permit or other entitlement.



('86 Code, § 23.44.020) (Ord. 4110, passed  - - )



§ 23.44.030  GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS.



   The following design standards shall apply to all new development
within the city:



   (A)   General design standards.  While encouraging the broadest
possible range of individual and creative design, the Planning Commission, or
the Director of Community Development, where authorized, may grant design
review approval only if the proposal conforms to all of the following
standards:



      (1)   The proposed development is of a quality and character
which is compatible with the surrounding area and harmonizes with existing
development.



      (2)   The design improves community appearances by avoiding
excessive variety and mono-tonous repetition.



      (3)   Proposed signage is an integral architectural feature
which does not overwhelm or dominate the structure or object to which it is
attached.



      (4)   Lighting is stationary and is deflected away from
adjacent properties.



      (5)   Mechanical equipment, storage and trash areas and
utilities are architecturally screened from view.



      (6)   The proposed plans indicate proper consideration for the
relationship between the existing and finished grades of the site to be
improved and adjacent properties.



      (7)   The proposed development or modifi-cation is not, in its
exterior design and appearance, so at variance with the appearance of
existing buildings and development in the neighborhood as to cause the nature
of the local environment to materially depreciate in appearance.



      (8)   The proposed design is compatible with existing
development in the area in terms of scale, height, bulk, materials,
cohesiveness, colors, roof pitch, roof eaves and the preservation of privacy.
The use of T1-11 or similar plywood siding shall not be permitted.



      (9)   The proposed design promotes a harmonious transition in
terms of scale and character between areas of different land use designations.



      (10)    All building elevations have been archi-tecturally
treated in a uniform manner, including the incorporation within the side and
rear building eleva-tions of some or all of the design elements used for the
primary facades. Parking structures shall also incorporate some or all of the
design elements used for the primary facades.

shall be limited to one curb cut per 100 feet of street frontage. Such
developments shall utilize rear or alley access whenever practical.



      (13)    On-site lighting shall be installed along all
vehicular access ways and major walkways. Such lighting shall be directed
onto the driveways and walkways within the development and away from adjacent
properties. Lighting shall also be installed within all covered and enclosed
parking areas.

including transformers, terminal boxes, pull boxes, air conditioner
con-densers, gas meters and electric meter cabinets shall be screened from
public view and/or treated to match the materials and colors of the adjacent
building. The project design may not include the use of window or wall
mounted air conditioning units. All roof-mounted mechanical equipment and
duct systems shall comply with the screening standards in division (B) of
this section.



      (16)    In any zone where zero lot line development is

similar material, as approved by the Director.



      (17)    All buildings shall display the street address number
in a prominent location on the street side. In multi-unit developments, each
unit shall prominently display the unit number or designation. All address
numbers shall be easily visible to vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic. The
street address and unit numbers shall be no less than four inches in height
and shall be of a color contrasting to the background to which they are
attached.



      (18)    Balconies situated above the first floor shall be
located at least 15 feet from any interior property line to minimize
“overviewing” onto adjacent residential properties.

§ 23.44.060  SOLAR ENERGY DESIGN STANDARDS.



   These provisions are intended to incorporate, to the extent feasible,
passive heating and cooling opportunities into the design of residential
develop-ments. They are further designed to assure that solar energy systems
are protected from shading and con-form in appearance to the surrounding
neighborhood.



   (A)   Subdivision design.



      (1)   The design of a subdivision for which a tentative map is
required shall maximize the number of future buildings which will receive
sun-light sufficient for using solar energy systems. All proposed structures
and vegetation shall be sited to provide solar access to a south wall of the
greatest possible number of buildings.



      (2)   Streets and lot sizes and configurations shall be
designed to permit a maximum number of buildings to be oriented so that south
wall and roof areas may face within 45° of due south.



      (3)   Design of lot size and configuration should permit
buildings to receive cooling benefits from both prevailing summer breezes and
existing shading vegetation, to the extent solar access is not impaired.



      (4)   Any pool or spa facilities owned and maintained by a
home owners association shall be provided with a solar cover and/or solar
water-heating system.



      (5)   All residential dwelling units shall be prepared for
future solar preheating of water through provision of adequate space for a
storage tank and a pathway to the roof for plumbing, so that retrofitting is
architecturally feasible. The storage tank shall not be located in any
required front yard, nor shall it be visible from any public right-of-way.



   (B)   Protection of solar access.  No building, wall, fence or
other structure shall be constructed or modified in a residential zone, and
no vegetation may be placed or allowed to grow so as to obstruct more than
10% of the absorption area of a solar energy system on a neighboring lot at
any time.



   (C)   Solar energy systems design standards.



      (1)   Roof-mounted solar collectors shall be placed in the
most obscure location without reducing the operating efficiency of the
collectors. Wall-mounted and ground mounted solar collectors shall be
screened from public view.



      (2)   Collectors shall be mounted at the same angle or as
close as possible to the pitch of the roof. Deviations may be permitted
subject to the approval of the Director of Community Development.



      (3)   Appurtenant equipment, particularly plumbing and related
fixtures, shall be installed in the attic, where feasible.



      (4)   Large accessory fixtures which must be exposed (for
example, storage tanks) shall be screened through architectural features that
harmonize with other design elements of the structure.



      (5)   Exterior surfaces shall have a matte finish and shall be
color-coordinated to harmonize with roof materials or other dominant colors
of the structure.

Revitalization District:



   (A)   Demolition, alteration, removal, or change prohibited without
certificate of design approval.



      (1)   No person shall demolish, remove, alter or materially
change the appearance of any structure or portion of structure visible from a
public street or way, nor shall any permit for such actions be issued without
first having applied for and been issued a certificate of design approval by
the Design Review Board pursuant to Chapter 23.64.



      (2)   A certificate of design approval shall be issued for all
such proposed actions determined by the Design Review Board to be consistent
with the purpose of the district, the provisions of this chapter and the
“Downtown Alhambra Revitalization Con-ceptual Design Plan and Design
Guidelines,” dated March, 1981 (Downtown Design Guidelines). A certificate
of design approval shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other
required permit. The Design Review Board may adopt criteria delegating
certain or all such decisions on certificates of design approval to the
Director of Community Development or his or her designee.



      (3)   No certificate of design approval for demolition of a
structure or portion thereof shall be issued unless the Design Review Board
finds that the structure or portion thereof is not a significant
architectural or historic asset to the district and its loss would,
therefore, not have a significant effect on the purposes of the district.



   (B)   Duty to maintain structures and premises; demolition by
neglect prohibited.  Every person in possession or control of a structure
and appurtenant premises in the district shall maintain and keep in good
repair such structure and premises. Structures and appurtenant premises in
good repair present no material variance in apparent condition from
surrounding structures in good repair in compliance with these requirements.
“Good repair” includes and is defined as that level of maintenance and
repair which clearly insures the continued availability of such structure and
premises for lawful reasonable uses: prevents deterioration, dilapidation,
and decay of any exterior portion of such structure and premises, avoids
impairment to surrounding struc-tures or the benefits of the district.



   (C)   Standards for approval.  Design review approval shall be
granted if a proposal is found to be consistent with the “Downtown Alhambra
Revitaliza-tion Conceptual Design Plan and Design Guidelines” and the
purpose of Chapter 23.27 of this code as to:



      (1)   Height, bulk and area of building;

      (11)    Public area graphics;



      (12)    Landscaping.



      (13)    Conditions of approval may be applied when the
proposed design does not comply com-pletely with the above standards and
shall be such as to bring the design into conformity. When the pro-posed
design does not meet the above standards and cannot be conditioned to comply
with the standards, the plan shall be denied and referred to the applicant
for redesign and resubmittal.



   (D)   Certain vehicular uses along main street prohibited.  The
following vehicular-related uses of property and structures along Main Street
within the district are not required to make reasonable use of such property
or structures, are inconsistent with the architectural character and purpose
of the district, and are prohibited:



      (1)   Vehicular ingress onto and egress from property and
structures.



      (2)   Parking lots or structures.



   (E)   Setback not required.  There shall be no required setbacks or
structures from property lines. The Design Review Board may as a condition of
approval of any application require a setback where such setback enhances the
integration of the project into the architectural character of the district
and does not substantially deprive the owner of all reasonable use of his
property.



   (F)   District regulations supersede conflicting general
regulations.  The regulations contained in this chapter are solely
applicable to the area within the district. Regulations contained in this
chapter apply in addition to all other general zoning regulations not in
conflict with the provisions of this chapter. Where there is a conflict with
the general zoning regulations, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.

chapter or other provisions of this code or other law shall also constitute
grounds for revocation of the permit. The Director shall provide a written
notification to the permittee and property owner stating the specific grounds
for a revocation and a demand for correction and abatement. The notice shall
allow a maximum of ten days from mailing of the notice to correct or abate

revoking a permit issued under this chapter may appeal the decision to the
Planning Commission. The appeal shall be made by filing a written notice
thereof with the Department setting for the grounds for the appeal not later
than ten days after receiving notice of the decision of the Director. The

provisions of this chapter, or any ordinance, shall be deemed a new and
separate offense for each day that such condition continues to exist.

severally liable for each violation and for payment of any fine and costs of
abatement.



   (E)   No fines shall be imposed for a violation of this chapter
until 90 days after its effective date. All collection boxes existing at the
effective date of Ordinance 4678 and in compliance with prior existing
ordinances shall be deemed legal nonconforming uses, but shall nevertheless
apply for a permit as required herein within 30 days of the effective date
and shall conform to all requirements of this chapter to the extent possible
in their present location. Any collection boxes not applying for permits

   (A)   Support the use of signs to aid orientation and to advertise
and identify business and activities and express local character;



   (B)   Facilitate the ability of the public to identify uses and
premises without confusion;



   (C)   Promote the appearance of the city as an attractive place to
live, work, and trade by controlling and regulating the design, quality of
materials, loca-tion, scale, illumination, and maintenance of signs;



   (D)   Ensure the use of signs that do not create distractions that
may jeopardize pedestrian or vehicular traffic safety or produce glare which
adversely affects adjacent uses; and



   (E)   Provide minimum standards designed to safeguard the life,
health, safety, and public welfare while encouraging functional flexibility,
variety, and compatibility.



('86 Code, § 23.50.010) (Ord. 4110, passed  - - ) 



§ 23.50.020  GENERAL REGULATIONS AND DEFINITIONS.



   (A)   Applicability.  The provisions of this chapter shall apply to
all signs within the city, except those located within the borders of the
Downtown Revitalization District as defined in Chapter 23.27. Sign standards
for the Downtown Revitalization District may be found in Chapter 23.51 of
this code.



   (B)   Zoning clearance required.  No sign shall be constructed,
displayed, altered or relocated unless a zoning clearance has been approved
by the Director of Community Development; provided, however, the sign is not
specifically exempted from this requirement.



   (C)   Design standards. The Director of Develop-ment Services shall
approve a zoning clearance for a sign if the sign is in compliance with the
provisions of this chapter and if the sign complies with the following design
standards:



      (1)   The sign primarily identifies the business,
establishment, or type of activity conducted on the same premises, or the
product, service, or interest being offered for sale, rent, or lease thereon;



      (2)   The sign is restrained in size, design, and
illumination, and as an identification device, does not excessively compete
for the public's attention;



      (3)   The sign is harmonious with the materials, color,
texture, scale, size, shape, height, placement, and design of the building,
property, and neighborhood of which it is a part;



      (4)   The sign improves community appear-ances by avoiding
excessive variety and monotonous repetition and is not so at variance with
the appearance of the neighborhood as to cause the nature of the local
environment to materially depreciate in appearance;   



      (5)   The sign is architecturally integrated and does not
overwhelm or dominate the structure or object to which it is attached;



      (6)   The sign's illumination is directed solely at the sign
or is internal to it;



      (7)   The sign's design and placement would not be detrimental
to the public interest, health, safety, convenience, or welfare.



   (D)   Other regulations.



      (1)   In computing the allowable area for freestanding signs,
the street frontage of the parcel of record on which the business is located
shall be used. In cases of parcels having multiple street frontage, the
longest frontage shall be used.



      (2)   In computing the allowable area for any signs attached
to a building, the building frontage facing a public right-of-way shall be
used. In cases of businesses having multiple building frontages, all such
frontage shall be designated as the building front age.



      (3)   Calculation of the total sign area for any business
shall include all signs unless specifically exempted from this chapter.



      (4)   Where more than one business is located in a building or
upon a single parcel of record, the facade of each business facing a public
right-of-way shall be considered as a separate building frontage.



      (5)   Business establishments which provide and continuously
maintain entrances open to the public through their rear and/or parking lot
facades are entitled to rear and/or parking lot facade signage as specified
in this chapter.



      (6)   Where businesses face a common arcade, mall or walkway
located on the same parcel of record, the facade of each business facing the
arcade, mall, or walkway shall be considered as a separate building frontage.



      (7)   A sign shall not project over a public right-of-way
except that projecting signs, awnings, canopies, or marquees may project up
to 50% of the distance from the lot line to the curb if in con-formance with
all other applicable regulations.



      (8)   The sign area of multifaced signs shall be computed
based on the total area of all sign faces.



      (9)   Sign area is not transferable from any one street or
building frontage to any other street or building frontage.



      (10)    In cases where two or more regulations are applicable,

property may appeal the determination of the Director of Community
Development ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of
appeal with the Planning Commission.

Section

   23.51.020   General regulations and definitions



   23.51.030   All signs require permit; exceptions



   23.51.040   Permitted signs



   23.51.050   Limitations on sign types



   23.51.060   Prohibited signs



   23.51.070   Signs of special significance



   23.51.080   Existing nonconforming signs



§ 23.51.010  PURPOSE.



   To carry out the purpose for the downtown revitalization district,
strict sign regulations are required permitting the minimum signage,
necessary to communicate with the users of the district in a time, place, and
manner appropriate to the zoned uses of the district and consistent with the
architectural character and pedestrian-oriented activity of the district. The
minimum signage requirements to com-municate with pedestrians are different
from those required to communicate with occupants in auto-mobiles and those
regulations are designed to encourage pedestrian uses and discourage
vehicular uses in the district. A further purpose is to reduce the clutter of
signs that fail to relate to the architectural character and design of the
buildings. Sign schemes should be coordinated to integrate design plans,
color schemes, and signing among adjoining property owners.

§ 23.52.060  REDUCTION OF REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   The alternating use of parking facilities may be approved in
cases where parties wish to coopera-tively establish and operate parking
facilities and where these uses generate parking demands primarily during
hours when the remaining uses are not in operation (for example, if one use
operates during the daytime or on weekends and the other use operates during
evenings or weekdays only). The burden of proof for a reduction in the total
number of required parking spaces, however, shall remain with the applicant,
and documentation shall be submitted substantiating the reasons for this
requested parking reduction. An alternating use agreement may be approved
only under the following circumstances:



      (1)   That a sufficient number of spaces shall be provided to
meet the greatest parking demand of the alternating uses;



      (2)   That satisfactory statements have been submitted by the
parties operating such facilities, describing the nature of the uses and
times when such uses operate so as to indicate the lack of conflict between
them; and



      (3)   That additional documents or agree-ments as may be
deemed necessary in each particular case to assure provision for and the
maintenance of the required parking spaces have been provided.



   (B)   Parking requirements for a secondary use within the same
building as the primary use (for example, a restaurant in a hotel or a shop
within a sport facility) may be reduced by up to one-half, upon the
determination by the Director that such a reduction is justified.



   (C)   For all projects utilizing the flexible development standards
allowed in § 23.20.080 and for projects within the area zoned CBD or R-3 and
where the permitted height is 75 feet, the Planning Commission may reduce,
upon the determination that such a reduction is justified, the number of
parking spaces required for efficiency units and one-bedroom units as follows:



      (1)   Spaces may not be required to be enclosed;



      (2)   One-third of the spaces may be compact size;



      (3)   The number required for one-bedroom units may be reduced
by up to 25%; and



      (4)   The number required for efficiency units may be reduced
by up to 33%;



      (5)   For projects utilizing the flexible development
standards, alternative parking standards may also be proposed by the
developer for considera-tion by the Planning Commission, in such cases, the
burden of proof shall lie with the applicant and docu-mentation shall be
submitted substantiating the reasons for the alternative parking standards.



   (D)   The Planning Commission may reduce the number of parking
spaces required for senior citizen housing by up to 50%, or 75% for low and
moderate income senior citizen housing based upon findings that the proposed
development is located in proximity to commercial activities and services,
and is adequately served by public transportation systems.



   (E)   The Planning Commission may permit up to one-half of the
required parking spaces to be uncovered for dwelling units provided
exclusively for low and moderate income and senior citizen house-holds.



   (F)   The Planning Commission may count city-owned public parking
facilities within 400 feet of a use, measured from the use's nearest public
access to such parking, in waiving all or part of the parking requirements if
the sum of the required parking for such facilities is less than the existing
parking provided.

located.



   (B)   General requirements.



      (1)   A nonconforming building which is damaged to an extent
of one-half or more of its replacement cost immediately prior to such damage
may be restored only if made to conform to all provisions of this title,
except as specified in § 23.56.030(A)(6). The replacement cost shall be
determined by the chief building official, whose decision may be appealed to
the City Council.

in any R zoneif the following criteria are met:



      (1)   The total number of units on the site shall be in
conformance with current density requirements.  Developments which exceed
current density standards shall not be eligible for additions to dwelling
units.



      (2)   Any addition shall neither increase the number of
families that can be housed in the structure nor reduce the amount of
accessibility of existing parking spaces.



   (D)   Any use which is nonconforming only because of changes in the
off-street parking requirements by the adoption of this chapter, or any
amend-ment thereto, may be expanded, increased or modified, and no addition
to or change in the off-street parking facilities shall be required except as
provided herein:

sufficient to comply with the require-ments of this title after expansion,
increase or modifi-cation, additional parking facilities shall be added. The
capacity of the facilities shall equal the difference between the off-street
parking facilities this title would require for the use as expanded,
increased or modified, and the off-street parking facilities as required for
the use before expansion, increase or modification. Any additional off-street
parking facilities provided under these conditions shall be developed
pursuant to the provisions of this title.



   (E)   Additions may be made to a nonconforming building or structure

this subsection shall not be construed to authorize the modifications of any
provisions of this chapter, nor to extend the termination date of the subject
nonconforming use.



   (F)   No restoration, addition to or remodeling of a nonconforming
structure, or any part thereof, as authorized under the provisions of this
chapter, shall be deemed to have extended such a structure's permissible
lifetime beyond the periods of time specified in this chapter for the
original structure unless the restoration, addition or remodeling results in
bringing the structure into full compliance with the requirements of this
title for the district or zone in which the site is located.



   (G)   No extension, expansion or enlargement of any nonconforming
use, nor any modification of off-street parking facilities, as authorized
under the provisions of this chapter, shall be deemed to have extended the
permissible lifetime of a nonconforming use beyond the periods of time
specified in this chapter.

   ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT or ADU.  Will have the meaning set forth in
Government Code section 65852.2(i), which is: an attached or a detached
residential dwelling unit which provides complete independent living
facilities for one or more persons, and includes permanent provisions for
living, sleeping, eating, cooking (i.e., stove, refrigerator, and sink), and
sanitation (i.e., bathroom with shower or bathtub) on the same parcel as the
single-family dwelling is situated. An ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT also includes
the following: (a) an efficiency unit, as defined in Health & Safety Code §
17958.1, and (b) a manufactured home, as defined in Health and Safety Code §
18007.



   ATTACHED ADU.  An ADU that is attached to the existing single-family
dwelling unit.



   CAR SHARE VEHICLE OPERATION.  A subscription or membership service
that provides automobile reservations for an additional fee to its members on
an hourly and/or daily basis.



   DETACHED ADU.  An ADU that is detached from the existing single-family
dwelling unit.



   INTEGRATED ADU.  An ADU that is located within the living area of the
existing single-family dwelling unit or is a conversion of an existing
garage. For an ADU in the living area of an existing dwelling unit, the entry

main living portion of the existing dwelling unit.



   PUBLIC TRANSIT.  A fixed bus route with regular service covering a
significant portion of the city that is not a subscription service. For
purposes of this definition, “regular service” means service provided at

Multiple-Family Residential) Zone, and R-3 (Multiple-Family Residential) Zone.



   (B)   An ADU may only be constructed on a legal lot of 6,500 square
feet or more that conforms to the lot area, width and depth requirements and
otherdevelopment standards of the underlying zone. If a legal lot does not
conform to one or more requirements of this code other than the foregoing lot
area, width and depth requirements, an ADU may be constructed on the lot if
the nonconformity does not arise in whole or in part from a lack of covered
parking.



   (C)   Only one ADU is permitted on a lot.



   (D)   An ADU shall not be counted as a “unit” for density
purposes but shall be counted as a “unit” for purposes of compliance with
state laws and requirements.



(Ord. 4724, passed 12-11-17; Am. Ord. 4738, passed 6-25-18; Am. Ord. 4739,

§ 23.57.030  REVIEW PROCESS.



   (A)   For an attached or detached ADU, an application and fee must
be filed according to the applicable provisions of the underlying zone. The
application shall be reviewed and approved by the Director based on
compliance with this chapter and the approval shall be considered a zoning
clearance as set forth in Chapter 23.08. The ADU must be designed to be
compatible with the main dwelling unit, including, as applicable, the use of
the same general architecture, same exterior materials, same or similar roof
covering, same or complementary exterior colors, and the same or similar
architectural details and other features as the main dwelling unit. The ADU
must otherwise meet the design standards set forth in Chapter 23.44 of this
code, and the design elements of the application shall be subject to the same
review process as any application in the underlying zone.



   (B)   For an integrated ADU that has independent exterior access
from the existing residence, and side and rear setbacks that are sufficient
for fire safety, an application must be filed according to the applicable
provisions of the underlying zone and approved by the Director based on
compliance with this chapter.



   (C)   Upon approval of an ADU by the Director, the applicant shall
have a period of one year to submit building plans and other necessary plans
to the building department. No ADU may be constructed until the building
department has issued required permits and approvals necessary for the
proposed construction.



(Ord. 4724, passed 12-11-17)



§ 23.57.040  UNIT SIZE AND PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.



   (A)   The following size limits apply:



      (1)   An ADU may not exceed 50% of the square footage of the
main dwelling unit or 1,200 square feet in area, whichever is less.



      (2)   An ADU must be at least 400 square feet.



      (3)   A property owner may not designate the existing unit as
the ADU and propose a new larger unit as the main dwelling unit. This
limitation shall not apply where an existing unit is in the back half of a
legal lot that conforms to the development standards of the underlying zone
and the applicant proposes to construct a larger unit in front of the
existing unit. All property development standards for primary units set forth
elsewhere in this title shall apply to the new larger unit.



   (B)   The following property development standards apply:



      (1)   An ADU may be placed anywhere on a residential lot as
long as the placement of the ADU meets all development standards of the
underlying zone, except as specifically set forth in this chapter.



      (2)   The minimum front, side and rear setbacks of the
underlying zone apply to an ADU as they do to any other accessory structure.
Notwithstanding the general applicability of setbacks to ADUs, no setback
will be required for an existing garage that is converted to an ADU, as
compared to an ADU proposed to be attached to a garage, to which setbacks of
the underlying zone apply. For both Integrated ADUs located in former garages
and ADUs attached to garages, an access path to the ADU’s entry may utilize
the existing driveway in part but must be clearly separated and have a
different design component separate from the driveway.



      (3)   An ADU may not cause the overall development of the lot
to exceed the floor area ratio (FAR) for the applicable zone.



      (4)   An ADU may not cause the overall development of the lot
to exceed the maximum lot coverage standard for the applicable zone. The open
space area on the lot shall be commonly accessible to both the main unit and
the ADU unless otherwise approved by the Director.



      (5)   An ADU may not violate the minimum distance between
building standards for the applicable zone.



      (6)   An attached or detached ADU must have a fence meeting
the requirements for the applicable zone put in place along the side and rear
property lines nearest the structure.

additional parking requirements for ADUs.



   (A)   Number. The parking requirement for an attached or detached
ADU is one open or enclosed parking space per bedroom. For purposes of this
section, a studio unit shall count as having one bedroom.



   (B)   Location. Required parking spaces may be provided as tandem
parking on an existing driveway. Off-street parking is permitted in setback
areas in locations determined by the city or through tandem parking, unless
specific findings are made that parking in setback areas or tandem parking is
not feasible based upon specific site or regional topographical or fire and
life safety conditions.



   (C)   An integrated ADU that replaces the main dwelling unit’s
existing garage shall not cause the applicant to have to construct
replacement covered parking for the main unit. Main unit parking must be
replaced at a one-to-one ratio, but may be uncovered and provided in tandem
if needed to meet the replacement requirement, though it may not be located
in front of an entry door or within the clear path of access to an entry door
to the integrated ADU.



   (D)   Exemption. No parking is required for an ADU in any of the
following instances:



      (1)   The ADU is located within one-half mile of a public
transit stop or station.



      (2)   The ADU is located on a parcel that has been designated
on a local, state, or national register of historic places or districts.



      (3)   The ADU is an integrated ADU.



      (4)   When on-street parking permits are required, but not
offered to the occupant of the ADU.



      (5)   When there is a car share vehicle operation parking hub
or station located within one block of the ADU.



(Ord. 4724, passed 12-11-17)



§ 23.57.060  OWNER-OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT.



   (A)   The applicant for an ADU must be an owner-occupant of the
existing residential unit.



   (B)   Upon approval of an ADU application, a deed restriction that
provides the following must be recorded with the County of Los Angeles before
occupancy and the declaration will be binding on all future owners of the
parcel:



      (1)   Either the main dwelling unit or the ADU will be
occupied by the property owner;



      (2)   The ADU may not be sold separately from the main
dwelling unit and underlying parcel; and



      (3)   The unit not occupied by the property owner may not be
rented for a period of less than 30 days at a time.

   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this code, a detached ADU may
not exceed the height of the existing residential unit and may only consist
of one story.



(Ord. 4724, passed 12-11-17)



§ 23.57.080  CODE COMPLIANCE.



   The ADU must comply with all currently-applicable building, health and
fire codes, except that an attached or integrated ADU is not required to
provide fire sprinklers if sprinklers are not required for the main dwelling
unit.



(Ord. 4724, passed 12-11-17)



§ 23.57.090  COMMON ENTRANCE.



   An attached or integrated ADU may be served either by a common entrance
with the main dwelling unit or a separate entrance to the ADU, which must be
located on the side or at the rear of the main dwelling unit. No ADU will be
required to provide a new passageway from the ADU to the street.



(Ord. 4724, passed 12-11-17)



§ 23.57.100  UTILITIES.



   An ADU shall be served either by separate meters for water, electric,
and gas service or by the main dwelling unit’s meters. An ADU’s sewer
service may be provided through the main dwelling unit’s sewer line,
provided that the applicant makes a showing that the existing sewer line has
sufficient capacity and slope to ensure proper flow strength for the ADU’s
sewer output. If sufficient capacity and slope cannot be ensured, an ADU may
utilize a separate sewer line.

other property of like character, in the same vicinity and zone, can be used.
A variance or modification shall not be granted which confers a special

authorizes a use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by
the zoning regulations governing the parcel of property.

      (3)   Further development of a lot occupied by a nonconforming
use by the addition of con-forming uses or structures, pursuant to Chapter
23.56 of this title.

§ 23.68.060  FINDINGS.



   Following a public hearing, the Planning Commission shall record the
decision in writing and shall recite therein the findings of fact upon which
such decision is based. The Commission may approve and/or modify an
application in whole or in part, with or without conditions, only after it
makes all of the following findings of fact in a positive manner:



   (A)   There are special circumstances or exceptional characteristics
applicable to the property involved, including size, shape, topography,
location or surroundings, such that strict application of the zoning
ordinance deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in
the vicinity and under the identical zoning classification;



   (B)   The granting of such variance or modifica-tion will not be
detrimental to the public interest, safety, health or welfare, and will not
be detrimental or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity
and zone in which the property is located;

§ 23.81.010  PURPOSE.



   The City Council finds and declares:



   (A)   Cultural and artistic resources enhance the quality of life
for individuals living in, working in and visiting the city.



   (B)   Balanced development of cultural and artistic resources
preserves and improves the quality of the urban environment and increases
real property values.



   (C)   Cultural and artistic resources are an important aspect of
educating and enhancing the community of the City, and supporting outside art
projects such as the Pasadena Rose Parade Float help to serve this goal.



   (D)   As development and revitalization of the real property within
the City continues, the opportunity for creation of cultural and artistic
resources is diminished.



   (E)   As this development and revitalization continues as a result
of market forces, urbanization of the community results.



   (F)   As these opportunities are diminished and this urbanization
occurs, the need to develop alternative sources for cultural and artistic
outlets to improve the environment, image and character of the community is
increased.



   (G)   Development of cultural and artistic assets should be financed
by those whose development and revitalization diminishes the availability of
the community’s resources for those opportunities and contributes to
community urbanization.



   (H)   Establishment of this Arts in Public Places Program will
promote the general welfare through balancing the community’s physical
growth and revitalization and its cultural and artistic resources.

§ 23.81.140  CRITERIA FOR APPROVING ARCHITECTURE AS ART.



   The following criteria shall be used to determine, on a case-by-case
basis, whether architecture can be considered art for purposes of fulfilling
the city's public art requirement.



   (A)   The architect shall be substantially recognized by the art
world in shows, museums, and/or publications.



   (B)   When reviewing architecture as art, the underlying concept of
the architecture shall be expressive as more than mere utilitarian
architecture. The architecture as a whole or certain architectural features
shall express ideas or meaning and have cultural significance or conceptual
complexity in relation to the totality of the object.



   (C)   In the alternative, architecture can be considered art if it
is created as a collaborative effort with an artist, the artist does a
majority of the work, the artist has major design control of the portions of
the architecture to be considered art, and the artist has been brought in
early in the process. The artist shall have experience and knowledge of
monumental scale sculpture.



   (D)   The architecture must meet all the general criteria regarding
placement of artwork on private property as defined in §§ 23.81.080 et seq.
of this code.



(Ord. 4417, passed 9-10-01)



§ 23.81.150  PROCEDURE FOR APPROVING ARCHITECTURE AS ART.



   The following procedure must be followed by the developer to fill the
public art requirement with the building's architecture.



   (A)   A developer must make two presentations to the City Arts
Committee:



      (1)   The first presentation shall be made prior to the
development application being deemed complete. The developer must submit a
maquette and other materials which satisfactorily illustrate the proposed
conceptual development. The developer and architect must submit a conceptual
statement expressing why the architecture should be considered art, including
an explanation of the ideas, meaning, cultural significance or conceptual
complexity expressed in the architecture.



      (2)   The second presentation shall be made at the completion
of the city approval process. The developer must then submit a maquette and
other materials which satisfactorily illustrate the to-be-built development.



      (3)   If a development application was received prior to the
adoption of this section, the above requirements for the timing of a
developer's presentations to the City Arts Committee shall not apply,
provided the first presentation is made at the Planning Commission meeting at
which the project's approval is considered.



   (B)   The developer and architect shall demonstrate that there will
be high quality materials and craftsmanship used in the execution of the
construction.



   (C)   If all of the foregoing criteria are met, the City Arts
Committee shall make the recommendation to accept the architecture as art,
only if, in its judgment, the architectural work is of extremely high
artistic merit and would make a substantial cultural contribution to the city.



   (D)   The developer and/or architect shall have the responsibility
to demonstrate that all of the foregoing criteria are met.

study and evaluate less intrusive alternatives, including the use of less
intrusive technologies and equipment; alternative system designs; alternative
siting structure types; alternative siting structure design, including
stealth designs; alternative scale or size of proposal; and alternative
siting options (e.g., alternative locations within the search ring,
collocation opportunities or placement upon alternative siting structures);



      (5)   In comparison to other identified, studied, and
evaluated alternatives that are equally if not more capable of addressing the
applicant’s service objectives, the proposal to be approved is the most
consistent with the standards, goals, and objectives of this chapter and the
Alhambra General Plan;

which are intended to address gaps in network coverage, an identified
alternative shall be considered equally capable of addressing the
applicant’s service objectives in comparison to the applicant's requested
proposal, if such an alternative is capable of reducing the purported gap in
network coverage to a de minimis level.



   (D)   Findings necessary for denial of personal wireless service
facilities. Notwithstanding any other findings made in support of the denial
of a conditional use permit under this chapter, neither the Planning
Commission nor the City Council in the course of an appeal, may deny a
conditional use permit unless one or more of the following additional
findings is made in writing:



      (1)   The applicant has failed to present all of the
information, documentation or material required; or



      (2)   Substantial evidence presented as part of the record
fails to establish the existence of a significant gap in personal wireless
service coverage within the personal wireless service network of a personal
wireless service provider applicant or co-applicant; or



      (3)   Notwithstanding the existence of a significant gap in
personal wireless service coverage within the applicant’s coverage network,
substantial evidence presented upon the record fails to establish that of all
reasonably feasible alternatives capable of reducing the coverage gap to a de
minimis level, the proposal for which a conditional use permit is sought is
the least intrusive upon the goals and standards of this chapter and the
Alhambra General Plan; or



      (4)   Substantial evidence presented as part of the record
fails to establish that any proposed wireless facility, wireless transmission
device or accessory equipment is capable of satisfying basic FCC
requirements, limits or restrictions concerning radio frequency emissions or
signal interference with consumer electronic products and/or public safety
communications even with modifications and/or added conditions acceptable to
the applicant; or



      (5)   Substantial evidence presented as part of the record
fails to establish that any proposed wireless facility, wireless transmission
device, support structure or accessory equipment is capable of satisfying
applicable building, construction, fire safety or fire prevention standards
set forth under Title 20 (Building and Construction) of the Alhambra
Municipal Code, the County of Los Angeles or the state of California even
with modifications and/or added conditions acceptable to the applicant.

a public nuisance, as defined by Cal. Civ. Code § 3480, does not exist,
including but not limited to adverse impacts of odors or the use or storage
of hazardous materials, processes, products, or wastes.



   (H)   A portable, working, fire extinguisher must be kept in the
same room or structure where cannabis cultivation is occurring.



   (I)   Cannabis and cannabis infused products must be disposed in a
secure waste receptacle located on the residential property. Disposed
cannabis plants and products must be rendered unusable and unrecognizable by
grinding and incorporating cannabis waste with any non-consumable solid waste
with a resulting mixture of at least 50% non-cannabis waste.

§ 23.88.010  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.



   (A)   Intent and purpose. This Chapter is established to recognize
oaks, and other California native and mature trees as significant aesthetic
and ecological resources and to create favorable conditions for the
preservation and propagation of plant heritage for the benefit of the current
and future residents of the city. It is the intent of this chapter to
maintain and enhance the public health, safety and welfare through the
mitigation of soil erosion and air pollution. It is also the intent of this
chapter to preserve and enhance property values through conserving and
enhancing the distinctive and unique aesthetic character of many areas in the
city.



   (B)   Scope.



      (1)   No protected trees as herein defined shall be removed or
damaged except in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The
provisions of this chapter shall apply to all protected trees on all private
property in all zoning districts, except in the rear and side yards of single
family residential dwellings of R-1 and R-2 zoning districts, whether vacant,
undeveloped, in the process of development or developed. Protected trees
shall not be topped or trimmed except as allowed in the exceptions in
division (B)(2) below. Pruning shall not be subject to a tree permit unless,
in the opinion of the Community Development Director or designee, the work is
so extensive as to constitute trimming, topping, or otherwise damage the tree.



      (2)   Exceptions. The following are exempt from the provisions
of this chapter:



         (a)   Combined permit. A separate tree permit is not
required when a tree removal is requested as part of an entitlement
application. However, all other provisions of this chapter apply and must be
considered by the Planning Commission as part of the combined development
permit.



         (b)   Emergency situation. Cases of emergency where the
Community Development Director or the Director of Public Works or their
designees, or any member of a law enforcement agency or Fire Department, in
the performance of his or her duties, determines that protected tree poses an
imminent threat to the public safety, or general welfare.



         (c)   Visual barriers. Removal or relocation of
protected trees necessary to obtain adequate line-of-sight distances for
traffic safety as required by the Community Development Director or the
Director of Public Works Services or their designees.



         (d)   Public property and public utilities. Removal or
trimming of trees for the protection of any public property or public utility
property that is undertaken by authority of the city, any other public agency
having jurisdiction, or any public utility.



         (e)   Routine trimming. Normal and routine trimming or
pruning which does not result in damage or death to a tree. Removal of
deadwood is allowed without a permit.



         (f)   Fruit trees. Any fruit tree may be trimmed or
removed without a permit.



         (g)   Palm trees. Any palm tree, except as listed as
California native, may be trimmed or removed without a permit.



(Ord. 4737, passed 7-23-18)

   (A)   General. This section provides definitions of the technical
and other terms and phrases used in



this chapter as a means of providing consistency in its interpretation. Where
any definition in this section may conflict with definitions in other titles
of the Alhambra Municipal Code, these definitions shall prevail for the
purposes of this Code. If a word is not defined in this section or in other
provisions of the Municipal Code, the most common dictionary definition is
presumed to be correct.

      DAMAGE. Any action undertaken which causes injury, death, or
disfigurement to a protected tree. This includes, but is not limited to,
cutting, poisoning, overwatering, topping, trimming, relocating or
transplanting a protected tree.



      DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. An application to use, alter, construct upon,
or otherwise change the use of land or a structure.



      MULTI-TRUNK. Any tree with multiple trunks attributed to a single
tree. For purposes of determining the diameter of a multi-trunk tree, the
diameter of each trunk shall be measured at a point four and one-half feet
above the root crown, and the sum of the diameters shall be the diameter of
the tree.



      PROTECTED TREES. Includes the following:



         (a)   Quercus family trees (oaks) and California native
trees taller than 15 feet, or with a trunk diameter larger than 12 inches in
diameter, or 36 inches in circumference, measured at a point four and
one-half feet above the root crown.



         (b)   Mature tree: A tree taller than 20 feet or with a
trunk diameter larger 24  inches  in  diameter, or 75 inches in
circumference, measured at a point four and one-half feet above the root
crown.



      PRUNING (also known as LACING). The removal of selected branches
that are dead, a hazard to public or property, or are otherwise selected for
removal while preserving the overall form of the tree. Pruning can be done to
give a tree a more balanced appearance, to reduce the weight on one side of a
tree in order to prevent the tree from toppling, or to remove branches that
are at risk of breaking and injuring people or damaging property. Utilities
may use pruning to selectively remove branches that interfere with overhead
lines. PRUNING is distinct from topping or trimming a tree.



      REMOVAL. The uprooting, cutting, or severing of the main trunk,
of a protected tree.



      ROOT CROWN. That portion of a protected tree trunk from which
roots extend laterally into the ground.



      TOPPING. The removal of the uppermost branches of a tree, or
cutting the trunk, in order to reduce its height without regard to the
overall form of the tree. Typically results in a horizontal cut across the
trunk or a roughly spherical cut centered on the trunk.



      TRIMMING. The alteration of the outward shape of a tree without
regard to which branches are to be trimmed. Typically results in a geometric
rather than natural shape. Hedges are trimmed to preserve a particular,
frequently rectangular, shape. Topping a tree would be an extreme example of
TRIMMING.



      UNDEVELOPED PROPERTY. Land which is in its natural, original, or
pristine state.



      VACANT PROPERTY. Land on which no buildings or improvements have
been erected or orchards planted but which may have been graded for drainage
or other purposes.

   24.04.020   Policy



   24.04.030   Policy implementation



§ 24.04.010  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.



   A municipal solar and conservation utility is hereby established for
the purpose of conserving and promoting the conservation of available energy
resources.



('86 Code, § 24.04.010) (Ord. 3916, passed  - - )



§ 24.04.020  POLICY.



   (A)   The welfare of the city's residents has been jeopardized in
the past by shortages of natural gas, petroleum propane and electric power.
The shortage of available energy supplies will continue during the coming
decade unless measures are established to conserve the energy available for
the economy and the residents of the city. It is declared to be the policy of
the city to encourage and promote the use of solar energy in order to prevent
or reduce an adverse impact upon the economy of the city and in order to
prevent interruption of employment of the residents of the city in commerce
and industry and in order to prevent injury to the health and welfare of the
residents of the city due to the shortage and high cost of energy in their
homes and places of work.



   (B)   It is also declared to be the policy of the city to improve
the economics of solar energy use by facilitating the leasing of solar energy
devices. This policy is premised on a finding that the initial cost of
purchasing and installing a solar energy device is the primary economic
barrier to expanded solar energy use. California law currently provides that
taxpayers who lease a solar energy system from a municipal utility or from
any lessor granted a permit from a municipal solar utility shall receive a
tax credit for the first three years of operation or until the solar tax
credit allowance terminates, whichever comes first.



   (C)   It is further declared to be the policy of the city to provide
consumer protection measures for resi-dents who lease solar energy systems
through the municipal solar and conservation utility.



('86 Code, § 24.04.020) (Ord. 3916, passed  - - )



§ 24.04.030  POLICY IMPLEMENTATION.



   The energy coordinator shall establish rules and regulations designed
to implement the policies set forth in § 24.04.020 hereof. Such rules and
regulations shall be known as the “Alhambra municipal solar and
conservation utility.”

CHAPTER 24.06:  MSCU SOLAR
LEASING PROGRAM



Section



   24.06.010   Establishment and purpose



   24.06.020   Permit required and fee therefor



   24.06.030   Duties of energy coordinator



   24.06.040   Inspection of applicant's financial records



   24.06.050   Consumer protection measures



§ 24.06.010  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.



   (A)   A municipal solar and conservation utility solar leasing
program is hereby established for the purpose of regulating the leasehold
marketing of solar energy devices within the city.



   (B)   California law currently encourages the leasehold marketing of
solar energy devices within the state of California by providing tax credits
to California taxpayers who lease such devices from a municipal utility or
from any lessor granted a permit from a municipal solar utility. Upon the
establishment of the Alhambra municipal solar and conservation utility,
residents of the city who lease solar energy devices through such utility
should be able to obtain such tax credits. However, as legal title to such
solar energy devices is held by a person other than the resident-user, the
latter is particularly susceptible to harm caused by consumer deception,
safety hazards and the interruption of service. To help prevent such harm
from occurring and to promote the economic feasibility of solar energy use
within the city, lease-hold interests of solar energy devices may be marketed
within the city's jurisdiction by complying with the provisions of this
chapter and any rules and regulations promulgated by the energy coordinator
to implement any provisions of this chapter.



('86 Code, § 24.06.010) (Ord. 3916, passed  - - )

   (B)   Fee.  The City Council shall set by resolu-tion the fee for
the permit required by division (A) hereof.



   (C)   The applicant shall provide all information necessary to
comply with the provisions of this chapter and shall pay such fee to the
energy coordinator at the time of issuance of such permit.
