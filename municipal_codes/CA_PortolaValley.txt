PORTOLA VALLEY MUNICIPAL CODE 1983 
  A Codification of the General Ordinances 
of the Town of Portola Valley, California 
  Codified, Indexed and Published by 
 
> 
PREFACE 
The Portola Valley, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1983, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance list, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification. 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2019-432, passed May 8, 2019.

CHAPTER 1.12 - CODE COMPLIANCE—JUDICIAL AND 
Sections: 
 
1.12.010 - Purpose. 
The town council finds that compliance with the municipal code and applicable state codes throughout the town is an important public service and enables the town to better implement its general plan. Code compliance is vital to protection of the public's health, safety, and quality of life. The council finds that its citizens have a right to expect effective code compliance without confrontation between neighbors. The council further finds that a comprehensive code compliance system that uses a combination of judicial and administrative remedies is critical to gain compliance with code regulations. 
The council adopts the following basic principles to guide the town's code compliance process: 
A.  It is the sole responsibility of the property owner and his/her builder or contractor or other responsible person to understand and comply with all applicable provisions of the Portola Valley Municipal Code. 
B.  The town has a duty and responsibility to investigate and enforce code violations in order to obtain compliance with municipal code provisions. 
C.  When a municipal code violation is discovered, any related work activity must cease immediately. 
D.  No town official has the authority to waive the need for a permit required by the municipal code unless expressly given that right by the municipal code or a court order. 
E.  When a municipal code violation occurs, the property owner responsible shall be liable for the town's costs of obtaining compliance with the town's regulations. 
(Ord. 1998-309 § 2 (part), 1998)  
1.12.020 - Notice of code violations. 
A. In addition to any other remedy for violations of the municipal code provided for in the municipal code, or in any other ordinance of the town, or in the provisions of any code adopted by reference by the municipal code ("code"), whenever the town administrator has knowledge of an alleged violation that relates in any way to the use or occupation of real property within the town, he/she may provide a notice of code violation ("notice") to the owner of the property upon which the alleged violation is located and, where different from the owner, if known, to the person(s) responsible for causing or maintaining such alleged violation. 
B.  The notice shall specify the property address, the owner's name, any responsible party's name, if known, and the nature of the alleged violations, including reference to the pertinent code section(s). The notice shall provide a list of corrections needed to bring the property into compliance and a deadline or specific date to correct the violations. The notice shall also indicate the potential consequences should the property remain in violation, including, but not limited to: criminal prosecution; civil injunction; civil penalties; administrative costs; recordation of the notice; and withholding of future permits and inspections. The potential consequences listed should be commensurate with the nature and severity of the alleged violation. 
C.  The notice shall also state that within twenty days after the date of the mailing of the notice, the owner and/or any responsible person may request a meeting with the town administrator to present evidence that a violation does not exist. If a meeting is requested, the town administrator shall arrange to meet with the owner and/or responsible person as soon as possible, but not later than five working days after receipt of the request for a meeting. 
D.  In the event a meeting is not requested and the alleged violation has not been corrected or a corrective plan of action is not approved by the town administrator within twenty days after the date of the mailing of the notice or in the event that, after consideration of evidence, the town administrator determines that one or more violations of the code in fact exists, the town administrator shall issue a notice of intent to record the notice of code violation. The notice of intent shall be provided to the property owner and any responsible party. 
E.  If the owner or the responsible person disagrees with the determination of the town administrator, either party may appeal the decision to the town council by providing a written request to the town clerk or to the town administrator, along with an appeal fee as set forth in the town's fee schedule, not later than fifteen days after the date of the mailing of the notice of intent to record the notice of violation. 
F.  The town council shall, not later than forty-five days after the date an appeal is filed, conduct a hearing to consider the action of the town administrator and the evidence of the appellant. At least fifteen days prior to the hearing, the town shall provide written notice regarding the date and time of the hearing to the affected property owner, any responsible person, if known, and to the property owners of the ten nearest neighboring properties or the property owners of all properties within five hundred feet of the subject property, whichever number is lesser. The town council shall either affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the town administrator and may attach conditions deemed necessary to assure compliance with town regulations and to reimburse the town for the costs of code compliance. 
G.  If no appeal is timely filed, or if directed by the decision of the town council on an appeal, the town administrator may proceed with civil or criminal enforcement remedies and shall record the notice of code violation with the office of the county recorder of San Mateo County. The recorded notice of code violation shall also include the name of the property owner, the assessor's parcel number, and the parcel's legal description. A copy of the notice of code violation shall also be provided by certified mail to the property owner and any responsible person, if known. 
H.  A notice of release of code violation shall be issued by the town administrator only if the town administrator or town council determines that: 
1.  All violations listed in the notice of code violation have been corrected; 
2.  All necessary permits have been issued and finalized; 
3.  All civil penalties have been paid; 
4.  All administrative costs of code compliance have been paid. 
The notice of release of code violation shall be also be recorded if a notice of code violation was previously recorded. 
I.  The town shall cause a stop work notice to be issued for any work related to a code violation, and where a notice of code violation has been recorded, shall withhold permits for any alteration, repair, or construction on the property, or any permits pertaining to the use and development of the real property or any structure on such property until a notice of release of code violation has been issued by the town administrator. The town shall not withhold permits which are necessary to obtain a notice of release of code violation or which are necessary to correct serious health and safety violations. 
J.  Whenever a notice is required to be given under this section, the following provisions apply, unless different provisions are otherwise specifically stated to apply: 
1.  Notice shall be given by personal service or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. Simultaneously, the same notice may be sent by first class (regular) mail. If a notice that is sent by certified mail is returned unsigned, then service shall be deemed effective pursuant to regular mail, provided the notice that was sent by regular mail is not returned. 
2.  Notice to the property owner by mail shall be to the address shown on the last assessment roll or to any other address of the owner known to the town administrator. In the event the owner's address is unknown, notice shall be posted in three places on or in front of the property, in a form to be approved by the town administrator. 
3.  Notice to any known responsible party shall be by mail to the street address of the property or to any other address of the responsible party known to the town administrator. 
4.  Service by personal service or by certified or regular mail in the manner described above shall be effective on the date of personal delivery or the date of mailing. The failure of any person with an interest in the property to receive any notice served in accordance with this section shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this chapter. 
(Ord. 1998-309 § 2 (part), 1998)  
1.12.030 - Mediation. 
A. The council finds there may be a need for mediation as a means of dispute resolution to gain compliance with provisions of the municipal code and other applicable federal and state codes. The council further declares that mediation can be an effective technique to avoid disputes by developing consensus on controversial issues. Mediation can often resolve disputes in a more efficient and effective manner without the necessity of more formal administrative action or litigation. 
B.  At any stage of a code compliance proceeding, including during a civil action, the matter may be referred to mediation by the town or by a court that has jurisdiction over the matter. 
C.  The mediation shall be held before a neutral third party agreed to by the parties or appointed by the court that has jurisdiction over the matter.

(Ord. 1998-309 § 2 (part), 1998)  
1.12.040 - Code compliance cost recovery. 
A. Any property owner to whom a notice of violation is issued and recorded shall pay to the town the costs of staff administration, as set forth in the town's fee schedule. Such costs shall be based on the time of staff involved in abating the violation and may include the costs of research, field investigation, notice, and administrative hearing costs. 
B.  Any person against whom a civil or criminal complaint is filed shall pay to the town the reasonable costs of staff administration, as set forth in the town's fee schedule, unless the party after trial is deemed by the court to be the prevailing party. Such costs shall be based on the time of staff involved in abating the violation and may include the costs of research, field investigation, notice, administrative hearing, and court costs. 
C.  Code compliance administrative costs shall not be required where the violations on a property are corrected before the date of recordation of a notice of code violation. 
D.  No notice of code violation shall be released by the town and no civil or criminal complaint shall be dismissed by the town until all applicable code compliance costs have been paid. Additionally, no permit shall be issued and no staff inspection shall be conducted for work on a property currently subject to a notice of code violation or to a civil or criminal complaint, until such code compliance costs have been paid. 
E.  Code compliance costs shall be required in addition to any other fees or penalties required by the code. 
(Ord. 1998-309 § 2 (part), 1998)  
1.12.050 - Civil penalties—Injunction. 
A. The town council finds that in addition to any other procedures, fines, or penalties, that where it is necessary for the town to file a civil action in court to obtain compliance with the code, the court may, in its discretion, assess a civil penalty of up to five thousand dollars against the violating parties in connection with the code enforcement action in the event the town is the prevailing party. The court shall consider some or all of the following factors: 
1.  The duration of the violation(s). 
2.  The frequency or recurrence of the violation(s). 
3.  The seriousness of the violation(s). 
4.  The history of the violation(s). 
5.  The person's conduct after issuance of the notice of code violation. 
6.  The good faith effort by the person to comply. 
7.  The economic impact of the penalty on the person. 
8.  The impact of the violation upon the community. 
9.  Any other factors that justice may require. 
B.  Any person or entity who commences development or begins construction of any improvement prior to obtaining a zoning approval, architectural and site plan review, subdivision approval, or building permit required by the Portola Valley Municipal Code shall pay a civil penalty to the town equivalent to three times any and all fees required for the development or improvement. The town administrator may reduce or waive the administrative civil penalty fee in those cases where an application for permit is filed prior to staff awareness of a potential violation and may reduce the fee by one-half where the town administrator determines that the applicant has not acted willfully to violate the code, provided that a complete permit application is submitted not later than ten days after staff has notified the owner of the violation. 
C.  Any provision of the code may be enforced by injunction issued by the superior court upon a suit brought by the town. 
D.  As part of any civil court action, the town has the authority to require a performance bond to ensure compliance with the municipal code, applicable state codes, or any judicial action. 
(Ord. 1998-309 § 2 (part), 1998)  
1.12.060 - Violations, misdemeanors or infractions.

3.32.075 - Temporary reduction in general tax and reinstatement of tax without election. 
A. The five and one-half percent general taxes imposed on telephone users set forth in Section 3.32.040, electricity users set forth in Section 3.32.050, gas users set forth in Section 3.32.060, and water users set forth in Section 3.32.070 are each reduced to four and one-half percent for a period of five years from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2023. On July 1, 2023, the tax rate shall automatically revert back to five and one-half percent without voter approval or town council action. 
B.  Beginning on July 1, 2020, the town council may in its absolute discretion, by resolution and upon a majority vote of the council, temporarily further reduce the tax percentage in Sections 3.32.040 through 3.32.070 for a period not to exceed twelve months. The tax administrator shall implement the temporary tax reduction by giving sixty-day written notice to all affected service suppliers as required by Public Utilities Code Section 799. At the end of the temporary tax percentage reduction period, the four and one-half percent rate specified in Section 3.32.075 shall be automatically reinstated without further notice or action by the city council.

D.  As stated in Government Code Section 9611, the enactment of a temporary tax percentage reduction by the town council shall not constitute a repeal of one or more of the original provisions of this chapter. Upon the expiration of the time of the temporary tax percentage reduction, the original provisions of this chapter shall have the same force and effect as if the temporary tax percentage reduction had not been enacted. Nothing herein is intended to constitute a decrease in a tax, or an increase in a tax requiring election approval under California Constitution Article XIIIC; and to the extent that any aspect of a temporary tax percentage reduction is found to invoke such a requirement, the entire temporary tax percentage reduction shall be deemed null and void ab initio, and there shall be no entitlement to such tax reduction for any service user.

3.32.080 - Collection—Procedure. 
The duty to collect and remit the taxes imposed by this chapter shall be performed as follows: 
A.  The tax shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as and along with the charges made in accordance with regular billing practice of the service supplier. Except in those cases where a service user pays the full amount of said charges, but does not pay any portion of a tax imposed by this chapter, if the amount paid by a service user is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which has accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. 
B.  The duty to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to that person which starts on or after the operative date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Where a person receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period. 
(Ord. 1985-207 § 8, 1985)  
3.32.090 - Collection—Actions. 
Any tax and/or penalty required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the tax administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required to collect and remit. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. 
(Ord. 1985-207 § 7, 1985)  
3.32.100 - Recordkeeping by services suppliers. 
It shall be the duty of every service supplier required to collect and remit to the city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax such service supplier may have been required to collect and remit to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Ord. 1985-207 § 14, 1985)  
3.32.110 - Tax administrator—Powers and duties. 
A. The tax administrator shall have the power and duty and is directed to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  The tax administrator shall have power to adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with provisions of this chapter for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of such rules and regulations shall be on file in the tax administrator's office. 
C.  The tax administrator may make administrative agreements to vary the strict requirements of this chapter so that collection of any tax imposed herein may be made in conformance with the billing procedures of a particular service supplier, so long as such agreements result in collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this chapter. A copy of each agreement shall be on file in the tax administrator's office. 
(Ord. 1985-207 § 9, 1985)  
3.32.120 - Late payment collection procedures—Penalty. 
A. Whenever the tax administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by him from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax for a period of four or more billing periods, or that a service user has refused to pay the amount of the tax to such person, or whenever the tax administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he may relieve such person of the obligation to collect taxes due under this chapter from certain named service users for specific billing periods. 
B.  The service supplier shall provide the city with a report of the amounts refused along with the names and addresses of the service users refusing to pay the tax. 
C.  The tax administrator shall notify the service user that he has assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes. The notice shall be served on the service user by handing it to him personally or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have changed his address, to his last known address. If a service user fails to pay the tax to the tax administrator within fifteen days from the date of the service of the notice upon him, which shall be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed, but not less than five dollars. The penalty shall become part of the tax required to be paid. 
(Ord. 1985-207 § 10, 1985)  
3.32.130 - Refunds. 
A. A service supplier who has collected any amount of tax illegally, erroneously, or more than once may refund such amount to the service user and claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly returns, providing such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than three years from the date of overpayment. 
B.  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded to a service supplier or service user by the city, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specified grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records, and, in the case of a service user, that the service user has been unable to obtain a refund or adjustment from the service supplier who collected the tax. 
C.  Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, whenever a service supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, makes a refund to service users of charges for past utility services, the taxes paid pursuant to this chapter on the amount of such refunded service charges may also be refunded to service users by the service supplier, and the service supplier can claim credit for such refunded taxes against the amount which is due upon any monthly returns. In the event this chapter is repealed, amounts of any refundable taxes will be borne by the city. 
(Ord. 1985-207 § 11, 1985)  
3.32.140 - Operative date. 
The five and one-half percent tax imposed under this chapter shall be applied to bills issued for billing periods beginning on or after the 1st day of July 1994.

CHAPTER 8.09 - RECYCLING AND DIVERSION OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION DEBRIS[2] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. 2000-332, § 1, adopted in 2000, enacted provisions to be incorporated as chapter 8.10. Inasmuch as chapter 8.10 already exists, said provisions have been redesignated as chapter 8.09, §§ 8.09.010—8.09.120, at the discretion of the editor. 
 
8.09.010 - Findings and purpose 
A. The town council finds that the state of California through its California Waste Management Act of 1989, Assembly Bill 939 (AB 939), requires that each local jurisdiction in the state divert fifty percent of solid waste from landfill by December 31, 2000, through source reduction, recycling, and composting activities. 
B.  The town council finds that the California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen) includes new provisions effective January 1, 2017 that increase the required diversion rate to sixty-five percent. 
C.  The town council finds that with Assembly Bill 341 (AB 341) the state of California made a legislative declaration in regard to AB 939 that it is the policy goal of the state that not less than seventy-five percent of solid waste generated be source reduced, recycled, or composted by the year 2020. 
D.  The town council finds that every city and county in California could face fines up to ten thousand dollars a day for not meeting the above-mandated goal. 
E.  The town council finds and determines that the town is committed to protecting the public health, safety, welfare and environment. 
F.  In order to meet these goals, it is necessary that the town promote the reduction of solid waste and reduce the stream of solid waste going to landfills. 
G.  Debris from demolition and construction of buildings represents a significant portion of the volume presently going to landfill(s) from Portola Valley and much of said debris is particularly suitable for recycling. 
H.  The town council finds that reuse and recycling of certain portions of construction and demolition debris is essential to further the town's efforts to reduce solid waste, to comply with AB 939 mandates and the 2016 California Green Building Standards Code, and to work toward AB 341 mandates. 
I.  The town council finds that, except in unusual circumstances, it is feasible to divert an average of at least seventy-five percent of all construction and demolition debris from construction, demolition and renovation covered projects. 
J.  The town council recognizes that requiring construction and demolition debris to be recycled and reused may in some respects add modestly to the cost of demolition and in other respects may make possible some cost recovery and cost reduction. 
K.  It is necessary in order to protect the public's health, safety and welfare, that the following regulations be adopted. 
(Ord. 2017-415 § 1, 2017; Ord. 2000-332 § 1 (part), 2000)

(Ord. 2017-415, § 2, 2017; Ord. 2000-332 § 1 (part), 2000; Ord. 2002-340 § 1 (part), 2002)  
8.09.030 - Deconstruction and salvage and recovery. 
Every covered project shall be made available for deconstruction, salvage, and recovery prior to demolition. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to recover the maximum feasible amount of salvageable designated recyclable and reusable materials prior to demolition. In order to provide sufficient time for deconstruction and salvage and recovery to be undertaken, no demolition may commence until a period of five working days has elapsed from the date of issuance of the demolition permit. Recovered and salvaged designated recyclable and reusable material from the covered project shall qualify to be counted in meeting the diversion requirements of this chapter. Recovered or salvaged designated recyclable and reusable materials may be given away or sold on the premises, or may be removed to reuse warehouse facilities for storage or sale. 
(Ord. 2000-332 § 1 (part), 2000)  
8.09.040 - Diversion requirements. 
It is required that at least seventy-five percent of the waste tonnage of construction and demolition debris generated from every covered project shall be diverted from landfill by using recycling, salvage for reuse and diversion programs: 
Notwithstanding, should town staff determine that more than twenty-five percent of project debris primarily consists of non-recyclable material and that the applicant has made a good faith attempt to meet, but cannot meet the seventy-five percent diversion requirement, town staff may grant an exception from the diversion requirements for the non-recyclable material only as long as all of the recyclable material is one hundred percent diverted. 
In those cases where town staff has determined that the applicant has made a good faith effort to recycle or reuse the material and no recycling or reuse market may be found for that certain material, then alternative daily cover (ADC) may be considered as bona fide diversion for the materials for which there is no recycling or reuse market. 
The town believes in the highest and best use of materials that are recycled. Therefore, ADC alone shall not count towards reaching the required diversion percentage. 
(Ord. 2017-415, § 3, 2017; Ord. 2000-332 § 1 (part), 2000; Ord. 2001-335 § 1 (part), 2001; Ord. 2002-340 § 2 (part), 2002)  
8.09.050 - Information required before issuance of demolition and/or building permit. 
Every applicant shall submit a properly completed waste management plan, in a form as prescribed by the WMP compliance official to the WMP compliance official, as a portion of the building or demolition permit process and shall be in conformance with items 1. through 8., below. The completed WMP shall be updated as necessary and shall be available during construction for examination by the enforcing agency indicate all of the following: 
1.  Identify the construction and demolition waste materials to be diverted from disposal by efficient usage, recycling, reuse on the project or salvage for future reuse or sale. 
2.  Calculate the estimated volume or weight of construction and demolition waste materials, by material type, to be generated; 
3.  Identify the maximum volume or weight of such materials that can feasibly be diverted via reuse or recycling; 
4.  Identify the estimated volume or weight of construction and demolition debris that will be land filled; 
5.  Specify if construction and demolition waste materials will be sorted on-site (source-separated) or bulk mixed (single stream); 
6.  Identify the vendor that the applicant proposes to use to haul the materials, the facility to which the materials will be hauled, and the facility's requirement for diversion of the materials; and 
7.  Identify construction methods employed to reduce the amount of construction and demolition waste generated. 
8.  Calculate the total diversion rate of all materials at the end of the project. 
In estimating the volume or weight of materials identified in the WMP, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the town for this purpose. Approval of the form as complete and accurate shall be a condition precedent to issuance of any building or demolition permit. If the maximum volume or weight of such materials that can feasibly be diverted via reuse or recycling, as estimated pursuant to item 3. above, is less than the required diversion requirements, applicant must submit information that supports the lower projected diversion rate, or the WMP shall be considered to be incomplete. 
(Ord. 2017-415 § 4, 2017; Ord. 2000-332 § 1 (part), 2000; Ord. 2002-340 § 3 (part), 2002)  
8.09.060 - Deposit required. 
As a condition precedent to issuance of any permit for a construction or building for a covered project, the applicant shall post a cash deposit in the amount of fifty dollars for each estimated ton of demolition debris from a covered demolition or renovation project, and one-half percent of total project valuation for new construction projects, but not less than one thousand dollars (the deposit). Soil debris shall be treated in the manner as any other debris, unless the applicant has more than one hundred tons of soil debris in which case the total deposit for the soil debris shall be capped at five thousand dollars. The deposit shall be returned, without interest, in total or pro rated, upon proof to the satisfaction of the WMP compliance official that no less than the required percentages of the waste tonnage of construction and demolition debris generated by the covered project have been diverted from landfills and have been recycled or reused or stored for later reuse or recycling. If a lesser percentage of waste tonnage of construction and demolition debris than required is diverted, a proportionate share of the deposit will be returned. The deposit shall be forfeited entirely or to the pro rated extent that there is a failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The town council may, by formal resolution, modify the amount of the required deposit. 
(Ord. 2000-332 § 1 (part), 2000; Ord. 2001-335 § 2 (part), 2001; Ord. 2002-340 § 4 (part), 2002)  
8.09.070 - Administrative fee. 
As a condition precedent to issuance of any permit for construction or demolition for a covered project, the applicant shall pay to the town a cash fee sufficient to compensate the town for all expenses incurred in administering the permit. The amount of the fee shall be determined in accordance with the then current fee schedule adopted by resolution of the town council. 
(Ord. 2017-415 § 5, 2017; Ord. 2000-332 § 1 (part), 2000)  
8.09.080 - On-Site practices. 
During the term of the covered project, the applicant shall recycle or reuse the required percentages of materials, and keep records of the tonnage or the other measurements approved by the WMP compliance official that can be converted to tonnage. The WMP compliance official will evaluate and monitor each covered project to gauge the percentage of materials recycled, salvaged and recycled or reused from the covered project. The required diversion of a minimum of the required percentages of the designated recyclable and reusable materials shall be measured separately with respect to the demolition segment and the construction segment of a covered project where both construction and demolition are involved. To the maximum extent feasible, each of the seven categories of designated recyclable and reusable materials, as set forth in 8.09.020 [K], shall be separated on-site, and separately transported to a processor, in order to permit maximum diversion. For deconstruction and/or demolition projects, on-site separation shall include salvageable materials (appliances, fixtures, plumbing, etc.,) and dimensional lumber. For all other construction projects on-site separation shall include dimensional lumber, wallboard and cardboard. 
(Ord. 2000-332 § 1 (part), 2000)  
8.09.090 - Reporting. 
Within sixty days following the completion of the demolition phase of a covered project, and again within sixty days following the completion of the construction phase of a covered project, the applicant shall, as a condition precedent to final inspection and to issuance of any certificate of occupancy, submit documentation to the WMP compliance official which proves compliance with the requirements of Sections 8.09.030 and 8.09.040. The documentation shall consist of a final completed "Waste Management Plan" showing actual data of waste tonnage, supported by originals or certified photocopies of receipts and weight tags or other records of measurement from recycling companies, deconstruction contractors, and/or landfill and disposal companies. Receipts and weight tags will be used to verify whether materials generated from the site have been or are to be recycled, reused, salvaged or otherwise disposed of. The applicant shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all designated recyclable and reuse materials salvaged or landfilled are measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all construction and demolition debris shall be weighed by measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition debris for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the town for this purpose. 
If a covered project involves both demolition and construction, the report and documentation for the demolition project must be submitted and approved by the WMP compliance official before issuance of a building permit for the construction phase of a covered project. In the alternative, the applicant may submit a letter stating that no waste or recyclable materials were generated from the covered project, in which case this statement shall be subject to verification by the WMP compliance official. Any deposit posted pursuant to Section 8.05.050, shall be forfeited if the applicant does not meet the timely reporting requirements of this section. 
(Ord. 2000-332 § 1 (part), 2000)

The applicant shall submit a written request and shall provide all documentation and information required by the town engineer to determine whether application of the provision in question will prohibit any economically viable use of the land in question or otherwise have an impermissible confiscatory result. 
C.  The town engineer may approve, deny, or conditionally approve a waiver application upon making all of the following written findings: 
1.  That the application of the provision for which a waiver or modification is sought would result in the denial of substantially all economically viable use of the real property in question; 
2.  To the extent feasible, conditions have been placed upon such a waiver or modification in order to achieve the goals of this chapter as closely as possible while still allowing economically viable use of the real property in question; 
3.  Approval of such a waiver will not result in a public nuisance which would constitute a significant threat to public health or safety. 
D.  Any decision of the town engineer shall be appealable to the town council. 
(Ord. 1998-308 § 2 (part), 1998)

Any such waiver shall be authorized under a procedure approved by the town council, which may or may not include notice and hearing. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the grantor.

(b)  The procedures for compliance documentation shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Preliminary Documentation. Applicants for a covered project are encouraged, but not required, to meet with the planning director or his/her designee, in advance of submittal of an application, to determine required green building thresholds for compliance and to review the proposed green building program and details to achieve compliance. 
(2)  Discretionary Planning Entitlements. Upon submittal of an application for any discretionary planning entitlement for any covered project, including, but not limited to, architectural review, site development permit, conditional use permit, or variance requests, application materials shall include the appropriate completed checklists, as required by the standards for compliance specified in Section 15.10.040, accompanied by a text description of the proposed green building program and expected measures and milestones for compliance. 
(3)  Building Plan Check Review. Upon submittal of an application for a building permit, building plans for any covered project shall include a checklist and green building program description, reflecting any changes proposed since the planning entitlement phase (if a planning entitlement was required). The checklist shall be incorporated onto a separate plan sheet included with the building plans. A qualified green building professional shall provide evidence of adequate green building compliance or documentation to the planning director or his/her designee to satisfy the requirements of the standards for compliance outlined in Section 15.10.040, prior to issuance of a building permit. 
(4)  Final Building Inspection, Verification, and Occupancy. Prior to final building inspection and occupancy for any covered project, a qualified building professional shall provide evidence of adequate green building compliance or documentation to the director or his/her designee to satisfy the requirements of the standards for compliance outlined in Section 15.10.040. This information shall include, but is not limited to: 
(i)  Documentation that verifies incorporation of the design and construction related credits specified in the project approval for the covered project; 
(ii)  A letter from the qualified green building professional that certifies that the covered project has been constructed in accordance with the approved green building project checklist; 
(iii)  Any additional documentation that would be required by the GreenPoint rated manuals for GreenPoint rated certification (if required); and 
(iv)  Any additional information that the applicant believes is relevant to determining that a good faith effort has been made to comply with this chapter. 
(5)  Final Determination of Compliance and Good Faith Effort to Comply. Prior to the scheduling of a final building inspection for a covered project, the planning director or his/her designee shall review the documentation submitted by the applicant, and determine whether the applicant has achieved the required compliance threshold as set forth in the standards for compliance outlined in Section 15.10.040 and/or demonstrate that measures are in place to assure compliance not later than one year after approval of final building inspection. If the planning director or his/her designee determines that the applicant has met the requirements of Section 15.10.040 for the project, the final building inspection may proceed, provided the covered project has received approval of all other inspections required by the chief building official. If the planning director or his/her designee determines that the required green building rating has not been achieved, the planning director or his/her designee shall find one of the following: 
(i)  Good Faith Effort to Comply. When an applicant submits a request in writing to the planning director or his/her designee for approval of a good faith effort to comply, the planning director or his/her designee shall determine that the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter when finding that either a) the cost for providing green building documentation or assuring compliance is disproportionate to the overall cost of the project, or b) the green building materials and technologies on the green building checklist are no longer available or not yet commercially available, or c) at least eighty percent of the required green point credits have been achieved, and measures are in place to assure full compliance not later than one year after approval of the final building inspection. Determination of a good faith effort to comply shall be made separately for each item on the green building project checklist. Granting of a good faith effort to comply for one item does not preclude the need for the applicant to comply with the other items on the green building checklist. 
(ii)  Non-Compliant Project. If the planning director or his/her designee determines that the applicant has not made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation required within the required time period, then the project shall be determined to be non-compliant, and the final inspection and approval for the project shall be withheld. A final inspection shall not take place until the applicant has implemented equivalent alternate measures approved by the planning director or his/her. 
(6)  Non-Compliance. If, upon inspection, the building official or planning director determines that the covered project does not comply with the approved plans or green building checklist, a stop order shall be issued if the planning director or his/her designee determines that continuation of construction activities will jeopardize the project's ability to meet the required compliance threshold. The stop order shall remain in effect until project has been brought into compliance with the approved plans and/or checklist. 
(c)  The planning director or his/her designee shall have the responsibility to administer and monitor compliance with the green building requirements set forth in this chapter and with any rules and regulations promulgated. 
(d)  Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be listed as a condition of approval on any architectural and site control review or other discretionary permit approval, and on the building plans for building permit approval, for any covered project.

The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted to promote public safety and the general public welfare, to protect property against loss from erosion, earth movement and flooding, to promote and enhance a superior community environment, to maintain the rural character, to maintain air quality and ecologic balance, to maintain property values, to preserve historical value, and to ensure the maximum preservation of the natural scenic character of major portions of the town by establishing minimum standards and requirements relating to land grading, excavations and fills, protection of trees, installation of driveways and procedures by which these standards and requirements may be enforced. It is intended that this chapter be administered with the foregoing purposes in mind and specifically so as to: 
A.  Ensure that the development of each site occurs in a manner harmonious with adjacent lands so as to minimize problems of drainage, erosion, earth movement and similar hazards as well as visually unpleasant relationships; 
B.  Ensure that public lands and places, watercourses, streets and all other lands in the town are not subject to erosion and the hazard of earth movement or faulty drainage; 
C.  Ensure that the planning, design and construction of any project will be done in a manner which provides both maximum safety and human enjoyment, while making it as unobtrusive in the natural terrain as possible; 
D.  Ensure, insofar as practical in permitting reasonable development of land and minimizing fire hazard, the maximum retention of natural vegetation to aid in protection against erosion, earth movement and other similar hazards and to aid in preservation of natural scenic qualities of the town; 
E.  Protect significant trees in order to retain as many trees as possible consistent with the purposes set forth herein and also consistent with reasonable economic enjoyment of private property; 
F.  Ensure that the planning, design and construction of any project is consistent with the general plan, any specific plans and Title 18 of this code.

15.12.040 - Interpretation. 
This chapter shall be interpreted and applied as follows: 
A.  The provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, except where they are expressly stated to be maximum requirements. The chapter is not intended to impair or interfere with any private restrictions placed upon property by covenant or deed; provided, however, that where this chapter imposes higher standards or greater restrictions upon the development of land than are imposed or required by such private restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall control. 
B.  Whenever any provision of this chapter and any other provision of law, whether set forth in this chapter or in any other law, ordinance or resolution of any kind, impose overlapping or contradictory regulations over the development of land, or contain any restrictions covering any of the same subject matter, that provision which is more restrictive or imposes higher standards or requirements shall govern. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7103), 1984)  
15.12.050 - Hazards. 
Whenever the town engineer determines that any existing excavation or embankment or fill on private property has become a hazard to life and limb, endangers other property, or adversely affects the safety, use or stability of a public way or drainage channel, he shall notify the owners of such property or other person or agent in control of the property. Upon receipt of notice in writing from the town engineer or his authorized representative, the owner or agent shall within the period specified in the notice repair or eliminate such excavation or embankment so as to eliminate the hazard and be in conformance with the requirements of this chapter. 
In case of emergency, when a tree is hazardous or dangerous to life or property, it may be trimmed or removed by order of a member of a utility company, a member of a police or fire department, or town staff, all acting in official capacity.

A.  Grading Work Under One Hundred Cubic Yards. Where the aggregate volume of grading on any site or contiguous group of sites is in excess of fifty cubic yards but not over one hundred cubic yards, the planning coordinator shall process the application according to the appropriate alternate listed below: 
1.  When the application is attendant to a building permit, the application shall be referred to the town engineer, town geologist, town planner, and any other appropriate staff for review and report. The reports shall be submitted to the town planner for inclusion in a report to the ASCC along with the building permit application. After review of the reports, the ASCC may approve the permit with such reasonable conditions as it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this chapter and direct that the permit be issued. The planning coordinator shall issue the permit in the form of a letter to the applicant. 
2.  When the application is not attendant to a building permit, the application shall be referred to the town engineer, town geologist, town planner, and any other appropriate staff for review and report. The planning coordinator shall compile the recommendations and submit them in a report to the town engineer. After review of the report, the town engineer may approve the permit with such reasonable conditions as he or she deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this chapter and direct that the permit be issued. The planning coordinator shall issue the permit in the form of a letter to the applicant. Alternatively, the town engineer may direct that the application be referred to the planning commission in the manner provided for in subsection C of this section. Any review costs resulting from such referral shall be paid for by the applicant. 
B.  Grading Work of At Least One Hundred Cubic Yards But Not Over One Thousand Cubic Yards, Or Where Cuts Or Fills Exceed Five Feet. Where the aggregate volume of grading on any site or contiguous group of sites amounts to at least one hundred cubic yards but is not over one thousand cubic yards, or where proposed cuts or fills exceed five feet at their maximum point, the application shall be referred to the town engineer, town geologist, town planner, and other appropriate members of the site development committee for review and report. The reports shall be submitted to the town planner for inclusion in a report to the ASCC. Notice of the ASCC meeting at which the application will be considered shall be given as required by Section 18.64.085 of this code. After review of the report, the ASCC may approve the permit with such reasonable conditions as it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this chapter and direct that the permit be issued. The planning coordinator shall issue the permit in the form of a letter to the applicant. 
C.  Grading Work in Excess of One Thousand Cubic Yards or Removal of Vegetation or Both. Where the aggregate volume of grading on any site or contiguous group of sites is in excess of one thousand cubic yards, or where approval to remove vegetation is required by Section 15.12.070, the following procedures shall apply: 
1.  The application shall be referred to the site development committee for review. The designated members of the architectural and site control commission, the conservation committee and trails committee may in turn refer the application to their respective entire committees. 
2.  Following such review, site development committee members shall each provide written reports to the town planner who shall, based on these reports, prepare a final report with recommendations to be forwarded to the planning commission and the applicant. The report shall include or reference copies of all written reports submitted by site development committee members. 
3.  The planning commission shall hold a hearing on the application for the proposed site development permit, and, before holding such hearing, notices shall be sent to neighboring property owners as required by Section 18.70.040 of this code and to such other additional owners as, in the opinion of the town planner, may be substantially affected by such grading operation. 
4.  Upon completion of the required hearings and after consideration of the report and recommendations of the site development committee, the planning commission shall approve, approve with such reasonable conditions as it may deem necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this chapter, or disapprove the application for the site development permit. The planning coordinator shall issue the permit in the form of a letter to the applicant. 
5.  Failure of the planning commission to make a determination upon the approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the application for a site development permit within sixty days after receipt of all necessary information for such action will constitute an approval of the application unless such time is extended with the consent of the application. 
D.  Prohibition of Pregrading. No site development permit shall be issued for an intended building site unless: 
1.  Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building permit issued by the town; provided, however, that the site development permit may be issued for those projects not requiring a building permit; 
2.  The proposed grading is coordinated with any overall grading plan previously approved by the town for the area in which the site is situated. 
E.  When an application pertains to a significant tree(s), the planning coordinator shall refer the application to a member of the conservation committee designated by the chairperson of the committee and may in addition refer the application to town staff. If the application pertains solely to a significant tree(s), the planning coordinator may issue the permit with appropriate conditions upon receipt of requested reports. If the application pertains to more than a significant tree(s), the planning coordinator shall submit recommendations to the approving authority for the permit.

All grading inspections shall be made pursuant to the inspection requirements of Chapter 70 of the Uniform Building Code as currently adopted by the town, except that the town engineer and, where appropriate, the town geologist shall be responsible for inspection of grading operations requiring a site development permit. The town engineer or town geologist shall, when requested by the town clerk, other designated town staff members, or applicant, make the inspections required in this section and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein such work fails to comply with this chapter. Where it is found by inspection that conditions are not substantially as stated or shown in the application for a site development permit, the town engineer or his designated representative may stop further work until approval is obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to the existing conditions. 
A.  Inspection by Town Engineer. Plans for grading work, bearing the stamp of approval of the town engineer, shall be maintained at the site during the progress of the grading. Until the final inspection is made, a letter issued by the town indicating permission to grade has been granted by the town and an approved set of plans shall be maintained on the premises. In order to obtain inspections in accordance with the following schedule, the permittee shall notify the town engineer and, when appropriate due to conditions of the site development permit, the town geologist at least two full working days before the inspection is to be made: 
1.  Initial inspection: Before commencement of grading operations, and after required construction stakes have been set; 
2.  Rough grading: When all rough grading has been completed; 
3.  Final inspection and approval: When all work, including installation of all drainage and other structures and required planting, has been completed. Final approval shall not be given until all work including installation of all drainage facilities and their protective devices and all erosion-control measures and required planting have been completed in accordance with the final approved grading plan and the final report required under subsection B of this section. 
B.  Final Reports. Upon completion of the rough grading work and at the final completion of the work the town engineer or town geologist may require the following reports and drawings and supplements thereto: 
1.  An as-graded grading plan prepared by the civil engineer including original ground surface elevations, as-graded ground surface elevations, lot drainage patterns and locations and elevations of all surface and subsurface drainage facilities. He shall provide approval that the work was done in accordance with the final approved grading plan. 
2.  A soil grading report prepared by the soil engineer including locations and elevations of field density test, summaries of field and laboratory tests and other substantiating data and comments on any changes made during grading and their effect on the recommendations made in the soil engineering investigation report. He shall provide approval as to the adequacy of the site for the intended use. 
3.  A geologic grading report prepared by the engineering geologist giving a final description of the geology of the site including any new information disclosed during the grading and the effect of same on recommendations incorporated in the approved grading plan. This report shall specifically list all inspections made by the engineering geologist during grading operations and the findings from such inspections. Further, the engineering geologist shall provide approval as to the adequacy of the site for the intended use as affected by geologic factors. 
C.  Inspection by Building Inspector. All structures required by this chapter and requiring building permits shall be inspected by the building inspector in accordance with procedure established by the Uniform Building Code; provided, however, that no building permit for such structures shall be issued until the town engineer has approved a site development permit for the building site and directed that the permit can be issued or has determined that a site development permit is not required by this chapter. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7307), 1984)  
Article IV. - Standards and Specific Requirements 
 
15.12.150 - Grading standards—Compliance required. 
All grading and grading operations shall comply with the requirements set forth in Sections 15.12.160 through 15.12.310 in addition to other requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7400), 1984)  
15.12.160 - Hours of operation. 
All grading operations shall be carried on only between the hours of eight a.m. and five-thirty p.m. Monday through Friday, unless the town engineer finds evidence that an emergency exists which would imperil the public safety, in which case he may permit the work to proceed during such other hours as may be necessary for the duration of the emergency. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7401), 1984)  
15.12.170 - Dust and dirt control. 
All graded surfaces of any nature shall be wetted or suitably contained to prevent nuisance from dust or spillage on town streets or adjacent properties. Equipment, materials and roadways on the site shall be used in a manner or treated so as to prevent excessive dust conditions. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7402), 1984)  
15.12.180 - Slopes. 
The slope of cut or fill surfaces shall be not steeper than is safe for the intended use. Except as provided below or as otherwise recommended in the approved soil engineering or engineering geology report, cut and fill slopes shall be no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical. The town engineer may require that the slope of a cut or fill be made flatter if he finds the material being cut or the fill unusually subject to erosion, or if other conditions make such flatter slope necessary for stability. The town engineer may permit steeper slopes where the material being cut is unusually stable. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7403), 1984)  
15.12.190 - Fill material. 
A. All fill shall be earth, rock or other inert materials free from organic material and free metal, except that topsoil spread on cut and fill surfaces may incorporate humus for desirable moisture-retention properties. Except as permitted by the town engineer, no rock or similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension greater than twelve inches shall be buried or placed in fills. 
B.  Exception: The town engineer may permit placement of larger rock when the soil engineer properly devises a method of placement, continuously inspects its placement and approves the fill stability. The following conditions shall also apply: 
1.  Prior to issuance of the site development permit, potential rock disposal areas shall be delineated on the grading plan. 
2.  Rock sizes greater than twelve inches in maximum dimension shall be ten feet or more below grade, measured vertically. 
3.  All voids around rocks are to be filled with properly compacted, approved fill material. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7404), 1984)  
15.12.200 - Fill location. 
Fill slopes shall not be constructed on natural slopes steeper than two to one. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7404.01), 1984)  
15.12.210 - Drainage. 
Adequate provision shall be made to prevent any surfacewaters from damaging the cut face of an excavation, or any portion of a fill. All drainageways and structures shall carry surfacewaters without producing erosion to the nearest practical street storm drain or natural watercourse approved by the town engineer as a safe place to deposit and receive such waters. The town engineer may require such drainage structures to be constructed, or installed, as are necessary to prevent erosion, or to prevent saturation of the fill or material behind cut slopes, or damage to septic tank drainfields adjacent to the grading project. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7405), 1984)  
15.12.220 - Finished cuts and slopes. 
The exposed or finished cuts or slopes of any fill or excavation shall be smoothly graded and, except when permitted by the town engineer, no such fill, slope, cut or inclined graded surface shall exceed a vertical height of thirty feet. If finished cuts or slopes in excess of thirty feet are permitted, intercepting drains or terraces are required. Such drains and terraces shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of Section 7012 of Chapter 70 of the Uniform Building Code to the satisfaction of the town engineer. All surfacewaters accumulated by such drains and terraces shall be conducted to an approved point of discharge. Any such terrace or intercepting drain shall be designed to prevent overflow which may cause erosion. All exposed slopes of any cut or fill subject to erosion shall be protected by approved planting, crib walls or walls and planting, terracing, or a combination thereof. Graded surfaces exceeding an area of five thousand square feet shall be treated as provided in Section 15.12.260. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7406), 1984)  
15.12.230 - Backfilling. 
Any pipe trench or other trenching or excavation made in any slope of an excavated or filled site shall be backfilled to the level of the surrounding grade. Such backfill shall be compacted to the original density of the excavated materials, but in no case less than ninety percent of the maximum density achieved by AASHO Soil Compaction Test Method T99-57 or T180-57 or as selected by the town engineer. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7407), 1984)  
15.12.240 - Compaction of fills. 
All fills intended to support buildings or structures, or where otherwise required to be compacted for stability of material, shall be compacted, inspected and tested in accordance with the following provisions: 
A.  The ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill by removing vegetation, noncomplying fill, topsoil and other unsuitable materials, scarifying to provide a bond with the new fill, and where slopes are steeper than five to one and height is greater than five feet, by benching into sound bedrock or other competent material as determined by the soil engineer or engineering geologist to the satisfaction of the town engineer and town geologist. The bench under the toe of a fill on a slope steeper than five to one shall be at least ten feet wide. The area beyond the toe of fill shall be sloped for sheet overflow or a paved drain shall be provided. Where fill is to be placed over a cut, the bench under the toe of fill shall be at least ten feet wide, but the cut must be made before placing fill and approved by the applicant's soil engineer and engineering geologist as a suitable foundation for fills. Unsuitable soil is soil which, in the opinion of the town engineer or town geologist, is not competent to support other soil or fill, or to support structures or to satisfactorily perform the other functions for which the soil is intended. 
B.  Unless otherwise directed by the town engineer, the fill shall be spread in a series of layers, each not exceeding six inches in thickness, and shall be compacted by sheepsfoot roller or other approved method after each layer is spread. 
C.  The moisture content of the fill material shall be controlled at the time of spreading and compaction to obtain required maximum density. 
D.  The fill material after compaction shall have a minimum relative density of not less than ninety percent of maximum density in all portions of the fill requiring compaction, in accordance with the Uniform Building Code or an equivalent standard approved by the town engineer. 
E.  A written report of the compaction, showing location and depth of test holes, materials used, moisture conditions, recommended soil bearing pressures, and relative density obtained from all tests, prepared by a civil engineer or soil engineer licensed by the state, shall be submitted to the town engineer. 
F.  The town engineer may require additional tests or information if, in his opinion, the conditions or materials are such that additional information is necessary, and may modify or delete any of the requirements listed in this section that, in his opinion, are unnecessary to further the purpose of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7408), 1984)  
15.12.250 - Setbacks. 
The setbacks and other restrictions specified by this section are minimum and may be increased by the approving authority if necessary for safety and stability or to prevent damage of adjoining properties from deposition or erosion or to provide access for slope maintenance and drainage. Retaining walls may be used to reduce the required setbacks when required by the approving authority. Where trail easements exist, they are not available for cut and fill slopes. 
A.  Setbacks from Property Lines. The tops of cuts and toes of fills shall be set back from the outer boundaries of the permit area, including slope right areas and easements in accordance with figure 1 (a). 
B.  Design Standards for Setbacks. Setbacks between graded slopes (cut or fill) and structures shall be provided in accordance with figure 1 (b). 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7408.01), 1984) 
  
15.12.260 - Erosion control and landscaping. 
All cut and fill surfaces created by grading and subject to erosion (except plowing or discing for agricultural or firebreak purposes) shall be planted with a ground cover that is compatible with the natural ground covers in the town and that will thrive with little or no maintenance once established. Topsoils are to be stockpiled during rough grading and used on cut and fill slopes. On slopes likely to be extensively disturbed by later construction, an interim ground cover may be planted to be supplemented by the permanent ground cover or shrubs and trees when the site is finally developed and landscaped. When slopes too steep to support continuous ground cover are permitted, screening shall be accomplished by placing vines and plantings in niches and ledges set in the slopes. Cuts and fills along public roads, roadside trails or paths, or trail easements may be required to be landscaped so as to blend into the natural surroundings. All plant materials and their placement shall be satisfactory to the conservation committee. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7409), 1984)  
15.12.270 - Tilling for agriculture or fire protection. 
Tilling of the ground for agricultural or fire protection purposes shall be by such practices as contour plowing which will prevent erosion and prevent damage to natural drainage channels. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7410), 1984)  
15.12.275 - Protection of significant trees. 
The following provisions shall be adhered to: 
A.  The following protections are the minimum required and the approving authority may require additional protection measures: 
1.  A fence shall be built around the dripline of the tree(s) prior to any work, and no construction activities shall be carried on within the dripline. Construction activities shall include but not be limited to storage of materials, dumping of waste materials and parking of vehicles, 
2.  Permits for construction within a dripline of any significant trees shall include: provisions for hand trenching within the dripline; construction of approved tree wells to protect against fill; prohibition of cuts or fills within four feet of a tree base; and review of any cutting or trimming, 
3.  Damage to significant trees shall be cared for by a licensed tree specialist familiar with local native trees and town regulations regarding same, with notice to the planning coordinator, 
4.  Posting of a bond or deposit to insure protection of significant trees during construction; 
B.  Use of measures to effect erosion control, soil and water retention and limitation of adverse environmental effects relating to shade, noise buffers, protection from wind, air pollution and historic features; 
C.  Replacement of trees removed with other trees on the native plant list, as near as possible to the original location, unless practical reasons preclude this option. 
(Ord. 1993-274 § 1 (part), 1993)  
15.12.280 - Site development certificate. 
If, upon final inspection of any grading (as specified in Section 15.12.140(A)(3), it is found that the work authorized by the site development permit has been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, and any other requirements imposed, a site development certificate covering such work, and stating that the work is approved, shall be issued to the permittee by the town engineer. 
A.  The town engineer shall have the power to revoke any site development certificate whenever he finds that the work covered by the certificate has been materially extended or altered, without a permit, or that any planting, retaining walls, cribbing, drainage structures, or other protective devices as shown on the approved plans and specifications submitted with the application for a permit have not been maintained in good order and repair. 
B.  Before such revocation, the town engineer shall first give written notice to the owner of the property involved, specifying the defective condition and stating that unless such defective condition is remedied satisfactorily, the site development certificate may be revoked. If the defective condition is remedied to the satisfaction of the town engineer, the certificate shall not be revoked. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7411), 1984)  
15.12.290 - Special precautions. 
A. If, at any stage of the grading, the town engineer determines by inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure, the town engineer may require, as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable special precautions be taken as he considers advisable to avoid likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but are not limited to, specifying a flatter exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and reports of a registered soil engineer or registered engineering geologist whose recommendations may be made requirements for further work. 
B.  Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail, the town engineer may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion or may require that the operation be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains. 
C.  Special precautions shall be taken when construction must occur in areas of public trails as follows: 
1.  No soil or construction materials should be stockpiled or toolsheds located on the trail or within the trail easement. If such interference cannot be avoided, a temporary and safe trail bypass shall be provided to the satisfaction of the trails committee chairman or his designated representative. 
2.  Any unavoidable trail disturbance shall only be for a minimum period of time, and after work is complete the trail shall be restored to its original condition. Plans shall clearly identify trail disturbance proposed, and a bond shall be posted for reestablishment of the trail after construction. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7412), 1984)  
15.12.300 - Driveway design—Entrances. 
A. Driveways shall enter the fronting road or street as nearly at right angles (or a radial line, if on a curve) as physical features permit. Returns connecting the sides of a drive and road shall have a radius of ten feet. 
B.  Driveways shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that stormwater runoff originating on a roadway will not be concentrated to drain down the drive, and stormwater runoff originating on the private property will be properly conveyed to an established ditch or gutter and not concentrated onto a roadway surface. In addition, any concentration of stormwaters shall be conveyed away from septic tank system drainfields. 
C.  Where the driveway is in an embankment, culverts and embankment protectors shall be used to convey the runoff or other drainage to proper disposal channels. 
D.  Adequate and safe sight distance shall be provided for a design speed of fifteen miles per hour. 
E.  Standing space for motor vehicles, immediately adjacent to the driveway, shall be provided pursuant to applicable sections of Title 18 of this code.

G.  An encroachment permit shall be required for work to be done in the public right-of-way. 
H.  Horizontal alignment of the driveway shall be adequate for safe and convenient travel. 
I.  Driveways shall have a minimum grade of 0.5 percent and a maximum grade of fifteen percent unless in the opinion of the approving authority a steeper grade will result in a development more in keeping with the purposes of this chapter, in which case grades up to twenty percent may be permitted. All grade changes shall be connected with vertical curves long enough to prevent contact of car or fire truck undercarriage or bumper, and to give adequate riding comfort, and shall meet the standards of the town engineer. 
J.  Double-access, or "loop," driveways with two entrances to a road or street shall not be permitted unless determined necessary for reasons of safety by the traffic committee. 
K.  A common driveway may serve up to two building sites as long as it does not result in a conflict with the zoning and subdivision provisions of the town and is improved in conformance with the standards of this chapter. A single private access serving more than two building sites will be permitted only when improved as a private road pursuant to road standards of Title 17 of this code, and only when it will not result in a conflict with the zoning and subdivision provisions of the town or other requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1984-201 § 1 (7413), 1984)  
15.12.310 - Driveway width and surfacing. 
A. Driveways entering a road or street shall have a minimum paved width, asphalt, concrete or rocked, of twelve feet and a maximum paved width, asphalt, concrete or rocked, of twenty feet. The first twenty feet of driveway measured from the edge of pavement of the existing street or road shall be paved with asphalt or concrete, or treated with an oil penetration coat to the satisfaction of the town engineer. In addition, all driveways shall have a minimum vertical clearance of ten feet. 
B.  Driveways serving a single building site with a length measured from roadway to garage of less than one hundred fifty feet shall have a minimum paved width, asphalt or rocked, of twelve feet. 
C.  Driveways serving two building sites, or having a length of one hundred fifty feet or greater, shall have a minimum paved width, asphalt, concrete or rocked, of twelve feet and in addition, turnouts shall be provided at intervals not exceeding three hundred fifty feet or at such shorter distances as may be required because of limited sight distance due to the curvature of alignment. The total width at such turnouts shall be not less than eighteen feet. In addition to such turnouts, a turnaround or backaround shall be provided for fire apparatus at standards set by the fire marshal. 
D.  Crown or cross slope of driveway shall be from one percent to three percent. 
E.  Driveways shall have a minimum compacted thickness of untreated rock base of six inches. Compaction shall be ninety-five percent for a minimum depth of 0.5 feet below finish grade as determined by California Test Method No. 216 or approved equal. 
F.  Where centerline grade of any section of driveway exceeds eight percent and drains toward the street or road serving the parcel, the driveway shall be surfaced with an asphalt concrete surface one and one-half inches thick, or be constructed of some combination of base and surface providing equal strength and durability. For grades over twelve percent to the maximum grade of twenty percent, asphalt concrete or portland cement concrete will be required unless waived by the town engineer. 
G.  Berms and drainage facilities shall be provided where required by the town engineer. 
H.  All culverts, bridges and other related structures shall be designed for an equivalent wheel load of six thousand pounds and H-20 loading criteria as adopted by the state of California, Department of Public Works, Division of Highways, to facilitate safe movement of emergency vehicles and firefighting equipment. 
I.  All rock driveways serving more than a single building site shall be treated with an oil penetration coat to the satisfaction of the town engineer. 
J.  In zoning districts requiring a parcel area of one acre or more, the width of driveways in the front setback and in the public right-of-way shall not exceed twelve feet unless a greater width is required for fire protection purposes, the setback is so small as to constrain access to a garage, or it has been demonstrated to the ASCC that for safety reasons a wider driveway is necessary.

The applicant shall be required to file with the town clerk a faithful performance bond or other improvement security satisfactory to the town attorney in the amount deemed sufficient by the town engineer to ensure the completion of all improvements, landscaping, maintenance of landscaping for such periods as specified by the town, engineering, inspection fees and incidental expenses. The town engineer may waive the bond requirement if he finds that the proposed work is such that it does not have potential to interfere with any natural or otherwise established drainage, endanger persons or public or private property, constitute a nuisance, or in any way be inconsistent or potentially inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
B.  Conditions of Bond. Among other appropriate provisions, every bond shall include the following conditions to which the principal and surety shall each be bound: 
1.  To comply with all of the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations; 
2.  To comply with all of the terms and conditions of the site development permit to the satisfaction of the town engineer; 
3.  To complete all of the work contemplated under the site development permit within the time limit specified in the permit. (The town engineer may, for sufficient cause, extend the time specified in the permit, but no such extension shall release the surety upon the bond.); 
4.  To pay all reasonable costs incurred or expended by the town, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney's fees, in doing or causing to be done any of the work set forth in the site development permit, any other work which in the judgment of the town engineer is required to be done as a result of any work or activity done under the permit, or any abatement of any nuisance created by any work or activity done under the permit, or in collecting money or damages in connection with any of the foregoing. 
C.  Term of Bond. The term of the bond shall begin on the date of its posting and shall end on the satisfactory completion of the terms and conditions of the site development permit. Evidence of completion shall be when the final inspection and approval, and final reports have been completed pursuant to Section 15.12.140 and documents verifying completion filed with the records of the permit. 
D.  Notice of Default. Whenever the town engineer finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any term or condition of a site development permit, he shall give written notice thereof separately to the permit holder and to his surety. Such notice shall state the work or other things necessary to be done in order to cure the default, its estimated cost, if known, and the period of time deemed reasonably necessary by the town engineer to complete the work, and to do such other things which are necessary to be done in order to cure the default. The time period to cure the default normally shall be from thirty to sixty days, unless the town engineer determines a shorter, or longer, period is appropriate given the unique circumstances of the particular project. The notice of default shall be served personally or by deposit in the United States mail in a sealed envelope, with postage fully prepaid, addressed to the permit holder and to his surety at the mailing address, or, if there is no mailing address, the business address, shown in the application or in the bond. 
E.  Duty of Surety. Upon service of the notice of default the surety shall be obligated to have the work and other things done within the time specified in the notice. 
F.  Disposition of Cash Security. If cash money or its equivalent or an instrument of credit has been deposited to secure the bond, and if notice of default has been served upon the permit holder and he has failed to do the work and other things required to be done by the notice within the time specified in the notice, the town may use such deposit in order to have such work and other things done, by contract or other means at the discretion of the town. The balance, if any, shall be returned to the depositor after completion of the work and other things. 
G.  Right of Entry. In the event of any default in the performance of any term or condition of the site development permit the surety, if any, or any person employed or engaged on its behalf, or the town engineer or any other person employed or engaged on behalf of the town, shall have the right to go upon the premises to complete the work and do the other things required by the permit. It is unlawful for any person in any way to hinder, obstruct, or prevent such entry. In furtherance of this provision, every application for site development permit shall be signed by the property owner and/or such other person legally empowered to act on behalf of the property owner. Signing of the site development permit application shall grant the license for the purposes of entry and completion of work specified in this chapter. Furthermore, site development permits, once approved, shall not be assignable without prior approval of the applicable town approving authority.

(Ord. 1999-317 § 2 (part), 1999)  
15.26.040 - Demolition criteria. 
A. Determination. Within ten days of the emergency, any building or structure determined by the building official either to pose an off-site threat or hazard to public health and safety, or to the public right-of-way, may be condemned and immediately demolished. 
B.  Public Nuisance. All buildings or structures or portions thereof which, after inspection by an authorized town official, are determined to pose a threat to the health or safety of the public, its occupants, or any adjacent building or structure will be declared a public nuisance and shall be abated by the owner or town in accordance with the procedure specified in this chapter. 
C.  Notice and Order. Except as provided below, the building official shall post a placard on the condemned building or structure and notify the property owner by hand-delivery, telephone, facsimile or other reasonable means that the building or structure poses an off-site threat or hazard to public health and safety and, as such, constitutes a public nuisance and must be abated. The town shall also attempt to notify any other party of record with an equitable or legal interest in the property. The notice shall set forth those factors which, in the opinion of the building official, make the building or structure an imminent hazard and danger to off-site property. The notice shall provide that within forty-eight hours from the time of issuance of the notice, the owner or other party of record shall submit an acceptable abatement plan, as defined below, to the building official. Reasonable efforts shall be undertaken by the property owner to allow tenants to remove their contents from the building before any demolition occurs. 
D.  Immediate Abatement. No prior notice shall be required, if after considering all the facts, the building official determines in writing that the building or structure poses an off-site threat or hazard to public health and safety and as such, must be immediately abated because time and circumstances do not permit prior notice to be given to the owner. Under such circumstances, the Building Official may cause the public nuisance to be immediately abated. If the owner of any building or structure has decided to demolish rather than repair, the owner, or the owner's representative, shall obtain a demolition permit. 
E.  Abatement Plan. In those cases where the town provides notice and receives a timely abatement plan, the building official shall review the plan promptly to determine whether the plan is acceptable. To be acceptable, the plan must be reasonably calculated to cause immediate abatement of the public nuisance. If the abatement plan is approved, the owner, his or her designee, or any other interested party of record shall abate the public nuisance in accordance with the order of the building official within twenty-four hours of obtaining approval of the plan. Thereafter, within twenty-four (24) hours of completion of the abatement work, the owner or other interested party of record shall provide the building official with a written certification from the owner's architect, structural or civil engineer which certifies that "the public nuisance," as described in the building official's abatement notice, has been abated. 
If the work performed pursuant to the abatement plan amounts to a temporary abatement, the owner or other party of record, prior to proceeding with permanent repairs, shall obtain required permits and file a damage assessment report with the building official. The damage assessment report shall be reviewed and approved by the building official before permanent repairs are performed. 
In those instances where the property owner or other intersted party either does not respond to the building official's notice of abatement, untimely responds, or timely responds but fails to abate the public nuisance within the required time period, the building or structure posing an off-site threat to the public health or safety shall be subject to abatement by the building official. 
F.  Suspension of Abatement Work. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the building official is authorized to suspend abatement work by the town, or the town's contractor, and allow the property owner or other interested parties to complete the abatement work. 
G.  Change of Status. When the conditions making a building or structure an off-site threat to the public health or safety have been abated pursuant to this chapter, the building or structure shall no longer be considered a threat to the public health or safety. However, if the abatement work is temporary in nature, as determined by the building official, the building or structure shall remain subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1999-317 § 2 (part), 1999)  
15.26.050 - Appeals. 
A. Appeal. The property owner or other interested party may make an appeal to the town council regarding the building official's decision which determined that the building or structure posed an off-site threat or hazard to public health and safety. Any such appeal shall indicate the basis of error by the building official, and shall be hand-delivered to the town clerk or the building official within forty-eight hours of the time of issuance of notice, pursuant to this section. No appeal shall be considered filed, or effective, unless the appellant also files a timely abatement plan with the building official. To be considered timely, the abatement plan must be filed within the time required by this section. Failure to appeal within the required forty-eight hours appeal period shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal to the town council, and the building official's determination and order shall stand. 
B.  Form of Appeal. All appeals of the building official's notice and order to abate shall: 
1.  Indicate the basis of error by the building official; and 
2.  Contain the home telephone numbers, home address, business telephone number and business address of the appellant. 
C.  Hearing. Upon receipt of a valid appeal, the building official shall schedule an appeal hearing before the town council as soon as possible. The appellant shall be notified of the date, time and place of the hearing as soon as possible. Whenever practicable, the hearing shall be held within forty-eight hours of the time the appeal is filed. 
At the hearing, the appellant shall have the right to call witnesses, submit evidence and to cross-examine the witnesses of the town. All witnesses shall be sworn. A record of the entire proceedings shall be made by tape recording. Any relevant evidence may be admitted regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule, which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions in the courts of this state. 
At the close of the hearing, the town council shall act to uphold, overrule or modify the determination and order of the building official. The determination and order of the building official shall be upheld, unless the town council finds, based upon the evidence in the record, that the building official erred in determining that the building or structure poses an off-site threat or hazard to the public health and safety. The decision of the town council with the reasons therefor, may be given orally on the record. If given orally, the decision shall be memorialized in writing and served upon the appellant within twenty-four hours of the time the oral decision is rendered. 
If the town council upholds the decision of the building official, the property owner or other interested party of record shall be ordered to abate the public nuisance within the time set forth in the order. If the building or structure is determined not to pose an off-site threat or hazard to the public health and safety, the building official's determination and order shall be vacated. The decision of the town council shall be final on the date it is rendered.

LA= Landscape area including SLA (square feet) 
0.45= Additional water allowance for SLA in residential areas 
0.55= Additional water allowance for SLA in non-residential areas 
SLA= Special landscape area (square feet) 
G.  A local agency or project applicant may consider effective precipitation (twenty-five percent of annual precipitation) in tracking water use and may use the following equation to calculate the MAWA: 
1.  MAWA = (ETo - Eppt) (0.62) [(0.55 x LA) + (0.45 x SLA)] for residential areas. 
2.  MAWA = (ETo - EPPT) (0.62) [(0.45 x LA) + (0.55 x SLA)] for non-residential areas. 
H.  Estimated total water use (ETWU) will be calculated using the equation below. The sum of the ETWU calculated for all hydrozones will not exceed the MAWA. 
ETWU = (ETo) (0.62) ( 	PF x HA 
IE 	+ SLA ) 
 
Where: 
ETWU= Estimated total water use per year (gallons) 
ETo= Reference evapotranspiration (inches) 
PF= Plant factor from WUCOLS (see Section 15.32.020) 
HA= Hydrozone area [high, medium, and low water use areas] (square feet) 
0.75= Irrigation efficiency (IE) for overhead spray devices 
0.81= Irrigation efficiency (IE) for drip system devices 
SLA= Special landscape area (square feet)

G.  To protect the community against excessive storm water runoff, soil erosion, earth movement, earthquake, and other geologic hazards; 
H.  To make possible ease of law enforcement and fire protection through orderly design and development and the provision of adequate facilities and improvements; 
I.  To insure at the time of subdivision that water supply, storm drainage, sewage disposal, and other utilities, services and improvements needed as a consequence of the division of land are adequately provided for and that such utilities, services and improvements first serve adjoining areas and then be incrementally extended to serve contiguous new development rather than be extended so as to allow development to "leapfrog" over intervening lands; 
J.  To insure that governmental costs are minimized by requiring the installation of improvements of adequate size and quality and maintenance districts where appropriate; 
K.  To provide streets of adequate capacity with appropriate improvements to provide access to abutting property and to carry the anticipated traffic, and to insure that streets are designed so as to minimize safety hazards to vehicles and their occupants, pedestrians and equestrians; 
L.  To assure that street rights-of-way are corridors of natural vegetation and terrain through which motorists and others can travel and retain the feeling of passing through a natural, undisturbed area, and that street rights-of-way are designed to form an important part of the total open space environment of the town; 
M.  To provide pedestrian paths, bicycle paths, and riding and hiking trials for the safety and convenience of pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians desiring access to community facilities, for travel throughout the community, and for enjoyment of the natural amenities of the community; 
N.  To minimize through traffic on residential streets; 
O.  To make possible the coordination of subdivision development with the provision of public facilities, such as parks, recreation areas, schools and other types of community facilities; 
P.  To assist in implementing the general plan of the town, especially the features of the residential open space preserve and the conservation of wooded areas as defined in the general plan; 
Q.  To insure that at the time of subdivision improvement, adequate planting is provided to control erosion and reduce the overall impact of subdivision improvements and subsequent development on the ecologic and visual qualities of the community.

The general plan shall be used as a guide to determine the character of land division including lot size and arrangement and the type and extent of streets, roads, highways and other utilities and public facilities that shall be provided by the subdivider. In subdivision design, particular attention shall be given to the general plan policy which calls for the grouping or clustering of residential buildings where this will maximize the opportunity to preserve natural beauty and open space without generally increasing the intensity of development otherwise possible. 
B.  Consideration shall be given, within the established framework of local streets, to provision for uniformity of street widths where appropriate and for properly relating alignments and street names. Preservation of the privacy and safety of streets in residential areas shall be encouraged by the prevention of through traffic in such areas. The amount of street required shall be related to the vehicular and pedestrian traffic generating characteristics of anticipated uses of abutting land. Traffic capacity shall be provided to meet recreational travel needs where appropriate. The number of intersections or thoroughfares shall be reduced to a minimum consistent with the basic needs of ingress and egress. Intersections shall be so designed as to provide for optimum safety for pedestrians and motorists and other users of streets, highways and walks. Provision shall be made for assuring adequate light, air and privacy on all parcels of property, regardless of the land use. Topography and vegetation shall be respected and streets shall be designed so as to prevent excessive grading and scarring of the landscape. Special care shall be taken in design and construction to provide stable soil and subsoil conditions.

The dedication of easements shall not be construed as complying with the requirements of this section. 
1.  For subdivisions containing fifty lots or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee determined by multiplying .005 times the land value per acre times the projected number of new residents of the subdivision. The average size of household used to estimate the projected number of residents shall be taken from the most recent federal census or a census taken pursuant to Chapter 17, commencing with Section 40200, of Part 2, Division 3, Title 4 of the Government Code of California. The fee shall be based on the market value of the land in the subdivision at the time of approval of the final subdivision map as determined by an appraiser retained by the town and paid from a deposit made by the subdivider. The subdivider may, if he desires, and with the concurrence of the planning commission, dedicate five percent of the total land area rather than pay the fee. However, the planning commission must find that such land conforms with provisions of paragraph A(3) of this section. 
2.  For subdivisions of more than fifty lots, the subdivider shall dedicate an amount of land determined by multiplying .005 acres times the projected number of residents of the subdivision or pay a fee, or both, in such ratio as the planning commission deems most desirable. The bases for projecting the number of residents of the subdivision and determining the market value of land shall be as stipulated in paragraph A(1) of this section. 
3.  All land to be dedicated for park or recreational purposes must be found to be suitable by the planning commission as to location, parcel size and topography for the park and recreation purposes considered desirable by the planning commission, and such may include land for any of the following, or other park and recreational purposes, as approved by the planning commission and provided for in the general plan: 
a.  Neighborhood preserves and neighborhood parks; 
b.  Community preserves and community parks; 
c.  Parkways and greenways; 
d.  Areas of particular natural beauty, including open space preserves, wooded conservation areas, residential open space preserves to be developed or left in their original state. 
4.  Land to be dedicated may include all of a proposed park and/or recreational facility, or may include only part of a facility. Such partial dedication may be added to by public land purchase or by dedication of additional land on adjoining property whether or not owned by the subdivider. 
B.  At the time of approval of the final subdivision map, the town shall specify when development of the park or recreational facility shall begin.

Fifteen percent of the lot in a subdivision shall be developed for affordable housing, as defined in Section 18.04.055 of this code. The subdivider shall transfer these lots to the town and the town will seek an appropriate subdivider to construct the affordable housing. Alternatively, the subdivider, at the town council's discretion, may retain said lots and develop them for affordable housing subject to all provisions of this section. The subdivider shall provide to the inclusionary lots all subdivision improvements required by this section, and these lots shall be developed as a part of a PUD pursuant to Chapter 18.44 of this code. Deed restrictions approved by the town shall be placed on all inclusionary lots and/or units developed on these lots to ensure continued affordability of the lots and/or units. In calculating the number of inclusionary lots to be provided, a fraction of a lot shall be rounded up to a whole lot; provided that the subdivider may, at the subdivider's option, provide to the town an in-lieu fee for any fractional lot. The amount of such in-lieu fees shall be set out in guidelines established by the town. The in-lieu fees shall be placed in a special housing fund for use solely for affordable housing. The town may waive an in-lieu fee if the subdivider agrees to build a number of affordable housing units acceptable to the town. Any subdivider subject to this section shall receive a density bonus of ten percent notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 18.50. The procedures for calculating the density bonus shall be set out in guidelines established by the town.

CHAPTER 17.32 - LOTS 
Sections: 
 
17.32.010 - Suitability of lots for purpose. 
All subdivision shall result in the creation of lots which are capable of being developed or built upon while conforming with setback requirements of the zoning title and retaining the basic natural qualities of the site. No subdivision shall create lots which are impractical for improvement or use due to steepness of terrain, location of water courses, periodic flooding, earth movement, size, shape or other physical conditions. Subdivisions shall create lots that provide for grouping or clustering of residential buildings where this will maximize the opportunity to preserve natural beauty and open space. 
(Ord. 1979-168 § 5 (part), 1979: Ord. 1967-71 § 1 (7650.01), 1967)  
17.32.020 - Lot size. 
The minimum area and dimensions of all lots shall conform to the general plan, the requirements of the zoning ordinance for the districts in which the subdivision is located, or such modifications of the lot area and dimensions as may have been approved as part of a planned unit development, and purposes of this title. Where difficult terrain or other unusual conditions exist, lots larger than these minimum areas shall be required as necessary in order to accomplish the purposes set forth in this title. 
(Ord. 1967-71 § 1 (7650.02), 1967)  
17.32.030 - Lot lines. 
Lot lines shall be placed to create usable building sites, permit accommodation of sites to the natural terrain and vegetation, and to afford access to the building site without requiring excessive grading. To the extent possible, lot lines shall be placed so as to be compatible with contours and avoid lot lines at or near right angles to contours. 
(Ord. 1979-168 § 5 (part), 1979: Ord. 1967-71 § 1 (7650.03), 1967)  
17.32.040 - Resubdivision. 
In cases in which lots may be resubdivided at some future time, the location of lot lines and other details of layout shall be such that resubdivision may readily take place without violating the requirements of this title and without interfering with the orderly extension of roads and streets. 
(Ord. 1967-71 § 1 (7650.04), 1967)  
17.32.050 - Lot depth. 
The average depth of any lot shall not exceed three times its average width except where a modification is approved as part of a planned unit development under the zoning title. The average depth of panhandle lots, where permitted in accordance with Section 17.32.100, shall be measured from the front and rear property lines enclosing the portion of such lots excluding the panhandle. 
(Ord. 1967-71 § 1 (7650.05), 1967)  
17.32.060 - Access to streets. 
Except where modification is approved as part of a planned unit development under the zoning ordinance, the following shall apply: 
A.  All lots created shall have not less than forty feet of frontage on a dedicated street meeting the minimum requirements of this title for pavement and right-of-way widths, and improved in accordance with the standards for public improvements set forth in this title. The planning commission may permit a smaller frontage dimension for panhandle lots when such lots are found acceptable pursuant to provisions of Section 17.32.100. 
B.  Lots, other than corner lots, normally shall not have access to more than one street. 
C.  On any lot intended for residential occupancy it shall be possible to provide safe vehicular access via a private driveway, conforming to the standards of the site development ordinance, from the street on which the lot faces to a garage, carport or parking site on the lot in a location conforming with the requirements of the zoning title. The alignment of the driveway shall not traverse slopes in excess of thirty percent except that in the first twenty feet from the street right-of-way, the slope can exceed thirty percent. No cut or fill shall exceed six feet in depth or height. The planning commission may allow these limits to be exceeded where design solutions are proposed which mitigate environmental and engineering problems. Where required by the town, detailed topography shall be submitted to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section. 
D.  Where two parcels are adjoining, a common driveway meeting the standards of the site development ordinance will be acceptable provided a joint maintenance agreement is recorded against each of the parcels.

(Ord. 1967-71 § 1 (7650.09), 1967)  
17.32.100 - Panhandle lots. 
Panhandle lots are those lots which include a strip of land used primarily for gaining access from a street to the major portion of the lot, and shall be permitted by the planning commission only when they result in a division of land more fully complying with the purposes of this title as set forth in Section 17.04.040 than could otherwise have been achieved. Panhandle lots need not meet the minimum footage requirements of Section 17.32.060. However, the panhandle portion shall be wide enough to accommodate the access driveway, utilities, trails and paths, or other similar facilities required by this title with minimum grading and in no case shall be less than twenty-five feet wide.

17.40.020 - Collector and thoroughfare roads. 
Where appropriate to the design, proposed collector and thoroughfare roads and streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. The centerlines of the streets not in alignment shall be offset at least one hundred feet. 
(Ord. 1979-168 § 5 (part), 1979: Ord. 1967-71 § 1 (7650.41 (A)), 1967)  
17.40.030 - Extension of streets to boundary lines of subdivision. 
Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the land to be divided in all cases where in the opinion of the planning commission such extension is necessary for traffic circulation and coordination of the layout of the proposed subdivision with existing development, or the advantageous future development of adjacent property. 
(Ord. 1979-168 § 5 (part), 1979: Ord. 1967-71 § 1 (7650.41 (B)), 1967)  
17.40.040 - Cul-de-sacs. 
Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed one thousand feet in length; provided, however, that where turnouts or turnarounds are provided to the satisfaction of the fire chief and in his opinion adequate fire protection is possible, cul-de-sacs may be increased to two thousand feet in length. They shall terminate in a circle with a diameter of not less than eighty feet at the property line and diameter of not less than sixty-eight feet at the inside face of the curb, or other turning pattern approved by the planning commission on recommendation by the town engineer.

17.40.050 - Stub-end streets. 
In the case of stub-end streets extending to the boundary of the property, a one-foot strip the width of the right-of-way shall be deeded to the town at the end of the stub-end street, and improvement of the strip shall be suspended, pending the extension of the street into adjacent property. Where required by the planning commission, a temporary turnaround or a temporary connection to another street shall be provided within a public right-of-way by the subdivider. 
(Ord. 1979-169 § 5 (part), 1979: Ord. 1967-71 § 1 (7650.41 (D)), 1967)

A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any individual with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when the application of a land use, zoning or building regulation, policy, practice or procedure acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. 
(Ord. 2011-390 § 3, 2011)  
18.11.030 - Notice of availability. 
To ensure that individuals with disabilities are aware of the reasonable accommodation procedure, notice of the availability of reasonable accommodation shall be prominently displayed at public information counters in town hall, advising the public of the availability of the procedure for eligible individuals.

F.  The written decision on the request for reasonable accommodation shall explain in detail the basis of the decision, including the reviewing authority's findings on the criteria set forth in subsection B. above. All written decisions shall give notice of the applicant's right to appeal and to request reasonable accommodation in the appeals process as set forth below.

KK.  "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimension of the structure. The term does not, however, include any alteration to comply with the existing state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
LL.  "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
MM.  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
NN.  "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(Ord. 2005-358, § 1, 2005)  
18.32.150 - Floodproofing—New residential structures or substantial improvements—Authorization by variance. 
Floodproofing of new residential structures, or of substantial improvements to existing residential structures for human habitation may be authorized by variance in accordance with the provisions of this section. All variances applications shall be considered by the board of adjustment and shall be made on the variance application form provided by the floodplain administrator. 
A.  Nature of variance. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this floodplain regulations would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. The variance provisions, however, are established with the understanding that protection from flood hazards is the compelling objective, and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or other requirements in the flood ordinance are deemed to be rare. Therefore, the variance provisions in this section are intentionally very detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly authorized. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
B.  Factors to be considered by the board of adjustment. In acting upon requests for variances, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing owner or occupants and future owners or occupants of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the general plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
C.  Conditions for granting of a variance by board of adjustment. The following conditions shall govern granting of variances: 
1.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures and provisions for flood hazard reduction in this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
3.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance or cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with other existing Town regulations. 
5.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 18.32.150 B and the purposes of this chapter, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of, and preserve the integrity of this chapter. 
D.  Notice of action on variance. Any applicant to whom a variance has been granted shall be given written notice by the floodplain administrator that: 1. the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and 2. such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Further, a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the San Mateo County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. The costs for such notice and recording of the notice shall be paid by the applicant to whom the variance has been granted. 
E.  Variance terms defined. In addition to the other definitions contained in Section 18.32.020 of this chapter, the following words and their meanings pertain to the foregoing variance provisions: 
1.  "Fraud and victimization" means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the board of adjustment will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during such periods of time to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased potential for flood damages may bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
2.  "Hardship" means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. To grant a variance, the board of adjustment must determine that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, or personal preferences, likewise cannot, as a rule, quality as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
3.  "Public safety and nuisance" means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons. 
(Ord. 2005-358, § 1, 2005)  
18.32.160. - Development permit review, action on permit, notification of other agencies, certification and maintenance of records, map determinations, remedial actions. 
The floodplain administrator shall review all development permits to determine that required conditions of this chapter have been satisfied, all other required state and federal permits have been obtained, the site is reasonably safe from flooding, and the proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. 
A.  Notification of other agencies. For any alteration or relocation of a watercourse the floodplain administrator shall notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation and shall submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. The notification shall including data assuring that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
B.  Documentation of floodplain development. The floodplain administrator shall obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed all certifications required by this chapter and all development permit application data required by Section 18.32.035. 
C.  Map determinations. The floodplain administrator shall make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. Any person contesting the location of the boundary may appeal the interpretation of the floodplain administrator as provided in Chapter 18.66 of this title. 
D.  Remedial action. The floodplain administrator shall take action to remedy any violations of this chapter.

In addition, the following shall pertain to applications for conditional use permits, minor wireless permits or permit amendments for wireless communication facilities. 
B.  Application Guidelines. The town council authorizes the director of planning and building and the director of public works to establish other reasonable rules and regulations and update or amend permit application requirements, forms, checklists that the directors find necessary or useful for processing any application governed by this chapter. All such guidelines or applications issued under this authority shall be in writing and shall be made publicly available on the city's website. 
C.  Pre-Submittal Conference. Before applying for a CUP or minor wireless permit for a wireless communications facility, the applicant shall schedule and attend a pre-submittal conference with the public works director and/or the planning and building director. The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review process through informal discussion that includes, without limitation, any issues relative to the proposed or existing wireless communication facility, potential concealment issues, coordination with other city departments responsible for application review. The city shall use reasonable efforts to provide the applicant with an appointment within five working days after receiving a written request and any applicable fee or deposit to reimburse the town for its reasonable costs to provide the services rendered in the pre-submittal conference. 
D.  Submittal Appointment. All applications under this chapter must be submitted to the city at a pre-scheduled appointment with the director. Applicants may generally submit one application per appointment but may batch applications for small wireless facilities. The director shall use reasonable efforts to provide the applicant with an appointment within five working days after the director receives a written request and, if applicable, confirms that the applicant complied with the pre-submittal conference requirement. Any application received without an appointment, whether delivered in-person, by mail or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the applicant received a written exemption from the director at a pre-submittal conference. 
E.  Application Duly Filed. An application shall not be deemed duly filed and no time period for reaching a decision regarding the application shall begin to run until the applicant has provided all of the project information and plans required by this title or by forms and checklists established by the planning department and all required application fees and deposits have been paid by the applicant. Further, any required study or report, performed at the request of the town by a radio frequency expert or other expert retained by the town, shall be provided prior to the application being deemed complete and all such studies or reports shall be at the expense of the applicant and funds shall be deposited in advance to cover the cost of any such study or report. 
F.  Permit Life.

CHAPTER 18.43 - FENCES 
Sections: 
 
18.43.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of the fence regulations is to ensure that fences in required yards in residential zoning districts conform to the following principles: 
•  Fences should be designed with consideration for the open space tradition of Portola Valley. 
•  Fences should be used sparingly in order to preserve a sense of the shared scenic resources of the community. 
•  Fences should be designed with respect for the movement of wildlife and the protection of views. 
•  Fence designs and materials should blend with the natural environment and maintain the natural and rural ambiance of the town. 
The above principles shall be followed by residents, town planning staff and the ASCC when designing or developing fences or considering fence permit applications. 
(Ord. 2005-360, § 3, 2005)  
18.43.020 - Location. 
A. In residential zoning districts fences may be erected in the following locations: 
1.  In districts requiring a minimum parcel area of less than one acre, domestic fences or fences consistent with the standards of a horse fence are allowed in required yards, including along property lines. 
2.  In districts requiring a minimum parcel area of one acre, domestic fences or horse fences are allowed in required yards, including along property lines, except that a domestic fence in a front yard must be set back at least twenty-five feet from the front property line. 
3.  In districts requiring a minimum parcel area of two acres or more, only horse fences are allowed in required yards, including along property lines. 
4.  In addition to the above limitations, in districts requiring a minimum parcel area of one acre or more, domestic fences and horse fences in required yards shall be allowed only on slopes of twenty percent or less. 
5.  Along riparian corridors, fences shall be set back a minimum of twenty feet from the top of a creek bank. The top of the creek bank shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by Town Planning staff or the ASCC based on physical inspection of site conditions. 
6.  Double fencing (where two or more fences are placed parallel to one another often for the purpose of deterring deer or other animals) must be located within the building envelope of a parcel. 
(Ord. 2005-360, § 3, 2005)  
18.43.030 - Height. 
A. The height of a fence is the vertical distance measured from the surface of the actual adjoining ground to the top of the fence. For the purpose of applying height regulations, the average height of the fence along any unbroken run may be used, provided the height at any point is not more than ten percent greater than that normally permitted. 
B.  Fences in residential zoning districts are subject to the following height limits: 
1.  Fence heights shall not exceed four feet in front yards, six feet in side and rear yards, and four feet in side yards along road rights-of-way. 
2.  Horse fences shall not exceed four feet in height. 
3.  Fences adjacent to public trails and paths in districts requiring a minimum parcel area of one acre or more shall not exceed four feet in height. 
C.  A fence of normally permitted height under this section shall not be placed on top of fill designed so as to effectively increase the elevation of the top of the fence. 
D.  The height of a retaining wall, or a retaining wall with a fence erected on top of it, is measured from the exposed bottom of the wall to the top of the wall/fence. 
E.  The height of a fence placed on top of a fill supported by a retaining wall is measured from the top of the natural grade directly below the wall to the top of the fence. 
(Ord. 2005-360, § 3, 2005)  
18.43.040 - Opacity. 
A. Fences are subject to the following fence opacity limits: 
1.  In districts requiring a minimum parcel area of less than one acre, fences in front yards shall not exceed fifty percent opacity. 
2.  In districts requiring a minimum parcel area of one acre, domestic fences in front yards shall not exceed fifty percent opacity. 
3.  Fences in side yards adjacent to road rights-of-way shall not exceed fifty percent opacity. 
4.  Horse fences shall not exceed fifty percent opacity. 
5.  Fences adjacent to public trails and paths in districts requiring a minimum parcel area of one acre or more shall not exceed fifty percent opacity. 
6.  Fence members shall not exceed a six inch width when viewed perpendicularly to the plane of the fence for fences subject to an opacity limit. 
7.  Retaining walls are exempt from opacity limits.

2.  The cross sections of posts must not exceed six inches by six inches; such posts shall not exceed four feet in height and shall be spaced no closer than five feet apart. 
3.  Six inch by six inch wire mesh may be attached to a horse fence but shall not exceed the height of the horse fence. Nothing else shall be attached to a horse fence that would violate the standards set forth in Section 18.43.060A and/or alter the visual characteristics of the horse fence. 
4.  Horse fence opacity shall not exceed fifty percent. See Section 18.43.040.A.4. 
5.  Horse fences shall not exceed four feet in height. See Section 18.43.030.B.2. 
B.  Gates attached to horse fences are exempted from Section 18.43.060.A.1.—3., but shall conform to height and opacity standards for horse fences and be of a similar design as a horse fence. 
C.  Horse fences that are also used as corral and pasture fences, must, in addition, comply with special requirements as set forth in the town stable ordinance 
(Ord. 2005-360, § 3, 2005; Ord. 1988-242 Section 2 (Ex. A) (part), 1988; Ord. 1967-80 Section 1 (6207.4), 1967; Ord. 2001-338 Section 3 (part), 2001).  
18.43.070 - Entryway features. 
Entryway features, including gates, must adhere to the setback requirements set forth in Section 18.42.016. 
(Ord. 2005-360, § 3, 2005)  
18.43.080 - Fence permits and administration. 
A. Fence permits are required for construction of all fences built within required yards, except as otherwise specified in this section. Fence permit applications shall be made on a form provided by the town planning staff and shall be accompanied by plans demonstrating the design and materials of the proposed fence, the location of the proposed fence and any associated landscaping. A fee shall be paid to cover the cost of review by town planning staff, or on referral, by the town planner. Prior to approving a fence permit, town planning staff shall give written notice to owners of adjoining properties of the permit application. Prior to acting on a permit, town planning staff shall review the proposed design and location in the field, review the plans for conformance with the zoning ordinance and design guidelines, and consider comments from owner(s) of adjoining properties. Town planning staff may take action on a permit or refer it to the ASCC. Written notification shall be given to owner(s) of adjoining properties at least six days prior to action by town planning staff or the ASCC. 
1.  Any town planning staff decision may be appealed within fifteen days of the decision by an applicant or an owner of adjacent property to the ASCC. 
2.  Any ASCC decision may be appealed within fifteen days of the decision by the applicant or an owner of adjacent property to the board of adjustment. 
B.  Fences within required yards that are no more than two feet in height, and no more than twenty feet in total length shall be exempt from this section but shall meet all other provisions of this chapter except Section 18.43.040 regarding opacity. 
C.  The ASCC shall have the authority to review existing fences and fence permit applications under the following conditions: 
1.  Upon referral from town planning staff, pursuant to Section 18.43.080A. 
2.  When acting on architectural review and site development permits, the ASCC shall consider and may require modifications to existing fencing on a property if the ASCC determines that there is a substantial modification to an existing residence or the site improvements of the property. If, in these situations, the ASCC determines that the existing fencing is not in conformity with current fencing standards, the ASCC may require conformity with the fencing regulations. In requiring conformity, the ASCC shall make the finding that the modified or replacement fencing will not result in an adverse effect on neighboring properties and reasonably adheres to the purposes of this chapter. 
3.  When a fence permit application demonstrates that the proposed fence cannot conform to the regulations given the conditions on the parcel, the ASCC may grant relief from the fence regulations. In making such determination, the ASCC shall as much as reasonably possible ensure the proposed fence achieves the purpose and principles of this chapter set forth in Section 18.43.010. 
4.  When a fence permit application is submitted for a proposed fence in the Mountainous-Residential (M-R) or Open-Area (O-A) zoning districts, the ASCC shall, with input from the conservation committee, make a determination of compliance based on the purposes of this chapter and the fence design guidelines adopted by the town council. 
D.  When a portion of a fence exceeding twenty-five percent of the total length of fencing within required yards on a property is damaged or voluntarily removed, any replacement fencing of that portion shall conform to the fence regulations pursuant to a fence permit. 
E.  A fence permit becomes null and void if not exercised within one year following the date the fence permit is approved, except: 
1.  Where a single project requires both a fence permit and an architectural review approval from the ASCC, and those permits are considered and issued together, the fence permit shall have the same expiration period as the architectural review approval.

CHAPTER 18.44 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 
Sections: 
 
18.44.010 - Purpose—Intention. 
Planned unit developments are permitted in order to allow diversification in use and in the relationships of various buildings, structures, and open spaces in building groups and variations in the allowable heights of buildings and structures, while insuring substantial compliance with the provisions of this title. In addition, planned unit developments are intended to achieve a higher quality of development through better adjustment to terrain and greater preservation of natural features than could otherwise be achieved, while still maintaining privacy for individual homesites. It is the intent of this chapter to require that adequate standards related to the public health, safety, and general welfare be observed without imposing undue restrictions on developers attempting to secure the advantages of comprehensive site planning for coordinating residential or commercial development. Where use is made of the planned unit development process, as provided in this chapter, a zoning permit shall not be issued for the development, or any part thereof, until the development has been approved as herein provided. 
(Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6111), 1967)  
18.44.020 - Applicability. 
The procedures set forth in Sections 18.44.030 through 18.44.090 shall apply to the establishment of a planned unit development in any zoning district wherein it is a permitted use. 
(Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6111.1), 1967)  
18.44.030 - Application. 
Application shall be made for a conditional use permit in accordance with Chapter 18.72 and shall be accompanied by the required information.

18.44.040 - Application—Review and action. 
Action on application for a conditional use permit to allow the establishment of a planned unit development shall be as specified in Chapters 18.72 and 18.76. Plans and other information submitted with the application shall be referred to the town planner, building inspector, town engineer, a member of the architectural and site control commission, and the fire chief, for review. These officials, through the town planner, shall report their findings and recommendations to the planning commission. 
(Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6111.3), 1967)  
18.44.050 - General requirements and exceptions. 
Planned unit developments in all districts shall comply with the following requirements: 
A.  The parcel on which the development is to be located shall be in one ownership and include an area of at least ten acres or be bounded on all sides by streets, public open spaces, boundary lines of less restricted zoning districts, or other conditions which the planning commission finds makes the parcel more desirable to develop as a single unit. 
B.  The proposed development shall be designed to produce an environment of stable and desirable character in harmony with the character of the surrounding area. 
C.  The arrangement of buildings on the site shall be such as to provide standards of light, air, and privacy at least equivalent to the standards required under this title for lots developed individually. The spacing between main buildings shall be at least equivalent to the spacing which would be required between buildings similarly developed under the terms of this title on separate parcels, due consideration being given to building height and to the openness normally afforded by intervening streets. In R-1 districts this requirement for space between buildings may be waived if the planning commission finds that reduction or elimination of space between main buildings will result in significant advantages in preserving natural features and adaptation to terrain, and provide standards of light, air and privacy at least equivalent to those otherwise prevailing in the district. 
D.  The development shall not produce a volume of traffic in excess of the capacity for which the access streets are designed. Vehicular entrances and exits shall be carefully located and designed to minimize traffic hazards. The unit development plan shall provide for safe, convenient internal circulation, pedestrian and vehicular. 
E.  A common area which is intended to serve a planned unit development shall be held as one parcel in which the owner of each parcel served by the common area in the planned unit development shall have an undivided interest. An appropriate open space or conservation easement covering the common area and suitable to the town shall be dedicated to the town. Guarantees suitable to the town shall be made to assure the continued maintenance of such common areas. All residential open space preserves shown on the town general plan shall be designated as common areas at the time of development and shall be treated as required by this chapter. 
F.  A planned unit development in a P-C district shall conform with the approved general development plan and general development schedule for the P-C district in which located. 
G.  A planned unit development in any district other than a P-C district shall conform with all requirements of this title for such district except as otherwise specifically permitted by this chapter. Planned unit developments in districts other than P-C districts shall in addition to other requirements comply with the following: 
1.  Yards not less in dimension than required in the combining district in which situated shall be provided along the parcel lines bounding each planned unit development.

I.  Multifamily Affordable Housing. A residential planned unit development may be developed to provide multifamily affordable housing consistent with Section 2482 of the Housing Element of the General Plan. 
J.  Housing in C-C and A-P Districts. In C-C and A-P districts on those parcels identified in either the Nathhorst Triangle Area Plan or the Village Square Area Plan as suitable for housing, detached or attached single-family homes may be permitted. The PUD shall establish the number of dwelling units, floor area, impervious surface, parking, height and setback limits which are compatible with adjoining and nearby existing and permitted uses. The distances between main buildings as provided for in Section 18.44.050 may be modified in the same way as that section permits modifications in R-1 districts. Such permit may also establish limits on occupancy of such dwellings. A PUD for this purpose may be combined with a commercial or administrative-professional PUD.

a.  Locations conforming with subsections 1. or 2. of this section do not provide a significantly greater amount of safety from fault offset or other geologic hazards than a location within the fault setback; or 
b.  There is no location for rebuilding which conforms to the fault setback, required side or rear yards, or such yards as might be modified by approval of a variance; or 
c.  Total cost to a property owner to conform to the requirements of subsections 1. or 2. exceeds thirty-five percent of the current appraised value of the structure(s) prior to damage. A property owner, in addition, shall submit financial information comparing the total costs of rebuilding the damaged building(s) in the existing location(s) with the total costs of rebuilding a comparable building(s) in a location conforming with the requirements of this section. Total costs shall include but not be limited to geologic and structural engineering studies, design costs, demolition costs and construction costs. The current value and other financial information shall be prepared by an independent appraiser retained by the property owner and approved by the town council. 
4.  In the event a lesser setback is authorized by subdivision 3. a., b. or c. of this section, the amount of setback reduction shall be determined by the planning commission upon submission of such geologic information as the town may require and as advised by the town geologist. The reduction shall be the minimum necessary to allow the rebuilding of a similar building to the one that was damaged. If reconstruction takes place over a fault trace or fault rupture zone, an engineering study shall be submitted by the applicant to determine the risk of collapse from fault rupture and to specify measures to reduce such risk to an acceptable level. Such measures shall be adhered to in building construction. A replacement building shall conform to building code and site development requirements in effect at the time of replacement. 
5.  The terms "rebuilt" or "rebuilding," as used in this section do not necessarily mean that a building will be allowed to be rebuilt in the same size and configuration as it existed prior to damage if modifications are necessary to increase safety from earthquake faulting or other geologic hazards. 
6.  The provisions of this section do not and shall not be interpreted to preclude rebuilding on a parcel due solely to a lack of compliance with fault setbacks, provided that, a building for human occupancy shall not be built across an active fault trace. The final design for rebuilding requires approval by the town council. In such a case, the best possible geotechnical and structural engineering solution will be required. 
(Ord. 2010-387 § 2, 2010; Ord. 2008-374 § 2, 2008) 
Editor's note— 
Ord. 2010-387, § 2, adopted Oct. 27, 2010, changed the title of § 18.46.050 from "Replacement of buildings in earthquake fault setbacks" to "Repair, reconstruction or replacement of involuntarily damaged buildings in earthquake fault setbacks."  
18.46.051 - Voluntary repair, alteration and remodeling of buildings in earthquake fault setbacks. 
The following provisions relate to buildings for human occupancy in existence prior to the effective date of this provision (October 27, 2010) that do not conform to special building setback lines - EF (earthquake fault) as provided for in Section 18.58.030. 
A.  All changes to buildings addressed in [subsections] B. through D. below may not exceed the same height, floor area, building coverage, yard, special building setback other than for earthquake faults, and impervious surface limits that existed prior to change or damage except as otherwise permitted by [subsection] C. below. 
B.  Buildings within fault setbacks that cross a fault trace may be repaired, altered and remodeled but not enlarged provided the costs, other than for seismic upgrades, do not exceed fifty percent of the appraised value of the building, and the construction work incorporates seismic strengthening as recommended by the building inspector and town geologist as being reasonably commensurate with the work subject to the building permit. 
C.  Buildings within fault setbacks that do not cross a fault trace may be repaired, altered, remodeled and enlarged by up to four hundred square feet provided the costs, other than for seismic upgrades, do not exceed fifty percent of the appraised value of the building, and the construction work incorporates seismic strengthening as recommended by the building inspector and town geologist as being reasonably commensurate with the work subject to the building permit. Such increase in floor area shall not cause the building to exceed the floor area limits of the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of the application. 
D.  Buildings that cross a fault setback may be repaired, altered and remodeled provided the costs, other than for seismic upgrades, do not exceed fifty percent of the appraised value of the building. Also, an addition outside of the setback is permitted provided the existing building and the addition consist of two buildings that are structurally independent or are of appropriate design so that fault movement under the building partially within the fault setback likely will not result in fault-caused damage to the addition as determined by the town geologist and building inspector. Changes to the building partially within the setback and the addition should conform to building code standards in effect at the time of the building permit application, and construction work shall incorporate seismic strengthening as recommended by the building inspector and town geologist as being reasonably commensurate with the work subject to the building permit. An addition outside the fault setback shall not cause the existing building and addition to cumulatively exceed the floor area limits in effect at the time of the application. 
(Ord. 2010-387 § 4, 2010)  
18.46.060 - Conditional uses. 
Except for those conditional uses permitted under this title for which a use permit was granted by the town prior to the adoption of the regulations codified in this title, any use existing on August 17, 1967, which is listed as a conditional use in the district wherein located, shall be and remain a nonconforming use until a conditional use permit is obtained as provided in this title. 
(Ord. 2008-374 § 2, 2008)  
18.46.070 - No expansion of a nonconforming use. 
No existing structure occupied by a use not permitted by this title in the district in which such structure is located shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, substituted or structurally altered except when required to do so by law or order, unless the use thereof is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such structure is located, except as herein provided. The land area occupied by a nonconforming use on any parcel shall not be increased. No nonconforming use shall be expanded, changed in character, intensified or change its hours of operation except as set forth in Section 18.46.080 below. 
(Ord. 2008-374 § 2, 2008)  
18.46.080 - Substitution, change or extension of a nonconforming use. 
A. When authorized by the planning commission as a conditional use, in accordance with the provision of Chapter 18.72, the substitution of one nonconforming use for another nonconforming use of a similar or less intensive character may be made. 
B.  When authorized by the planning commission as a conditional use, in accordance with the provision of Chapter 18.72, the character, intensity and hours of operation of a nonconforming use may be modified. 
C.  Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, such conforming use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use. 
D.  When authorized by the planning commission as a conditional use, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 18.72, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout those existing parts of a building which were manifestly designed or arranged for such nonconforming use prior to the date when such use of such building became nonconforming, provided that no structural alterations, except those required by law, are made therein. 
(Ord. 2008-374 § 2, 2008)  
18.46.090 - Discontinuance due to cessation of a nonconforming use. 
A. Structure designed for a nonconforming use. Where the nonconforming use of a structure, which was originally designed for a nonconforming use, has ceased for twelve months or more, such structure shall not thereafter be put to a nonconforming use. 
B.  Structure not designed for nonconforming use. Where the nonconforming use of a structure, which was originally designed for a conforming use, has ceased for six months or more, such structure shall not thereafter be put to a nonconforming use. 
C.  Nonconforming use of land. Where the nonconforming use of land involving no structures other than minor structures such as fences and signs or buildings less than four hundred square feet in floor area, has ceased for ninety days or more, such land shall not thereafter be put to a nonconforming use. 
D.  Cessation for use defined. A use shall be deemed to have ceased when it has been discontinued either temporarily or permanently, whether with the intent to abandon the use or not.

 a) To determine the maximum amount of floor area or impervious surface permitted on a parcel, the figures from Table 1 must be inserted in Tables 1A and 1B to determine the Adjusted Maximum Floor Area and Adjusted Maximum Impervious surface. The Adjusted Maximum Floor Area and Adjusted Maximum Impervious Surface figures then supersede the Maximum Floor Area and Maximum Impervious Surface figures from Table 1. 
 b) For parcels over 7-1/2 acres and up to 10 acres, the floor area can be increased at the rate of 216 square feet per acre to a maximum of 10,121 square feet, and the impervious surface can be increased at the rate of 794 square feet per acre to a maximum of 21,807 square feet. For parcels 10 acres and larger, floor areas and impervious surfaces may exceed these limitations when a conditional use permit is granted therefor as provided in Chapter 18.72. The resultant floor area and impervious surface figures are to be inserted in Tables 1A and 1B to determine the Adjusted Maximum Floor Area and Adjusted Maximum Impervious Surface.

18.48.020 - Maximum adjusted floor area. 
The architectural and site control commission may allow the eighty-five percent figure stipulated in Line 7 of Table 1A to be increased up to a maximum of one hundred percent when it can make all of the findings set forth below: 
A.  Any one of the following: 
1.  The larger building will result in a superior design for the property in terms of grading, tree removal and use of the property than would be possible without the requested increase. 
2.  The larger building is appropriate because steep slopes, areas of unstable geology or areas subject to flooding so limit development of the property that in order to develop a reasonable plan for the property it is necessary to concentrate more than eighty-five percent of the floor area in a single building. 
3.  The larger building is appropriate because the reduction in permitted floor area caused by steep slopes, unstable geology and/or areas subject to flooding so reduces the floor area permitted for any single building that in order to develop a reasonable plan for the property it is necessary to concentrate more than eighty-five percent of the floor area in a single building. 
B.  The building will not impact significant views enjoyed by neighboring properties to any greater extent than would a design for the project without the increased floor area. 
C.  The building will not in any substantial way negatively affect neighboring properties to any greater extent than would a design for the project without the increased floor area. 
D.  The building will be in keeping with the character and quality of the neighborhood. 
(Ord. 1998-312 § 3, 1998; Ord. 1995-285 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1995)  
18.48.030 - One-time increase. 
Any single-family residential building or related accessory building existing on October 25, 1995, may be increased one time up to a total of five percent of the existing floor area or one hundred fifty square feet, whichever is smaller, regardless of whether such increase exceeds the floor area limit that applies to the property. This provision shall not be applied to accessory dwelling unit maximums as described in subsections (i.) and (ii.) of Section 18.36.040.A.4.b.

CHAPTER 18.50 - PARCEL AREA 
Sections: 
 
18.50.010 - Conformance with requirements. 
Except as hereinafter provided, every structure in which is conducted a principal use shall be located upon a parcel having an area not less than the minimum required in this chapter for the district in which the parcel is located. 
(Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6201 (part)), 1967)  
18.50.020 - Determination of parcel area. 
Parcel area is the total of the area measured in a horizontal plane, within the parcel lines bounding the parcel, exclusive of: 
A.  Easements for streets or driveways which are not for the exclusive use of the parcel on which any such easement is located; 
B.  Any portion of an individual accessway in excess of five percent of the parcel area required in the district. 
(Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6201 (A)), 1967)  
18.50.030 - Exemptions from area and dimension requirements. 
The following are recognized as parcels for the purpose of use and development under provisions of this title even though less in dimension or area than required by this title and may be used by the owner of the parcel or his successor in interest as a building site for a principal use permitted in the district provided that all other regulations for the district are complied with: 
A.  Any lot or unit of land established prior to October 6, 1937 which has not been merged by the town; 
B.  Any lot in a subdivision established in full compliance with subdivision regulations in force at the time, provided the subdivision map was recorded subsequent to October 6, 1937 and provided the lot has not been merged by the town; 
C.  Any unit of land caused by the merger of lots or units of land by Resolution No. 1137-1985 of the town council or as may otherwise be merged by the town council. 
(Ord. 1988-229 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1988: Ord. 1979-166 § 9 (part), 1979; Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6201 (B)), 1967)  
18.50.040 - Slope density (S-D) combining districts. 
For lands included in an S-D combining district, the values set forth in Table 3, as based on the formulae given therein, apply in lieu of the values for minimum parcel areas set forth in Table 1 in Section 18.48.010. Column one, gross area per dwelling unit, shall be used for planned unit development, and column two, required minimum parcel area, shall be used in all other cases. Gross residential area is the total area devoted exclusively to the use of the residents plus all trail easements and roads rights-of-way. Net residential area is the total area devoted exclusively to the use of the residents. Where any lands in a planned unit development are in excess of fifty percent slope, such lands may be assigned a slope of fifty percent and the number of dwelling units permissible on the fifty percent and over lands may be added to the number permissible on the balance of the parcel to obtain the total permissible on the entire parcel. In other than planned unit developments, lands in excess of fifty percent slope may be considered as fifty percent in determining the average slope of the parcel.

18.50.050 - Planned unit developments. 
A. The number of dwelling units permissible in any planned unit development shall be determined as follows: 
1.  In areas within a slope density combining district, the gross residential area shall be divided by the required gross residential area per dwelling unit indicated in Table 3 for the applicable slope category; 
2.  In all areas not included in a slope density combining district, the net residential area shall be divided by the minimum parcel area required for the district or combining district in which located. 
B.  Where individual parcels or building sites are to be sold or leased within any planned unit development, the net area for individual parcels or building sites shall be as required by Sections 18.50.010 through 18.50.030 except as modified below: 
1.  In R-E and M-R districts the planning commission may authorize the net area for individual parcels or building sites to be reduced to twenty thousand square feet if the commission finds that development results in less disturbance to the natural terrain and vegetation and produces a development more in keeping with the objectives of this title and the Portola Valley general plan than could overwise have been obtained. 
2.  In R-1 districts the net area may be reduced to not less than one-fourth of that required in the combining district in which the planned unit development is located but not less than four thousand square feet in any case, provided the planning commission makes the findings required in paragraph B (1) of this section.

18.50.060 - Planned unit developments—Areas of land movement potential. 
Where a planned unit development includes area in categories Pmw, Ms, Pd, Pdf, Md, Psc or Pf as shown on the Ground Movement Potential Map of Portola Valley adopted by council Resolution 2506-2010 and as thereafter amended, the maximum number of parcels permitted shall be determined by either of the two following procedures at the option of the applicant: 
A.  The applicant may compute the maximum number of dwelling units permitted by procedures set forth in Sections 18.50.040 and 18.50.050 except that for those lands in one of the land movement potential categories enumerated in this section, the number of dwelling units shall not exceed ten percent of the number permitted by procedures set forth in Sections 18.50.040 and 18.50.050. 
B.  The applicant may design a conventional subdivision, one for which a planned unit development is not required, pursuant to the purposes and standards of the subdivision ordinance, to determine the number of lots possible on the property. If the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning commission that the purposes and standards of the subdivision ordinance are complied with in the design and that the subdivision could reasonably be expected to be constructed as proposed, the number of lots thus determined shall then be the maximum number permitted in the planned unit development.

(Ord. 1997-295 § 3, 1997)  
CHAPTER 18.54 - BUILDING BULK 
Sections: 
 
18.54.010 - Compliance with height limits. 
Except as otherwise authorized by this chapter, each structure shall comply with the height limit specified in this title for the district in which the structure is located. See Tables 1 and 2 of Section 18.48.010. 
(Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6203.1 (part)), 1967)  
18.54.020 - Measurement of height. 
A. 1. Building height is the vertical distance at any point from the natural ground level which existed prior to grading for any building, or from the building pad if excavated below natural ground level, whichever elevation is lower, to the highest part of the building directly above. 
2.  When a retaining wall is incorporated into a building and earth is backfilled against the retaining wall, the height of the building shall be referenced to the extension of contour lines from the ground along the perimeter of the building. In no case shall the extended contour lines exceed the contour lines established by the natural ground. 
3.  Maximum building height is the vertical distance between the lowest point of contact with the finished ground surface to the highest point of the building or its appurtenance. 
B.  In combining districts 7.5M, 15M and 20M no portion of a building shall intercept a theoretical plane which starts at the natural ground surface at the property line and increases in height at a ratio of one and one-half vertical to one horizontal up to a maximum horizontal distance of twenty-four feet from the property line provided, however, that such provision shall in no case prohibit any portion of a building fifteen feet or less in height as measured from the finished ground surface adjoining the wall of the building nearest said portion of the building. 
C.  Fence height measurement is subject to the provisions set forth in Section 18.43.030.A. 
D.  Height of other structures shall be determined in the same manner as height of buildings. 
(Ord. 2005-360, § 4, 2005; Ord. 1988-242 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1988: Ord. 1979-166 § 13 (part), 1979; Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6203.1 (A)), 1967; )  
18.54.030 - Exceptions to height limits. 
A. Chimneys, flag poles, and radio and television antennas may exceed the height limits established for the district in which they are located provided they do not exceed a height of fifty feet, unless a greater height is authorized under the terms of a conditional use permit. 
B.  Power distribution poles and lines, where permitted in accordance with subsection B of Section 18.36.010, may exceed the height limits established in this title for the district; provided they do not exceed a height of fifty feet, unless a greater height is authorized under the terms of a conditional use permit as provided in Chapter 18.72. 
C.  In districts in which a lower height limit is established places of assembly in schools, churches, and other permitted public and semipublic buildings may be erected to a height not exceeding seventy-five feet provided that the rear and side yards shall be increased as specified in Section 18.52.030. 
D.  Upon the securing of a conditional use permit as provided in Chapter 18.72, towers or lofts needed for utility or communication purposes or required for operations in conjunction with a permitted principal use, architectural features, such as spires or belfries, flag poles, and similar structures may be constructed and used to a greater height than the limit established for the district in which the structure is located. 
E.  Exceptions to height requirements may be permitted as a part of an approved planned unit development or a planned community district. 
(Ord. 1997-295 § 4, 1997: Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6203.1 (B)), 1967)  
18.54.040 - Building coverage—Limits—Exceptions. 
No building or buildings shall be constructed or enlarged so as to cover a greater percentage of the parcel than the building coverage limit established in this title for the district in which such parcel is located except as authorized below. 
A.  Building coverage is the percent of total parcel area covered by all buildings on the parcel. The area covered shall be measured in a horizontal plane and may exclude the features enumerated in Sections 18.52.040 through 18.52.110 to the extent such features are permitted to extend into required yards and courts by those sections. Uncovered decks which are no more than two feet above the average level of the finished ground surface shall not be included in figuring building coverage. Average level of the finished ground surface for the purpose of measuring the height of decks is the average of the highest and lowest points of the ground surface directly below the deck. 
B.  Exceptions to coverage limitations may be permitted as a part of a planned unit development of a planned community district. 
C.  On legally buildable parcels with a total parcel area less than the minimum parcel area required for the district in which located, the building coverage may be further increased as follows: 
Permitted building coverage in percent = coverage limit × factor 
with 
Factor = 1 + 0.5 ( MPAR-APA / MPAR ) 
where MPAR = Minimum parcel area required, 
APA = actual parcel area, 
and 1.25 is the maximum value permitted for the factor. 
(Ord. 1969-95 § 2, 1969; Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6203.2), 1967)  
18.54.050 - Floor area. 
A. For residential uses, the floor area is the total floor area, as measured from exterior walls, for all buildings on a parcel. For nonresidential uses, the floor area ratio is the ratio of total net floor area to the area of the parcel on which it is located. For the purpose of this chapter, net floor area is the area of all floors included within surrounding walls off a building or portions thereof, exclusive of vent shafts, courts and floor area permanently allocated for parking or loading spaces. 
B.  The floor area of a basement, whose volume does not exceed that which would be obtained by constructing a basement with a ceiling height not exceeding twelve feet directly under the first floor of the building above, will not be counted as floor area. Any additional basement floor area will be counted as floor area. 
C.  Exceptions to floor area ratio limits may be permitted as part of a planned unit development or a planned community district. 
(Ord. 1999-323 § 2, 1999; Ord. 1995-285 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1995; Ord. 1991-263 § 9, 1991; Ord. 1988-242 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 1988: Ord. 1979-166 § 13 (part), 1979: Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6203.3), 1967)  
18.54.051 - Floor area—Conditional use permit modifications. 
When conditional use permits are approved for the uses listed below, the planning commission or town council may allow floor areas in excess of those specified in Section 18.54.050, which uses were in existence as of January 1, 1990, when it finds there is no reasonable way to meet the normal floor area standards and that the use as approved will still in all other ways meet the requirements of Chapter 18.72. The deviation from normal floor area standards shall be only to the extent necessary to render the project reasonable and acceptable by the planning commission or town council. The uses subject to this provision are as follows: 
Sections 18.12.030 D 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 and 18.36.020 A and C. 
(Ord. 1990-254 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 1990)  
18.54.052 - Floor area limitations—Commercial and office uses. 
A. Commercial and office uses shall not have gross floor areas that exceed the following limitations: 
1.  Offices of all types, except medical and dental offices—1,500 square feet 
2.  Medical and dental offices—2,000 square feet 
3.  Physical therapy and fitness training—3,000 square feet 
4.  Consumer services—2,000 square feet

8.  Automotive repair—4,000 square feet 
9.  Hardware—5,000 square feet 
10.  Foodstores—12,000 square feet 
B.  If the approving authority is presented with clear and convincing evidence that a use will derive in excess of a majority of its clientele from the town and its spheres of influence, floor area limitations may be increased up to twenty percent to accommodate the use. 
C.  Commercial and office uses that were approved by the town prior to August 24, 2001, and that exceed the floor area limitations of Section 18.54.052A. may continue to occupy the same floor area in the same location as approved. Any such existing use, however, may be increased beyond the standards of Section 18.54.052A. only pursuant to the provisions of Section 18.54.052B. If the type of approved use changes, the new use shall conform to the standards of Section 18.54.052A.

CHAPTER 18.56 - IMPERVIOUS SURFACING AND LANDSCAPING 
Sections: 
 
18.56.010 - Impervious surfaces. 
The maximum area or percent of any parcel of land that may be occupied by impervious surfaces is specified in Tables 1 and 2 of Section 18.48.010. Impervious surfaces are meant to include surfaces that will not allow or will greatly reduce the penetration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces include the following: concrete, asphalt, bricks, paving stones, swimming pools, roofs, "turf stone," plastic sheeting, compacted gravel and rock areas, corrals and similar surfaces. Impervious surfaces are measured in a horizontal plane. Impervious surfaces may exclude: 
A.  Features enumerated in Section 18.52.070 to the extent which such features are permitted to extend into required yards by such section; 
B.  Roofs of all buildings, except for overhangs which exceed six feet in width; 
C.  That portion of a driveway which is further than one hundred feet from a residence as measured along the driveway; 
D.  Impervious surfaces beneath roof overhangs which are counted as impervious surfaces. 
(Ord. 1995-285 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1995; Ord. 1989-244 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1989: Ord. 1988-242 § 2 Exh. A (part), 1988: Ord. 1979-166 § 14, 1979: Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6204), 1967)  
18.56.011 - Impervious surfaces—Conditional use permit modifications. 
When conditional use permits are approved for the uses listed below, which uses were in existence as of January 1, 1990, the planning commission or town council may allow impervious surfaces in excess of those specified in Section 18.56.010 when it finds there is no reasonable way to meet the normal impervious surface standards and that the use as approved will still in all other ways meet the requirements of Chapter 18.72. The deviation from normal impervious surface standards shall be only to the extent necessary to render the project reasonable and acceptable by the planning commission or town council. The uses subject to this provision are as follows: Sections 18.12.030 D 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 and 18.36.020 A and C. 
(Ord. 1990-254 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 1990)  
18.56.020 - Required landscaping. 
A. Front Yards. In other than residential zoning districts, planting in required front yards shall conform with any roadside planting standards adopted by the conservation committee. At least twenty-five percent of such required front yard shall be landscaped, such area to have a minimum dimension of five feet. 
B.  Structures Which Require Conditional Use Permits. Landscaping shall be located in close proximity to structures in order to improve appearance, obscure unattractive features, or effect visual separation from parking lots. 
C.  Adjoining Parcels Within C-C and A-P Districts. Landscaping in such districts shall present an overall unified appearance. To this end, landscape design and planting for contiguous properties shall be coordinated, especially where planting beds adjoin. 
D.  Parcels with Frontage on Alpine Road and Portola Road. Parcels with frontage on the following roads if planted with trees and/or shrubs, shall be planted with only such trees and shrubs as are on a plan approved by the conservation committee. This provision shall apply to the portion of the parcel within seventy-five feet of the road right-of-way: 
1.  Alpine Road in the section from the northern town limits to Portola Road. 
2.  Portola Road. 
E.  Parcels in C-C and A-P Districts, Parcels in C-C and A-P districts shall have a minimum percent of the parcel as specified below with a natural vegetative cover or in a landscaped condition. Such areas shall not be developed for use by motor vehicles, occupied by buildings or covered by paving: 
1.  C-C (community commercial) district - thirty percent; 
2.  A-P (administrative-professional) district - forty percent.

CHAPTER 18.58 - SPECIAL SETBACK LINES[4] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. 2017-419, § 3, adopted May 24, 2017, changed the title of Ch. 18.58 from "Special Building Setback Lines" to read as herein set out. 
 
18.58.010 - Intention. 
Special setback lines are intended to regulate the location of structures where special features such as scenic roads, geologically hazardous areas, and floodplains require setback regulations to those otherwise specified in this title. 
(Ord. 2017-419 § 4, 2017; Ord. 1973-119 § 3 (part), 1973: Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6209), 1967)  
18.58.020 - Special setback lines—S (scenic). 
A. Purpose. Special setback lines—S are established along streets to assure the provision of space for light, air, safety, circulation, and visual amenity, and to permit or require adjustment in the location of structures to observe unusual physical conditions. Special setback lines shall be adopted and amended in conformance with the requirements of Chapter 18.74 and when adopted shall be set forth on the zoning map. 
B.  Requirements. No structure shall be located closer to a street parcel line than the special setback line. In any district where the least depth or least width of yard required for such distance is greater or less than the distance set forth for any special setback line, the distance established by the special setback line shall govern. 
C.  Measurement. The location of a special setback line shall be established by measurements in feet measured at right angles from the parcel line of the subject parcel. 
D.  Special Building Setback Lines—S Adopted. 
1.  Skyline Boulevard—No structure shall be closer than two hundred feet to the right-of-way of Skyline Boulevard, provided, however, that the architectural and site control commission may allow a reduction of the setback to no less than one hundred feet when it finds that in such a location the proposed structure will not be visible from the right-of-way of Skyline Boulevard. 
2.  Alpine Road—No structure shall be located closer than seventy-five feet to the right-of-way of Alpine Road in that section of Alpine Road lying between the northerly town limits and Portola Road. 
3.  Portola Road—No structure shall be located closer to the right-of-way of Portola Road in that section from the intersection with Alpine Road to the northwesterly town limits than as stipulated below: 
a.  In zoning districts requiring a minimum parcel area of one acre or larger, no structure shall be closer to the Portola Road right-of-way than fifty feet; however, where a parcel has a side or rear parcel line contiguous with the Portola Road right-of-way, an accessory structure may come within twenty-five feet of the right-of-way provided the architectural and site control commission finds the structure will not be seen from Portola Road or that existing and/or proposed planting consistent with the character and quality of the Portola Road corridor will largely obscure the structure. 
b.  In zoning districts requiring a minimum parcel area less than one acre, a one-story house shall observe a minimum setback of thirty-five feet and any second story addition thereto shall observe a minimum setback of forty-five feet; alternatively, a two-story house shall observe a minimum setback of forty feet. Structures which are not buildings shall adhere to the same setback requirements. Where a parcel has a side or rear parcel line contiguous with the Portola Road right-of-way, an accessory structure may come within twenty feet of the right-of-way provided the architectural and site control commission finds the structure will not be seen from Portola Road or that existing and/or proposed planting consistent with the character and quality of the Portola Road corridor will largely obscure the structure. 
c.  Structures existing as of the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this subdivision (August 28, 1991), which do not comply with the setback requirements described herein are deemed conforming structures and are not subject to the provisions contained in Chapter 18.46. For such a structure, the three-dimensional space it occupies which does not comply with the setbacks stipulated in subsection D.3.a. and b. of this section becomes a building envelope. Remodeling and rebuilding may occur within such a building envelope subject to normal design review requirements provided for in this section. In addition, the architectural and site control commission may allow architectural details to extend up to two feet from any wall surface on no more than ten percent of the building perimeter within the setbacks in subsection D.3.a. and b. of this section when such details will better ensure compatibility with the character and quality of the Portola Road corridor. This provision is not meant to allow any new construction or use in an existing structure deemed conforming under this subsection, without the required permits; all changes shall be subject to review as required in Chapter 18.46. 
(Ord. 2017-419 § 5, 2017; Ord. 1991-265 § 1, 1991; Ord. 1973-119 § 3 (part), 1973; Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6209.1), 1967) 
Editor's note— 
Ord. 2017-419, § 5, adopted May 24, 2017, changed the title of § 18.58.020 from "Special building setback lines—S (scenic)" to read as herein set out.  
18.58.030 - Special building setbacks along earthquake faults. 
A. Purpose. Special building setbacks are established along earthquake fault traces to minimize the potential loss of property and life resulting from differential movement along such traces caused by tectonic forces. 
B.  Maps. The town geologic map and ground movement potential map, adopted by Resolution 2279-2006, as amended from time to time, provides the basis for required fault setbacks. Two types of setbacks are established. One type is for setbacks along the San Andreas Fault. The other type is for setbacks from fault (other than the San Andreas). 
C.  Setbacks from the San Andreas Fault. The town ground movement potential map establishes required building setbacks along the active traces of the San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas Fault is a known hazard for development and it is prudent to preclude construction of buildings for human occupancy within these zones. 
1.  Delineation of Earthquake Fault Zones. Earthquake fault zones define the areas along faults in which primary fault rupture may occur. The map, ground movement potential adopted pursuant to town council Resolution 2279-2006, as amended, defines the boundaries of the fault zones and labels them Pf. Where the location of the fault is known and the pattern of ground breakage is parallel to the direction of the trace, the trace is classified as a "known" trace and shown in a solid line. Where the location of the trace is less well known and the pattern of expected ground breakage is parallel to the direction of the trace, the trace is classified as an "inferred" trace and is shown in a dashed line. Where the pattern of ground breakage results in an en-echelon pattern, the trace is identified on the map as an "en-echelon" trace and shown as a series of short lines at an angle to the general alignment of the trace. An "en-echelon" trace consists of relatively short ruptures, on the order of forty feet in length, oriented obliquely to the general fault trend. 
2.  Required Setbacks for Buildings for Human Occupancy. The boundaries of the Pf zones constitute the required building setback lines for buildings for human occupancy. Setbacks are based on the following measurements taken at a right angle from the fault trace. Where the location of the trace is "known", the boundary of the zone is set back from the trace fifty feet from the center line of the trace. Where the location of the trace is "inferred", the boundary of the zone is set back one hundred feet from the center line of the trace. Where the trace is characterized as an "en-echelon" trace, the boundary of the zone is set back one hundred feet from the center line of the trace. 
3.  Buildings not intended for Human Occupancy. The following buildings not intended for human occupancy are allowed within fault setbacks: 
a.  Buildings that do not exceed one hundred twenty square feet and are used as a tool shed, an ornamental garden structure, an animal shade structure, an agricultural building or for a similar nature and use. 
b.  Other non-habitable buildings not exceeding a floor area of one hundred twenty square feet, and are of a similar nature and use may be permitted by staff or by the planning commission upon referral by staff. 
D.  Setbacks from Faults (other than the San Andreas). The town ground movement potential map shows traces noted as "fault (other than the San Andreas)." While the location and future movement of these faults is less certain than for the San Andreas Fault, it is still prudent to make certain that buildings for human occupancy do not cross such faults. 
1.  Construction of new buildings for human occupancy within one hundred feet of such mapped fault traces shall be supported by a site-specific geologic investigation that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the town geologist that the structure is not underlain by the suspected fault. This investigation must include recommendations for specific geotechnical measures, including appropriate seismic design criteria and minimum setback requirements, to mitigate potential adverse impact from the mapped fault trace and the estimated potential for some degree of displacement along the fault trace alignment. 
2.  Construction of new buildings not for human occupancy shall comply with required front, side and rear setbacks. 
E.  Modification of Requirements. When geologic studies acceptable to the planning commission demonstrate that delineations of the San Andreas Fault setback zones or the location of faults (other than the San Andreas) are incorrect, the planning commission may approve modifications to the geologic map and/or the ground movement potential map. 
(Ord. 2010-387 § 8, 2010; Ord. 1988-227 § 1, 1988; Ord. 1973-119 § 3 (part), 1973; Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6209.2), 1967) 
Editor's note— 
Ord. 2010-387, § 8, adopted Oct. 27, 2010, changed the title of § 18.58.030 from "Special building setback lines—EF (earthquake fault)" to "Special building setbacks along earthquake faults."  
CHAPTER 18.59 - CREEK SETBACKS 
Sections: 
 
18.59.010 - Purposes of creek setbacks. 
A. The overall purpose of this chapter is to improve the quality of creek bank protection measures used on town creeks, discourage practices that pose a risk to property improvements and neighboring properties, and protect the unique scenic qualities and habitat values of the creek environment that sustain wildlife by furnishing habitation, freshwater and migration corridors. It is envisioned that this chapter will benefit creekside property owners, residents of the town and region, and the overall environmental quality of the creeks and adjacent habitats. The measures are intended to help ensure that, over time, changes within creek setbacks will help restore the creeks and creeksides to a healthy natural environment. 
B.  The specific purposes of the setbacks are: 
1.  To keep new buildings out of range of potential creekbank failure and flooding. 
2.  To provide for the review of modifications or replacements of existing structures and impervious surface areas within creek setbacks in order to prevent further encroachment, and to encourage decreasing existing encroachments when modifications or replacements take place. 
3.  To restrict new structures in creek setbacks to those deemed necessary for creekbank stabilization projects, utility crossings, roads and driveways. 
4.  To retain adequate space adjacent to creek banks for access and work space to replace failing bank protections; to remove obstructions that pose a risk of flooding; and to facilitate bank protection projects utilizing state-of-the art practices, such as grading to achieve more stable bank angles and biotechnical or bioengineered designs. 
5.  To retain adequate space adjacent to creekbanks to allow wildlife movement and migration. 
6.  To protect creekside vegetation that stabilizes the soil and reduces flow velocities, erosion, sedimentation and creekbank failure. 
7.  To protect creekside vegetation as wildlife habitat for those species (song birds, waterfowl, mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians) dependent on creeks and their flanking native vegetation. 
8.  To protect water quality and creekside vegetation for shading and cooling of creek water to provide an environment supportive of trout, other fish, amphibians and invertebrates. 
9.  To implement the policies of the general plan that designate creek corridors as sensitive areas providing important aquatic and terrestrial wildlife habitat and that require all new subdivisions and site development proposals to contain setback areas sufficient to buffer wildlife inhabiting the creek corridor from the impact of development. 
(Ord. 2007-369 § 1, 2007)  
18.59.020 - Creeks subject to creek setback provisions. 
The following creeks are subject to the creek setback provisions in this chapter: Los Trancos Creek, Corte Madera Creek and Sausal Creek. 
(Ord. 2007-369 § 1, 2007)  
18.59.030 - Creek setbacks. 
A. For building permits and site development permits, setbacks may be measured from either the top of creek bank or ordinary high water mark (see definitions under Sections 18.59.040 and 18.59.050 below) at the option of the property owner: 
1.  Parcels less than one acre in size - Thirty feet from top of bank, or thirty-five feet from ordinary high water mark. 
2.  Parcels of one acre to two and one-half acres—Forty-five feet from top of bank or fifty feet from ordinary high water mark. 
3.  Parcels of two and one-half acres or more—Fifty-five feet from top of bank or sixty feet from ordinary high water mark. 
B.  For planned unit developments, setbacks may be modified by the planning commission to achieve better consistency with the purposes of this chapter as part of the planned unit development process to increase safety as well as protect the natural environment. 
C.  For new subdivisions, parcels shall have a minimum creek setback of fifty-five feet from the top of creek bank, but this setback may be required to be enlarged as part of the subdivision process to increase safety as well as protect the natural environment. Sensitive habitats, floodplains, and eroding creek banks should be included within the setback area. 
D.  Persons proposing development along creeks should consult Section 18.32, F-P (Floodplain) Combining District Regulations, contained in the zoning regulations as these provisions affect development in the floodplains along creeks. 
(Ord. 2007-369 § 1, 2007)  
18.59.040 - Top of creek bank. 
The "top of creek bank" is where the creek channel sides intercept adjoining higher ground. In cases where the top of creek bank is difficult to discern, the top of creek bank shall be based on a physical inspection by the town geologist or his designee in concert with the property owner. 
(Ord. 2007-369 § 1, 2007)  
18.59.050 - Ordinary high water mark (OHWM). 
The "ordinary high water mark" is a line on a creek bank that reflects the normal high water mark experienced over time. In the town, the OHWM is usually about three to four feet above the normal base water flow. The town geologist or his designee will assist a property owner in identifying the OHWM consistent with the Army Corps of Engineers standards. 
(Ord. 2007-369 § 1, 2007)  
18.59.060 - Repair and maintenance of existing structures within creek setbacks. 
Existing buildings, decks, driveways, impervious surfaces, and other structures that are within a required creek setback may be maintained and repaired as necessary to keep them useable or improve their condition or quality pursuant to any required building/site development permit. Fences are addressed in Section 18.59.090 below. 
(Ord. 2007-369 § 1, 2007)  
18.59.070 - Reconstruction and replacement of structures within creek setbacks. 
Existing buildings, decks, driveways, impervious surfaces, and other structures that are within a required creek setback may be reconstructed or replaced as provided for in items A. and B. below, provided that in no case shall such construction increase the extent of the encroachment into the setback area. The extent of encroachment takes into account both the total square footage of structures within the setback and their proximity to the creek. Since flexibility in design is desirable for property owners and provides opportunities to reduce impacts on the creek, new construction is not limited to the footprint or location of the preexisting structure but may be relocated in order to provide a design more consistent with the purposes of Section 18.59.010. Such relocations cannot, however, increase the extent of encroachment in the setback. The building permit and/or a site development permit may require measures that are reasonably related to the project in order to prevent creek bank failure and erosion and to mitigate adverse effects on the creek environment. Property owners are encouraged to decrease existing encroachments in creek setbacks when construction or replacement takes place. 
A.  Reconstruction and replacement following involuntary damage. Existing buildings, decks, driveways, impervious surfaces, and other structures that are within a required creek setback may be reconstructed or replaced when necessitated by involuntary damage. For purposes of this chapter, involuntary damage is defined as damage by fire, flood, explosion, wind, earthquake, war, riot, or wood destroying pests or other calamity or force majeure. Involuntary damage necessitating reconstruction or replacement shall be confirmed by the town. Reconstruction or replacement beyond that necessitated by involuntary damage shall be treated in accordance with subsection B. below. Fences are addressed in Section 18.59.090 below. 
B.  Reconstruction and replacement following voluntary demolition. Existing buildings, decks, driveways, impervious surfaces, and other structures that are within a required creek setback may be reconstructed or replaced following voluntary demolition when such demolition affects less than fifty percent of the floor area of a building, deck, other structure or less than fifty percent of the surface area of a driveway or other impervious surface. If voluntary demolition affects fifty percent or more of the total floor or total surface area, such replacement or reconstruction shall conform to the required creek setback unless there is no alternate site that is completely or partially outside of the required creek setback. Fences are addressed in Section 18.59.090 below. 
(Ord. 2007-369 § 1, 2007)  
18.59.080 - Creek bank stabilization projects. 
New, expanded or repaired creek bank stabilization projects are permitted within the creek setback pursuant to a building permit and/or site development permit. Such projects shall be designed to state-of-the-art practices. Designs using the most up-to-date techniques for protecting banks by employing environmentally sound solutions such as revegetation, bioengineered and biotechnical methods are encouraged. Projects shall minimize the risk of causing physical damage to upstream, downstream or opposing properties. Physical damage includes flooding, creek bank erosion, or creek bank failure. Stabilization projects are to be designed to provide long-term protection and at the same time be consistent with the purposes of Section 18.59.010. 
(Ord. 2007-369 § 1, 2007)  
18.59.090 - Fences. 
Existing fences below the top of bank may not be repaired, reconstructed or replaced other than as an approved creek bank stabilization measure as provided for in Section 18.59.080. Existing fences above the top of bank may be repaired, reconstructed or replaced when in conformance with Chapter 18.43 of the Zoning Ordinance. New fences shall conform to Chapter 18.43 of the Zoning Ordinance. (See Section 18.04.155 for definition of "fence.") 
(Ord. 2007-369 § 1, 2007)

(Ord. 1988-242 § 3 (Exh. B)(part), 1988)  
18.64.050 - Review—Guiding principles for external design. 
In carrying out the purpose of this title with respect to the external design of structures, the commission shall keep in mind the following principles: 
A.  It is not a purpose of this chapter that control of architectural character should be so rigidly enforced that individual initiative is stifled in the design of any particular structure, or substantial additional expense is required; rather, it is the intent of this chapter that any control exercised be the minimum necessary to achieve the overall objectives of this title. 
B.  Good architectural character is based upon the suitability of a structure for its purposes; upon the appropriate use of sound materials; and upon the principles of harmony and proportion in the elements of the structure. 
C.  Good architectural character is not, in itself, more expensive than poor architectural character, and is not dependent upon the particular style of architecture selected. 
D.  The relationship of a structure to its surroundings is of greater importance than the quality of design of the individual structure. 
E.  Nonresidential structures shall be compatible with the rural atmosphere of Portola Valley. Small, interesting shapes and groupings are preferred to large, simple, geometric forms of comparable size. 
F.  When deemed warranted by the staff or the ASCC, an evaluation shall be made of the compatibility of the proposed project with existing off-site conditions and with potential future off-site conditions to the extent such conditions can reasonably be anticipated. This evaluation should demonstrate compatibility of the proposed height, bulk and mass with conditions in the area, including anticipated future development of adjoining properties, even if such compatibility requires adhering to standards that are more restrictive than the maximums set forth in this title. 
(Ord. 1995-285 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1995: Ord. 1986-210 § 3, 1986: Ord. 1979-166 § 25 (part), 1979; Ord. 1967-80 § 1 (6912.7), 1967)  
18.64.060 - Review—Site development criteria. 
In addition to reviewing the proposed development in relation to specific requirements and conditions of this title, the architectural and site control commission shall consider such of the following as are applicable to the particular case. This may result in the necessity to reduce floor area, impervious surface or height and may require an increase in setbacks from property lines. 
A.  Design of the structure so as to minimize disturbance to the natural terrain; 
B.  Maximum possible preservation of existing vegetation; 
C.  Design and location of the structure in relation to provision of adequate light and air to itself and its neighbors; 
D.  Landscaping, screening, and fencing to preserve privacy and mitigate adverse effects on neighboring properties; 
E.  Location of entrances and exits and layout of internal circulation in relation to traffic safety and ease and convenience of movement; 
F.  Arrangement and intensity of night lighting in relation to public safety and effect on adjoining properties; 
G.  Planting and site design as related to problems of drainage and soil erosion; 
H.  Materials and colors shall be compatible with the rural setting of the town and the surrounding landscape and structures; 
I.  Grading so as to minimize the apparent disturbance to the natural terrain; 
J.  With respect to mobile homes certified under the National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, building design may be reviewed only in regard to roof material and color, roof overhang and siding material and color.

Because the establishment or enlargement of activities and facilities will result in other changes, including an increase in vehicular and other traffic, noise, and activities associated with traffic, the following dedications and improvements are deemed to be necessary and the architectural and site control commission may recommend that they be made and installed so as to prevent congestion and the other hazards that are related to the intensified use of the land: 
A.  All streets, both thoroughfares and locals, which are on the front, side or rear property lines of the subject property shall be dedicated to the full width required by the town on the side of the street or highway center line bordering the property. The improvements and dedications may include the following, and appurtenant easements: berms, stabilized shoulder, pedestrian paths, trails, street paving, street trees or other planting, street signs, street lights, and all required utilities, and shall conform to the standards established by the town.
