(Amd. Ord. 106-86 - 10/14/86)
6.406. The Board of Local Improvements shall make
assessment policies for the assessor to use as a guide. The
following is a list of the methods of determining assessments
listed in descending order of preference:
A. LOTS ABUTTING RESIDENTIAL STREETS:
1. The residents' share of the cost of a
specific street may be divided equally among
abutting lots on a per lot basis except for lots
that vary more than ten percent from the average
frontage of all affected lots. If a lot's frontage
varies more than ten percent from the average, the
assessment may be based on the actual percentage
of variation, or;
2. Assessments for the residents' share of
the cost of the improvement may be based on a per
foot basis, or;
3. Assessments may be based on the actual
expected increase in property value. A real estate
appraiser may be contracted for this task. A
sample of properties would be appraised prior to
improvement. Based on the sample, the appraiser
would then estimate the value of the properties
within the project area with the desired
improvements. The properties would then be
assessed based on the appraiser's estimate of
increased property value.
B. CORNER LOTS:
1. When possible, the cross street may be
improved to the rear property line of the affected
lot on the project street. The corner lot may be
assessed one-third of the cost of the side street
on a per foot basis and the remaining residents'
share of the cost of the project may then be
divided equally among all lots including the
corner lot on a per lot basis, or;
2. Assessments for the residents' share of
6-14
the cost may be made on a per foot basis, or;
3. Real estate appraisal process described
above under 6.406 (A) (3) may be used to determine
assessment, or;
4. Assess the greater of the two sides and
divide the remainder of the residents' share of
the costs equally among all lots including the
corner lot on a per lot or per foot basis.
C. COLLECTORS AND ARTERIALS:
1. The lots having addresses on the collector

ARTICLE VI. POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
7.601 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex.
The courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form of
discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an
environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is
unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the Village to
prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official,
municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office
on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal
agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are
prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.
7.602 DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated
in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual
harassment as:
Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or
7-8
any conduct of a sexual nature when:
1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment,
2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual
is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such
individual, or
3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating
an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
? Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults,
humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific
traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for
dates, or statements about other employees, even outside of
their presence, of a sexual nature.
? Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling),
leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily
gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking” or “kissing” noises.
? Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual
nature, viewing pornographic material or websites.
? Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
? Textual/Electronic: “sexting” (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures and video),
the use of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber
stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages,
intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and
social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier
to determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual
harassment is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on
individual perception and interpretation. The courts will assess
sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
“reasonable person.”
7.603 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL
HARASSMENT.
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal
with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by
clearly communicating her/his position to the offending employee,
and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary for sexual
harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
7-9
? Electronic/Direct Communication. If there is sexual
harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee
should directly and clearly express her/his objection that
the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending
behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If
subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in
writing in a note or a memo.
? Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee
feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate
supervisor of the person making the report, a department
head, a director of human resources, an ethics officer, the
city manager or administrator, or the chief executive
officer of the municipality.
The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be
sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware
of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim
fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer,
the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
? Resolution Outside Municipality. The purpose of this policy
is to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures
for responding to every report and incident so that problems
can be identified and remedied by the municipality. However,
all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information
regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An
IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint
with the EEOC must also be filed within 300 days.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report
(what was said or done, the date, the time and the place),
including, but not limited to, written records such as letters,
notes, memos and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted
and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the
attention of the municipality. However, because of the serious
implications of sexual harassment charges and the difficulties
associated with their investigation and the questions of
credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate
7-10
outcome. (Amd. 1/22/2019 Ord 04-19)
7.604 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL
HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.
No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action
against any municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
1. Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy,
2. The provision of information related to or testimony before
any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or
inquiry into any violation of this policy, or
3. Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion
or transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment
of any municipal employee that is taken in retaliation for a
municipal employee’s involvement in protected activity pursuant
to this policy.
No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if
a report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition,
any witness will be protected from retaliation.
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein,
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10)
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of
promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee
who does any of the following:
1. Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a
public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer,
member, State agency, or other State employee that the State
employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule,
or regulation,
2. Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any
violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer,
member, State agency or other State employee, or
3. Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an
employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses
information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a
legislative commission or committee, or in any other proceeding,
7-11
where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or federal law,
rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate
against an employee for disclosing information to a government or
law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause
to believe that the information discloses a violation of a State
or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it
is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more
people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she
has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good faith
believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she
has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under
the Illinois Human Rights Act.
An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or
EEOC, may file a retaliation charge – either due within 300 days
of the alleged retaliation. (Amd. 1/22/2019 Ord 04-19)
7.605 CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be
applicable pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements,
procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining
agreement, any person who violates this policy or the Prohibition
on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and
penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State law or
Federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense.
Any discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and
distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any
fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a State or
Federal agency.
7.606 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an
accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end
other than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for
reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report made
in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of
the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action.
Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of this policy shall be subject to
discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks
and/or collective bargaining agreements.
7-12
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and
Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector
general, the State Police, a State’s Attorney, the Attorney
General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty of a
Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who
intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the
USEPA, provided that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver,
or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and
provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
8.1408. SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
A. Suspension due to Illicit Discharges in
Emergency Situations - The Village may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when
such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or
Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
The Village may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.
B. Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit
Discharge - Any person discharging to the MS4 in
violation of this ordinance may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The Village will notify a violator
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The
violator may petition The Village for a reconsideration
and hearing.
C. A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant
to this Section, without the prior approval The
Village.
8.1409. INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of

in a form acceptable to The Village prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.
8-26
8.1410. MONITORING OF DISCHARGES
A. Applicability.
This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial
activity, including construction activity.
B. Access to Facilities.
1. The Village shall be permitted to
enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this ordinance as often as
may be necessary to determine compliance with
this ordinance. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry
into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of The Village.
2. Facility operators shall allow The
Village ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records
that must be kept under the conditions of an
NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the
performance of any additional duties as
defined by state and federal law.
3. The Village shall have the right to
set up on any permitted facility such devices
as are necessary in the opinion of The
Village to conduct monitoring and/or sampling
of the facility's stormwater discharge.
4. The Village has the right to
require the discharger to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its
own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
5. Any temporary or permanent
obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall
be promptly removed by the operator at the
written or oral request of The Village and
8-27
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the operator.
6. Unreasonable delays in allowing The
Village access to a permitted facility is a
violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this ordinance. A person who is the
operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater associated with
industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies The Village reasonable access
to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or
required by this ordinance.
7. If The Village has been refused
access to any part of the premises from which
stormwater is discharged, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this ordinance,
or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program designed to verify
compliance with this ordinance or any order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then The Village may seek issuance
of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.
8.1411. REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE
STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT
PRACTICES (BMP).
The Village will adopt requirements identifying BMPs for any
activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system,
or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural
BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property
or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit
discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm
sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid
NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs
8-28
shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
8.1412. WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes,
or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the
watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate,
or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse.
In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately
owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such
structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
8.1413. NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation has information of
any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or
may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into
stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S., said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately
notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency
dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous
materials, said person shall notify The Village in person or by
phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to The Village within three (3)
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited
materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at
least three (3) years.
8.1414. ENFORCEMENT.
Notice of Violation.
A. Whenever The Village finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this ordinance, The
Village may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:

B. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of
affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a
deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be
completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the
violator fail to remediate or restore within the established
deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental
agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to
the violator.
8.1415. APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
Any person receiving a Notice of Violation may appeal the
determination of violation to the Village Administrator within
seven (7) days of the notice of violation. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Village Administrator shall schedule, as soon as
practicable, a meeting in an attempt to resolve any pending issue
with the appellant. The Village Administrator may include in that
meeting, in his discretion, the Superintendent of Public Works,
the Village engineer, the Village Attorney, or any other
individual or consultant which, in the opinion of the Village
Administrator, would facilitate resolution of the pending issue.
8.1416. ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL.
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the
requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, or, in the
event of an appeal, within seven (7) days of the decision of the
municipal authority upholding the decision of The Village, then
representatives of The Village shall enter upon the subject

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
8 ½.101. INTERPRETATION.
A. The provisions of this chapter shall be held
to be minimum requirements, adopted to lessen the threat
to public health, safety, or welfare through protection
of soil erosion and sediment control sought by the
enactment of this ordinance.
B. Excessive quantities of soil may erode from
areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural
uses including but not limited to the
construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and
industrial plants, the building of roads and highways,
the modification of stream channels and drainage ways,
and the creation of recreational facilities;
C. The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded
soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and
safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision and
reducing traction of road vehicles;
D. Soil erosion necessitates the costly
repairing of gullies, washed-out fills, and embankments;
E. Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog
sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers,
streams, lakes, wetlands, and reservoirs;
F. Sediment limits the use of water and
waterways for most beneficial purposes, destroys fish
and other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and
difficult to remove; and
G. Sediment reduces the channel capacity of
waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and
natural depressions, resulting in increased chances of
flooding at risk to public health and safety.
8 ½.102. PURPOSE.
The Village of Machesney Park therefore declares that the
purpose of this ordinance is to safeguard persons, protect
property, prevent damage to the environment, and promote the
8½-2
public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the
design, construction, use and maintenance of any development
or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or
otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated
in The Village of Machesney Park. It is the intention of this
ordinance that the transport of sediment via wind or
rainwater runoff from sites affected by land disturbing
activities be limited, as closely as practicable, to that
which would have occurred if the land had been left in its
undisturbed state.
The management practices, controls, and other provisions
contained in an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan must be at
least as protective as the requirements contained in the
Illinois Urban Manual-A Technical Manual for Urban Ecosystem
Protection Enhancement, 2002, prepared by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service.

8 ½.202. GENERAL PRINCIPLES.
It is the objective of this ordinance to control soil erosion
and sedimentation caused by development activities, including
clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, and filling of land,
in The Village. Measures taken to control soil erosion and
offsite sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that
sediment is not transported from the site by wind erosion or a
storm event of ten-year frequency or less. The following
principles shall apply to all development activities within The
Village and to the preparation of the submissions required under
this ordinance:
8½-5
A. Development should be related to the
topography and soils of the site so as to create the
least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes
where high cuts and fills may be required should be
avoided wherever possible, and existing contours
should be followed as closely as possible.
B. Natural vegetation should be retained and
protected wherever possible. Areas immediately
adjacent to existing watercourses, lakes, ponds, and
wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible.
Temporary crossings of watercourses, when permitted,
must include appropriate stabilization measures.
C. Special precautions should be taken to
prevent damages that occur due to any necessary
development activity within or adjacent to any stream,
lake, pond, or wetland. Preventative measures must be
commensurate with the sensitivity of these areas to
erosion and sedimentation.
D. The smallest practical area of disturbance
should be exposed for the shortest practical time
during development.
E. Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers,
diversions, and any other appropriated sediment or
runoff control measures should be installed prior to
site clearing and grading and maintained to control
and remove sediment from run-off waters from land
undergoing development.
F. The selection of erosion and sedimentation
control measures should be based on site limitations,
project duration, and other factors to provide the
necessary site protection during the construction
development activity.
G. In the design of erosion control facilities
and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of
continuing maintenance shall be considered.
H. Permanent vegetation and runoff control
structures shall be installed and functional as soon
as practical during development.
8½-6
I. All waste generated as a result of site
development activity shall be properly disposed of and
should be prevented from being carried off the site by
either wind, water, or artificial means.
J. All construction sites shall provide
measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto
public or private roadways.
8 ½.203. APPLICABILITY.
Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, no person shall
commence or perform any land disturbing activity including but not
limited to clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, or filling of
land that will disturb an area greater than or equal to 100 square
feet or more without having first obtained approval for a site
Erosion and Sediment Control Permit from The Village.
Other Village permits involving the disturbance of soil of any
kind or which may potentially lead to ground erosion or sediment
migration shall include a certification statement to ensure that
Best Management Practices are employed during site construction.
8 ½.204. DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
The Superintendent of Public Works shall be able to delegate
powers and authority to other representatives of The Village.
Designated representatives may include but are not limited to The
Village Engineer, Public Works Technicians, and third party
engineering consulting firms acting on The Village’s behalf. All
references in this chapter to ‘The Superintendent of Public Works’
shall also mean their designated representatives.

8 ½.305. WAIVER OF PERMIT FEES.
The Superintendent of Public Works shall have the authority to
waive permit fees for work to be completed by Public Utilities.
This exemption shall not waive any other requirements related to
erosion and sediment control and as such, an Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan will still be required prior to the
commencement of work.
8 ½.306. REVIEW AND APPROVAL.
Each erosion and sediment control plan shall be reviewed and acted
upon according to the following procedures:
Superintendent of Public Works will review each plan and
determine its conformance with the provisions of this
ordinance. Within fourteen (14) days after receiving the
plan, the designee shall in writing:
A. Approve the erosion and sediment control plan
8½-12
if it is found to be in conformance with the provisions
of this ordinance and issue an Erosion and Sediment
Control Permit;
B. Approve the erosion and sediment control plan
subject to such reasonable conditions as may be
necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this
ordinance and issue an Erosion and Sediment Control
Permit; or
C. Disapprove the erosion and sediment control
plan, indicating the deficiencies and the procedure for
submitting a revised erosion and sediment control plan.
8 ½.307. CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL.
Approval shall not be issued for an intended development site
unless:
A. The development, including but not limited to
subdivisions and planned unit development, has been
approved by The Village where applicable, and
B. All relevant federal and state permits (i.e.,
for floodplains and wetlands) have been received for the
portion of the site subject to soil disturbance.
Some methods, practices and engineered products used for erosion
and sediment control may not be allowed by The Superintendent of
Public Works and as such, some Erosion and Sediment Control Plans
may need changes or modifications to provide adequate erosion and
sediment protection and satisfy the requirements of The
Superintendent of Public Works.
8 ½.308. APPEALS
The applicant, or any person or agency that received notice of the
filing of the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan or the Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan may appeal an enforcement decision of
The Superintendent of Public Works as provided in Sec. 404
hereunder. The appeal may be filed to the Village Administrator
and upon receipt of the appeal the Village Administrator shall
schedule as soon as practicable a meeting in an attempt to resolve
any pending issue with the appellant. The Village Administrator
may include in that meeting, in his discretion, the Superintendent
of Public Works, the Village Engineer, the Village Attorney, or
any other individual or consultant which, in the opinion of the
8½-13
Village Administrator, would facilitate resolution of the pending
issue. Factors to be considered on review shall include, but
need not be limited to, the effects of the proposed development
activities on the surface water flow to tributary and downstream
lands, any comprehensive watershed management plans, or the use of
any retention facilities; possible saturation of fill and
unsupported cuts by water, both natural and domestic; runoff
surface waters that produce erosion and silting of drainage ways;
nature and type of soil or rock, which when disturbed by the
proposed development activities may create earth movement and
produce slopes that cannot be landscaped; and excessive and
unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape through grading or
removal or vegetation.
8 ½.309. PERMIT EXPIRATION.
The permit expiration period shall be determined by the estimated
project schedule provided by the permittee in the Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan.
Permits shall be valid starting the date they are approved and
shall naturally expire following the term indicated on the permit.
If a permit expires prior to the completion and final
stabilization of a project, all work on site must cease and the
site must be stabilized immediately until a new Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan is submitted and approved for a new permit.
No permit shall be issued with an expiration period extending
beyond 12 months. Should a project require a completion schedule
of longer than 12 months, a new Erosion and Sediment Control Plan
must be submitted and approved prior to the expiration of the
original permit to extend permit coverage to the continuing
construction activities.
ARTICLE IV. SITE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
8 ½.401. SITE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
On-site sediment control measures, as specified by the following
criteria, shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating
clearing, grading, stripping, excavation, or fill activities on
the site. The management practices, controls, and other provisions
contained in the erosion and sediment control plan must be at
least as protective as the requirements contained in the Illinois
Urban Manual.
A. Land disturbance activities in stream
8½-14
channels shall be avoided, where possible. If
disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following
requirements shall be met:
1. Construction vehicles shall be kept out
of the stream channel to the maximum extent
practicable. Where construction crossings are
necessary, temporary crossings shall be constructed
of non-erosive material, such as riprap or gravel.
2. The time and area of disturbance of
stream channels shall be kept to a minimum. The
stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be
re-stabilized within 48 hours after channel
disturbance is completed, interrupted, or stopped.
3. Whenever channel relocation is
necessary, the new channel shall be constructed in
the dry and fully stabilized before flow is
diverted.
B. Sediment traps or anchored filter barriers
meeting accepted design standards and specifications
outlined in the Illinois Urban Manual shall protect
storm sewer inlets and culverts.
C. Soil storage piles containing more than 10
cubic yards of material shall not be located with a
downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a
roadway or drainage channel. Filter barriers, including
straw bales, filter fence, or equivalent, shall be
installed immediately on the downslope side of the
piles.
D. If dewatering devices are used, discharge
locations shall be protected from erosion. All pumped
discharges shall be routed through appropriately
designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent.
E. Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent)
entrance roads, access drives, and parking areas a
minimum of fifty feet long and 12 feet wide to prevent
sediment from being tracked onto public or private
roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road
shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not
flushing) before the end of each workday and transported
to a controlled sediment disposal area.
8½-15
F. All temporary and permanent erosion and
sediment control practices must be maintained and
repaired as needed to assure effective performance of
their intended function.
G. All temporary erosion and sediment control
measures shall be disposed of within 30 days after final
site stabilization is achieved with permanent soil
stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of
temporary measures should be permanently stabilized to
prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
8 ½.402. INSPECTION.
The Superintendent of Public Works shall make inspections as
hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the
work completed or shall notify the applicant wherein the work
fails to comply with the erosion and sedimentation control plans
as approved. In order to obtain inspections and to ensure
compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan and
this ordinance, the applicant shall notify the inspector within
two (2) working days of the completion of the construction stages
specified below:
A. Upon completion of installation of sediment
and runoff control measures (including perimeter
controls and diversions), prior to proceeding with any
other earth disturbance or grading,
B. After stripping and clearing,
C. After seeding and landscaping deadlines, and
D. After final stabilization and landscaping,
prior to removal of sediment controls.
If stripping, clearing, grading and /or landscaping are to be done
in phases or areas, the applicant shall give notice and request
inspection at the completion of each of the above work states in
each phase or area.
The Village shall also reserve the right to inspect disturbed
areas of the construction site that have not been finally
stabilized, structural control measures, and locations where
vehicles enter or exit the site at least once every seven (7)
8½-16
calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm that is
0.5 inches or greater or equivalent snowfall.
The site owner and/or contractor shall provide inspections of the
site in a format of their own choosing conforming to the
inspection requirements of NPDES Permit No. ILR10. The records of
these inspections shall be submitted to The Village each week on
Mondays by 4:30 p.m. In the case where Monday is a Village
observed legal holiday, the report shall be submitted by 4:30 p.m.
the first business day following Monday. Owner/contractor
inspections will be required at least once every seven (7)
calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm that is
0.5 inches or greater or equivalent snowfall following Village
approval of the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and shall
continue to be completed and submitted to The Village until final
stabilization and landscaping is completed. These requirements
shall not relieve the site owner or contractor of any additional
reporting requirements associated with NPDES Permit No. ILR10.
Inspections shall be submitted electronically to the Village at
the email address specified at the time the permit is issued. The
Superintendent of Public Works may allow hard copies of
inspections to be submitted in lieu of or in addition to
electronic copies should hard copies be preferable to The Village
for a specific project.
If at any stage of the grading of any development site The
Superintendent of Public Works determines by inspection that the
nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an
existing building permit is likely to imperil any property, public
way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, The
Superintendent of Public Works may require, as a condition of
allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable special
precautions to be taken as is considered advisable to avoid the
likelihood of such peril. “Special precautions” may include, but
shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction
of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction or
cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and
recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or engineering
geologist which may be made requirements for further work.
Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading
on any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and
the applicant may be required to install temporary structures of
take such other measures to protect adjoining property or the
public safety.
8½-17
Major amendments of the erosion and sediment control plan shall be
submitted to The Village and shall be processed and approved or
disapproved in the same manner as the original plans. The Village
may authorize field modifications of a minor nature by written
authorization to the applicant.
8 ½.403. RETENTION OF PLANS.
The applicant shall retain copies of plans and all reports for a
period of at least three (3) years from the date the site is
finally stabilized. The applicant shall also retain a copy of the
plan at the construction site from the date of project initiation
to the date of final stabilization.
The Village shall retain plans, specifications, and reports for
all site developments in original form.
8 ½.404. ENFORCEMENT.
A. Written Warning; In the event The
Superintendent of Public Works determines any person
holding an approved erosion and sediment control plan
pursuant to this ordinance violates the terms of the
approval and The Superintendent of Public Works
determines that the violation poses a ‘low threat’ to
causing soil erosion or storm water pollution, a warning
notice shall be issued. Following the issuance of a
warning notice, the permittee shall remediate the
violation as soon as possible and in all cases within
three days of the issuance of the warning notice. A ‘low
threat’ violation shall be defined as any condition
which is not in compliance with the approved Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan and is determined by The
Superintendent of Public Works to be unlikely to cause
immediate erosion of soil, environmental hazard, or
migration of material off-site.
B. Fines levied via Municipal Administrative
Hearing Process; In the event The Superintendent of
Public Works determines any person holding an approved
erosion and sediment control plan pursuant to this
ordinance violates the terms of the approval and The
Superintendent of Public Works determines that the
violation poses a ‘high threat’ to causing soil erosion
or storm water pollution, a fine shall be levied against
the permittee in the amount of $750 per violation per
day that the violation remains until remediated and re8
½-18
inspected by The Superintendent of Public Works. A ‘high
threat’ violation shall be defined as any condition
which is not in compliance with the approved Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan and is determined by The
Superintendent of Public Works to be likely to cause
immediate erosion of soil, environmental hazard, or
migration of material off-site.
Any ‘high threat’ violation will be reported by The

for not more than seven (7) days, giving the licensee an
opportunity to be heard during that period, except that if

B. “Department” means the Illinois Department of Revenue.
C. “Gross charge” means the amount paid for the act or

is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and
when paid. “Gross charges” for private line service shall
include charges imposed at each channel termination point within
the Village and charges for that portion of the inter-office
channels provided within the Village. Charges for that portion
of the inter-office channel connecting 2 or more channel
termination points, one or more of which is located within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, shall be determined by
the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge
for the inter-office channel by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of channel termination points that are
located within the jurisdictional boundary of the Village and
the denominator of which is the total number of channel
termination points connected by the inter-office channel.
However, “gross charge” shall not include any of the following:
1. Any amounts added to a purchaser’s bill because of
a charge made pursuant to: (i) the tax imposed by
this Ordinance, (ii) the tax imposed by the
Telecommunications Excise Tax Act, (iii) the tax
imposed by Section 4251 of the Internal Revenue
Code, (iv) 911 surcharges, or (v) charges added to
customers’ bills pursuant to the provisions of

tax liabilities or other amounts specified in those
provisions of the Public Utilities Act.
2. Charges for a sent collect telecommunication
received outside of the Village.
3. Charges for leased time on equipment or charges
for the storage of data or information for subsequent
retrieval or the processing of data or information intended
to change its form or content. Such equipment includes,
but is not limited to, the use of calculators, computers,
data processing equipment, tabulating equipment or
accounting equipment and also includes the usage of

source, wherein such charges are disaggregated and
separately identified from other charges.

the extent of such exemption and during the period of time
specified by the Department of Commerce and Economic

and equipment provided in connection therewith between a
parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or
between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed
under this Ordinance has already been paid to a retailer

corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly
owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the
corporation rendering such service.
7. Bad debts (“bad debt” means any portion of a debt
that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges
are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become
worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable
federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt
19½-3
deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall
report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting
period in which the payment is made).
8. Charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated
telecommunication devices.
9. Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers
under the Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance Fee
Act.
10. Charges for nontaxable services or
telecommunications if (i) those charges are aggregated with
other charges for telecommunications that are taxable, (ii)
those charges are not separately stated on the customer
bill or invoice, and (iii) the retailer can reasonably
identify the nontaxable charges on the retailer’s books and
records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the
gross charge from the sale of both taxable and nontaxable
services or telecommunications billed on a combined basis
shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable
charges shall be on the retailer of the telecommunications.

the State of Illinois.
E. “Intrastate telecommunications” means all
telecommunications that originate and terminate within the State

State, who, to the satisfaction of the Department, furnishes
adequate security to insure collection and payment of the tax.
Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to
collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of
such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges
for telecommunications in this State in the same manner and
subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a
place of business within this State. The permit may be revoked
by the Department at its discretion.
I. “Retailer maintaining a place of business in this
State”, or any like term, means and includes any retailer having
or maintaining within the State of Illinois, directly or by a
subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission
facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business,
or any agent or other representative operating within the State
of Illinois under the authority of the retailer or its
subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or
agent or other representative is located here permanently or
temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed
to do business in the State of Illinois.
J. “Sale at retail” means the transmitting, supplying or
furnishing of telecommunications and all services and equipment
provided in connection therewith for a consideration, to persons
other than the Federal and State governments, and State
universities created by statute and other than between a parent

owned subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for
resale.
K. “Service address” means the location of
telecommunications equipment from which telecommunications
services are originated or at which telecommunications services
are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a
defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging
systems, and maritime systems, service address means the
customer’s place of primary use as defined in the Mobile
Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground
systems and the like, “service address” shall mean the location
of a taxpayer’s primary use of the telecommunications equipment
as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location
in Illinois where bills are sent.
19½-5
L. “Taxpayer” means a person who individually or through
his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act
or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in a
municipality and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by the
Ordinance.
M. “Telecommunications”, in addition to the meaning
ordinarily and popularly ascribed to it, includes, without
limitation, messages or information transmitted through use of
local, toll, and wide area telephone service, private line
services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,
computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications
service, specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio,
paging service, or any other form of mobile and portable one-way
or two-way communications, or any other transmission of messages
or information by electronic or similar means, between or among
points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this Ordinance,
“private line” means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service
for a single customer that entitles the customer to exclusive or
priority use of a communications channel or group of channels,
from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of “telecommunications”
shall not include value added services in which computer
processing applications are used to act on the form, content,
code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than
transmission. “Telecommunications” shall not include purchases
of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provided
for use as a component part of the service provided by such
provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or
terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier
access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in
the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or
integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be
non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling
arrangements shall not be considered “telecommunications’
subject to the tax imposed under this Ordinance. For purposes
of this Section, “prepaid telephone calling arrangements” means
that term as defined in Section 2-27 of the Retailers’
Occupation Tax Act.

A. The tax authorized by this Ordinance shall be

the Department. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or
as authorized by this Ordinance and any such tax collected by

shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the State.
Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the
tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating
or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this
Ordinance shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the
retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in
the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail.
If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then
the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.

Telecommunications Tax Act (35 ILCS 636/5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the Department to

19 ½.105. Resellers.
A. If a person who originates or receives
telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such
telecommunications, such person shall apply to the Department
for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which
will show the Department why such applicant is not liable for
the tax authorized by this Chapter on any of such purchases and
shall furnish such additional information as the Department may
reasonably require.
19½-8
B. Upon approval of the application, the Department shall
assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such
number to the applicant. The Department may cancel any number
which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to
send or receive such telecommunications tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies
because of the person’s having discontinued the making of
resales.
C. Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the
act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications
in this State shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being
a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number
from the Department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.
19 ½.106. Rebates and Exemptions.
A. To the extent that the Village’s territory includes
part of another unit of local government or a school district,
the Village may, by separate ordinance, rebate some or all of

other unit of local government or school district qualifying for
the rebate as determined by the Village’s ordinance, which shall
not be filed with the Department.
B. The Village may, by separate ordinance, rebate some or
all of the amount of the tax authorized by this Ordinance paid
by persons 65 years of age or older. Any tax related to such
rebate shall be rebated from the Village directly to persons
qualified for the rebate as determined by the Village’s
ordinance, which shall not be filed with the Department.
19 ½.107. Severability.
If any provision of this Ordinance, or the application of
any provision of this Ordinance, is held unconstitutional or
otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall not affect other
provisions of this Ordinance, or their application, that can be
given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision
or its application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision,
or application of such provision, is severable, unless otherwise
provided by this Ordinance.
19½-9
19 ½.108. Effective Date.
This Ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and
after its passage and approval and publication as required by
law; provided, however, that the tax provided for herein shall
take effect for all bills issued on or after the first day of
July 2008. Copies of this Ordinance shall be certified and sent

CHAPTER 23. FLOOD AREA DEVELOPMENT
ARTICLE I. REGULATIONS
23.101 Purpose.
This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to
this Village by the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-
12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8 and 5/11-31-2) in order to accomplish the
following purposes:
A. To prevent unwise developments from increasing flood or
drainage hazards to others;
B. protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
C. to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens from the hazards of flooding;
D. to lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control,
repairs to public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue
and relief operations;
E. maintain property values and a stable tax base by minimizing
the potential for creating blight areas;
F. make federally subsidized flood insurance available, and
G. to preserve the natural characteristics and functions of
watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and
storm water impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide
recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and
enhance community and economic development.
23.102 Definitions.
For the purposes of this ordinance, the following definitions are
adopted:
Base Flood- The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known
as the 100-year flood. The base flood elevation at any location is as
defined in Section 3 of this ordinance.
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) - The elevation in relation to mean sea
level of the crest of the base flood.
Basement- That portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below
23-2
ground level) on all sides.
Building- A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground including manufactured
homes, prefabricated buildings and gas or liquid storage tanks. The
term also includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers installed
on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days per year.
Compensatory Storage- An artificially excavated, hydraulically
equivalent volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of
natural flood storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are
placed within the floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural
floodplain storage can increase off-site floodwater elevations and
flows.
Critical Facility- Any facility which is critical to the health and
welfare of the population and, if flooded, would create an added
dimension to the disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can
impact the delivery of vital services, can cause greater damage to
other sectors of the community, or can put special populations at
risk.
Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be
required include: emergency services facilities (such as fire and
police stations), schools, hospitals retirement homes and senior care
facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers, and hazardous material
storage facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic
substances).
Development- Any man-made change to real estate including, but not
necessarily limited to:
1. Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair,
placement of a building, or any structural alteration to
a building;
2. substantial improvement of an existing building;
3. installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing
a site for a manufactured home, or installing a travel
trailer on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180)
days per year;
4. installation of utilities, construction of roads,
bridges, culverts or similar projects;
5. construction or erection of levees, dams walls or fences;
23-3
6. drilling, mining, filling, dredging, grading, excavating,
paving, or other alterations of the ground surface;
7. storage of materials including the placement of gas and
liquid storage tanks, and channel modifications or any
other activity that might change the direction, height,
or velocity of flood or surface waters.
“Development” does not include routine maintenance of existing
buildings and facilities, resurfacing roads, or gardening, plowing,
and similar practices that do not involve filing, grading, or
construction of levees.
Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision- A manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
or buildings to be constructed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either
final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community.
Expansion to an Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision- The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets,
and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

to provide a factor of safety for uncertainties in calculations,
future watershed development, unknown localized conditions, wave
actions and unpredictable effects such as those caused by ice or
debris jams.
Historic Structure- Any structure that is:
1. Listed individually in the National Register of
Historic Places or preliminarily determined by the

Department may grant approval for specific types of activities by
issuance of a statewide permit which meets the standards defined in
Section 6 of this ordinance.
Lowest Floor- the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other
than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor.
Provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the
structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design
requirements of Section 7 of this ordinance.
Manufactured Home- A structure transportable in one or more sections
that is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with
or without a permanent foundation when connected to required
utilities.
Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision- A parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land divided into two or more lots for rent or sale.
New Construction- Structures for which the start of construction
commenced or after the effective date of floodplain management
regulations adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements of such structures.
New Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision- A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed or buildings to
be constructed (including, at a minimum, the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading
or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the
effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a
community.

NFIP- National Flood Insurance Program.
Recreational Vehicle or Travel Trailer- A vehicle which is:
1. built on a single chassis;
2. four hundred (400) square feet or less in size;
3. designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck and designed primarily not for use as a
permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for
recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
Repetitive Loss- Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten year period for which the cost of
repairs at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or
exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
SFHA- See definition of floodplain.
Start of Construction- Includes substantial improvement and means the
date the building permit was issued. This, provided the actual start
of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
placement or other improvement, was within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as
the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation or
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a substantial
improvement, actual start of construction means the first alteration
of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
building.
Structure (see “Building”)
Substantial Damage- Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cumulative percentage of damage during a ten (10) year
period equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred regardless of actual repair
work performed. Volunteer labor and materials must be included in
this determination. The term includes “Repetitive Loss Buildings”
(see definition).
Substantial Improvement- Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a structure taking place during a ten (10) year
period in which the cumulative percentage of improvements:
Equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of
the structure before the improvement or repair is started, or
23-7
Increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
“Substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure. This term includes structures
which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless
of the actual repair work done.
The term does not include:
1. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply
with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions, or
1. any alteration of a structure listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of
Historic Places.
Violation- The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management
regulations. A structure or other development without the required
federal, state, and/or local permits and elevation certification is
presumed to be in violation until such time as the documentation is
provided.

maps, copies of state and federal permits, and documentation
of compliance for development activities subject to this
ordinance;
M. perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this
ordinance and make substantial damage determinations for
structures within the floodplain, and
N. maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying
IDNR/OWR and/or submitting information to FEMA within six
months whenever a modification of the floodplain may change
the base flood elevation or result in a change to the
floodplain map.
23.105. Development Permit.
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law
shall commence any development in the floodplain without first
obtaining a development permit from the Planning and Zoning
Coordinator. The Planning and Zoning Coordinator shall not issue a

contractor may also meet this requirement.
23-10
B. Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the
Planning and Zoning Coordinator shall compare the elevation of
the site to the base flood elevation. Any development located
on land that is shown by survey elevation to be below the
current base flood elevation is subject to the provisions of
this ordinance. In addition, any development located on land
shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected to a flood source, but not identified as floodplain
on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map, is subject to the
provisions of this ordinance. Any development located on land
that can be shown by survey data to be higher than the current
base flood elevation and which has not been filled after the
date of the site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map is not in
the floodplain and therefore not subject to the provisions of
this ordinance.
The Planning and Zoning Coordinator shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site’s first Flood Insurance
Rate Map identification.
The Planning and Zoning Coordinator shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal,
state, and local permits, approvals or permit-not-required
letters that may be required for this type of activity. The
Planning and Zoning Coordinator shall not issue a permit
unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been
obtained.

protection, rescue or relief operations, policing, or
repairs to roads, utilities, or other public
facilities.
6. The applicant’s circumstances are unique and do not
establish a pattern inconsistent with the intent of
the NFIP, and
7. all other state and federal permits have been
obtained.
B. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall notify an applicant
in writing that a variance from the requirements of the
building protections standards of Section 107 that would
lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
1. Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance
up to twenty-five dollars ($25) per one hundred dollars
($100) of insurance coverage;
2. increase the risk to life and property, and
3. require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of
these risks and that the applicant acknowledge in
writing the assumption of the risk and liability.
23-29
C. Historic Structures
a. Variances to the building protection requirements of
Section 107 of this ordinance which are requested in
connection with reconstruction, repair, or alteration of
a historic site or historic structure as defined in
“Historic Structures”, may be granted using criteria more
permissive than the requirements of Sections 106 and 107
of this ordinance subject to the conditions that:
1. The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
2. The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the
structure being removed as a certified historic
structure.
D. Agriculture
Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be
decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the
building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet
the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions
set forth in this ordinance.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and
the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions
shall be included for any variance issued for agricultural
structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.
1. All agricultural structures considered for a
variance from the floodplain management regulations of this
ordinance shall demonstrate that the varied structure is located
in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area
exists for the agricultural structure. Residential
structures or animal confinement facilities, such as farm
houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
2. Use of the varied structures must be limited
to agricultural purposes in zone A only as identified on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
3. For any new or substantially damaged agricultural
structures, the exterior and interior building components
and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and
interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with Section 107 of this ordinance.
4. The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structures in accordance with Section 7 of this ordinance.
All of the building's structural components must be capable
of resisting specific flood-related forces including
hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact
forces.
23-30
5. Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must
be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so
that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood
conditions in accordance with Section 107 of this ordinance.
6. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls,
subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in
accordance with Section 107(B) this ordinance.
7. The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of Section 6 of this
ordinance. No variances may be issued for agricultural
structures within any designated floodway.
8. Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed
and approved by the floodplain administrator and a
registered professional engineer or architect prior to the
issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction.
23.112. Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of protection required by this ordinance is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available
information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study.
Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made
or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that development
either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free from flooding
or damage. This ordinance does not create liability on the part of
the Village of Machesney Park or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this ordinance
or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
23.113. Penalty.
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or
failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall
be deemed to be a violation of this ordinance. Upon due
investigation, the Planning and Zoning Coordinator may determine that
a violation of the minimum standards of this ordinance exists. The
Planning and Zoning Coordinator shall notify the owner in writing of
such violation.
A. If such owner fails after ten (10) days notice to correct the
violation:
1. The Village of Machesney Park shall make application to
the circuit court for an injunction requiring
conformance with this ordinance or make such other
order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance
with the ordinance.

conviction thereof be fined not less than fifty dollars
($50) or more than seven hundred fifty ($750) for each
offense.
3. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues,
and
4. the Village of Machesney Park shall record a notice of
violation on the title of the property.
B. The Planning and Zoning Coordinator shall inform the owner
that any such violation is considered a willful act to
increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a
Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
The Village Attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring
the suspension of the subject development. The stop-work
order shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the
issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve
the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stopwork
order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Written notice of such hearing shall be served on
the permittee and shall state:
1.The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation, and
2.the time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine
whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
C. Nothing herein shall prevent the Village of Machesney Park
from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any
violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the
person or persons responsible.
23.114. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
This ordinance repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the
Village of Machesney Park to fulfill the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program including Ordinances 56-93 and 35-06.

CHAPTER 23½. STORM WATER DETENTION
ARTICLE I. REGULATIONS.
INTRODUCTION. Due to the fact that property
development increases flooding, accelerated runoff, and
decreased exposure of permeable soil surface; and the
regulation of storm water detention combined with flood
plain restrictions and/or subdivision regulations in a
unified system of regulation facilitates compliance,
efficient administration, and protection of persons and
property; and storm water detention facilities are an
acceptable method of detaining storm water runoff for new
property development, the following regulations have been
deemed necessary:
23½.101. Developments which increase the amount of
impermeable area, such as the construction of roof
structures, paved areas, or compacted areas, shall be
subject to the terms of this Chapter.
A. The following, however, shall not be included:
1. Traditional agricultural uses;
2. Modification of single-family dwellings
will continue to be used as single-family
dwellings;
3. Improvement of existing roadways which
does not increase the number of traffic lanes in
the typical cross-section of the roadway;
B. The maximum controlled storm water runoff
release rate shall not exceed the natural safe storm
water drainage capacity of the downstream system,
which has been found to be 1/2 cubic feet per second
per acre in the Village. Pipe outlets of less than
twelve inches in diameter shall not be allowed.
Multiple outlets from a storm water storage area shall
be avoided if they are designed to be less than 12
inches in diameter. Removable orifice plates shall be
employed when these pipe size requirements cannot be
met.
23½-2
C. When the maximum controlled storm water runoff
release rate shall be exceeded, any or all of the
following storm water storage methods shall be
provided and constructed:
1. DRY BOTTOM STORM WATER STORAGE.
a. Dry bottom storm water storage areas
must be designed to serve a secondary
purpose for recreation, open space, or
similar type of use, which will not be
adversely affected by occasional
intermittent flooding.
b. The combination of storage of major
flood water runoff from a 100-year return
frequency storm and the allowable release
rate shall not result in a storage duration
in excess of 48 hours.
c. Minimum grades for turf areas shall
be ½ percent (200 units horizontal to one
vertical) and maximum side slopes shall be
25 percent (four units horizontal to one
unit vertical). Storage area side slopes
shall follow the natural land contours as
closely as practicable, and a minimum of
earth excavation shall be used to create the
storage facility.
d. Temporary seeding or other soil
stabilization measures shall be established
in the storm water storage area and major
flood water passageway immediately following
the construction or reconstruction of these
areas. During the construction of the
overall development, it is recognized that a
limited amount of sediment buildup may occur
in the storm water storage area due to
erosion. In no case shall the volume of the
storage area be reduced to less than
three-quarters of the required volume during
the construction phase of the development.
23½-3
e. Permanent erosion control measures
such as mulching, hydroseeding, conventional
seeding, nurse crops, fertilizing, or sod
installation shall be utilized to control
soil movement and erosion within the storage
area and major flood water passageway.
These measures shall meet or exceed the
standards established by the Winnebago
County Soil and Water Conservation District.
The installation of these permanent measures
shall take place only after the majority of
construction and other silt and sediment
producing activities have been completed.
Prior to the establishment of the permanent
erosion control measures, the required
capacity of the storm water storage area and
the excess storm water passageway shall be
restored.
f. The control structure shall be
provided with an interceptor for trash and
debris, and it shall be designed and
constructed to prevent soil erosion and not
to require manual adjustments for its proper
operation. An inlet design that will
produce turbulent flow conditions during any
portion of the storm water storage cycle
will not be acceptable.
g. Adequate impact silting basins shall
be provided to ensure that downstream soil
erosion is alleviated and the regime of the
downstream drainage facility is not
disturbed.
h. Each storm water storage area shall
be provided with a method of overflow in the
event a storm in excess of the design
capacity occurs. This overflow facility
shall be constructed to function without
specific attention and can become a part of
the excess stormwater passageway described
in this section.
23½-4
i. The entire stormwater storage area
shall be designed and constructed to fully
protect the public health, safety, and
welfare. If a condition occurs in the
stormwater storage area which is hazardous
to the public health, safety, or welfare,
the person responsible for the condition
will be required to provide approved
corrective measures. In the event these
corrective measures are not provided, the
Village may eliminate the hazard at the
expense of the person responsible.
j. Low flow conduits or channels shall
be provided in storm water storage areas;
these conduits or channels shall be so
constructed that they will not interfere
with the secondary usage of the storage area
and will reduce the frequency of time that
the storage area will be covered with water.
2. WET BOTTOM STORM WATER STORAGE. Wet
bottom stormwater storage area shall be designed
in compliance with all of the regulations which
are applicable and govern the construction of dry
bottom stormwater storage area. The following
additional regulations shall apply:
a. The water surface area of the
permanent pool shall not exceed one-tenth of
the area of the tributary watershed.
b. Protection of the shoreline must be
provided to alleviate soil erosion due to
wave action.
c. Minimum normal water depth shall be
four feet. If fish are to be used to keep
the pond clean, at least one-quarter of the
pond area shall be a minimum of ten feet
deep.
d. Facilities shall be provided to
lower the pond elevation by gravity flow for
cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance.
23½-5
e. The control structure for stormwater
release shall be designed to operate at full
design release rate with only a minor
increase in the water depth in order to
minimize the land surface wetted by frequent
minor stormwater runoff conditions.
f. Measures shall be included in the
design to prevent pond stagnation. This may
be accomplished by fountain aeration or some
other method used to ensure aerobic pond
conditions.
g. The volume of water permanently
stored shall not be considered to be part of
the required excess stormwater storage
volume.
3. PAVED STORM WATER STORAGE. Design and
construction of the pavement base must insure
that there is no pavement damage due to flooding.
Control structures in paved areas must be readily
accessible for maintenance and cleaning. Vortex
control devices will be required.
4. ROOFTOP STORM WATER STORAGE. Rooftop
storage of excess storm water shall be designed
and constructed to provide permanent control
inlets and parapet walls to contain excess storm
water. Adequate structural roof design must be
provided to ensure that roof deflection does not
occur which could cause the roofing material to
fail and result in leakage. Overflow areas must
be provided to ensure that the weight of stored
storm water will never exceed the structural
capacity of the roof.
5. AUTOMOBILE PARKING STORM WATER STORAGE
AREAS. Automobile parking facilities used to
store excess storm water must be constructed
having a maximum depth of stored storm water of
1.5 feet; and these areas shall be located in the
most remote, least used areas of the parking
facility.
23½-6
6. UNDERGROUND STORM WATER STORAGE.
Underground storm water storage facilities must
be designed for easy access in order to remove
accumulated sediment and debris. These
facilities must be provided with a positive
outlet.
D. CALCULATIONS.
1. The volume of required storm water
storage shall be calculated on the basis of the
maximum value achieved from the runoff of a
100-year return frequency storm less the volume
of water released through the outlet structure.
Any generally recognized and substantiated method
acceptable to the Village Engineer may be used
for these calculations. The release rate of the
outlet structure when one half of the storage
area is filled may be used in lieu of routing
techniques in small drainage areas. The control
structure shall be designed to maintain as
uniform a flow as possible, independent of the
storm water storage volume. Where the proposed
structure, project, or land development forms
only a portion of a watershed or contains
portions of several watersheds, the storage
volume calculations shall be based upon the area
of the entire project, development, or land use
change. The maximum release rate shall be
established by multiplying the total acreage of
the tributary watershed by 0.2 cubic feet per
second per acre.
2. Storm water storage areas which will be
filled to capacity by high frequency storms shall
be designed in a manner that will protect
immediate downstream properties, and all overflow
structures shall be designed to function properly
and effectively without the necessity of making
manual adjustments. A larger outlet for a storm
water storage area may be permitted by the
Village Engineer for the orderly management of
storm water runoff where large tributary areas
are developed without detention.
23½-7
3. If the orderly management of the storm
water runoff cannot be achieved by passing the
entire tributary area runoff through the storm
water storage area, then the storm water storage
area shall be constructed to exclude the runoff
from the tributary area originating outside of
the area to be developed.
E. APPLICATION.
1. Storm water detention facilities shall be
designed by and their construction supervised by
a Registered Professional Engineer.
2. In addition, the following shall be
required by the Village Engineer:
a. Prior review of preliminary plans
and tentative plats;
b. To insure the completion of any
facilities required by the Article, a bond,
irrevocable letter of credit or other
suitable guarantee pursuant to Section 19-13

on display and in advertising such goods may be readily
distinguished from other stocks, and their identity readily

sentence, clause or portion of this Article is held invalid

other applicable State of Illinois or local ordinances or regulations.
4. That the variance shall involve only the least modification necessary
to provide relief.

the right to conduct on-site surveys and other applicable studies and present
testimony and evidence of same to the Village Floodplain Manager and
Planning & Zoning Commission.

warranty of any kind by the Village of Machesney Park or by an official or employee
thereof, of the practicability or safety of any structure, use or other plan proposed, and shall

ARTICLE X. COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS
SEC. Z-50. GENERAL PURPOSES
The commercial districts are established in this chapter in order to achieve the following general
purposes:
(1) To protect commercial areas against fire, explosion, noxious fumes, offensive noise, smoke,
vibrations, dust, odor, heat, glare and other objectionable influences incidental to industrial uses.
(2) To provide appropriately located areas for retail stores, offices, service establishments, wholesale
business and amusement establishments offering commodities and service required by residents
of the Village and its market area.
(3) To provide opportunities for retail stores, offices, service establishments, wholesale business and
amusement establishments to concentrate in certain areas for the convenience of the public and
for the beneficial relationship of each other.
(4) To provide for community facilities and institutions that may be located in commercial areas.
(5) To provide adequate space to meet the needs of commercial development, including off-street
parking and loading facilities.
(6) To minimize traffic congestion and to avoid the over loading of public facilities by regulating the
construction of building in relation to the area of the zoning lot.
(7) To minimize any blight, objectionable appearance, or detrimental effect to adjacent properties by
requiring all exterior structural surfaces and exterior areas of premises to be maintained in a
structurally sound, weatherproofed, and damage-free condition. (Ord. 4-97)
SEC. Z-51. SPECIAL PURPOSES
In addition to the general purposes prescribed in Section 20-50, each commercial district has been
established in this chapter to achieve the following special purposes:
Appendix A - 52
(1) The CN Commercial Neighborhood District is established for the convenience of persons residing
in nearby residential areas, and is limited to accommodating the basic recurring shopping needs
of the typical family. The area of the CN district should be limited in order to reduce the traffic
generated to an amount which will not be detrimental to the surrounding residential
neighborhood.
(2) The CC Commercial Community District is established to accommodate a greater variety of
goods and services than permitted in the CN District, including business establishments which
serve a larger segment of the Village than the immediate surrounding residential area. This
district includes the sub-regional shopping centers.
(3) The CG Commercial General District is established to accommodate a greater variety of goods
and services than permitted in the CC District, and to provide appropriately located areas for
commercial uses having features that are incompatible with the purpose of other commercial
districts.
SEC. Z-52. COMMERCIAL DESIGN STANDARDS
1. Intent. The commercial design standards are intended to elevate the standard of
the built environment in the Village of Machesney Park. The standards have
been written to attract quality, aesthetic developments that raise and maintain
property values in the Village. These minimum design standards offer
flexibility in order to recognize business identities that influence the look and
feel of commercial developments.
2. Applicability
a. New Buildings. The commercial design standards shall apply to all new
buildings constructed in the CN Commercial Neighborhood, CC
Commercial Community, CG Commercial General, and OF Office districts
as of the effective date of this Ordinance. (Excluded from these design
standards are public schools, colleges, universities and professional schools
that may be constructed in any of these zoning districts.)
b. Existing Buildings. These standards also apply to all existing structures in
the CN, CC, CG, and OF zoning districts that undergo improvements,
including, but not limited to, renovation, an addition, reconstruction,
painting, or exterior façade treatments, for which at least 25% of the surface
area of all building elevations are affected by the improvement. For existing
buildings, only the standards for applicable design elements will apply.
3. Interpretation of Standards. The commercial design standards provide a
consistent means to apply design criteria to all new developments. To maintain
consistent application of these standards, the Community Development
Department staff shall be responsible for administration of the commercial design
standards. Refer to review procedures in Paragraph 5.
4. Standards for Development
Appendix A - 53
a. Design elements required: The combination of design elements per Table A
below is required for any commercial property.
b. Building Form and Layout
(i) In developments with multiple structures, recurring forms and
materials shall be used to tie the development together, while

(c) In the CG Commercial General District there shall be no height regulations.
(3) Table of Uses. Permitted Uses and Special Uses in the Commercial Zoning Districts are found in
Article 13, Commercial and Industrial Table of Uses.
ARTICLE XI - OFFICE DISTRICT
SEC. Z-54. GENERAL PURPOSE
The OF District is established primarily to accommodate business and professional offices and
institutional uses. This district is applied to select locations throughout the Village. Being less restrictive
than the Residential Districts and, generally, more restrictive than the Commercial Districts.
SEC. Z-55. OFFICE DISTRICT REGULATIONS
(1) Yards. No building shall be erected or enlarged unless the following yards are provided and
maintained in connection with such building, structure or enlargement.
(a) FRONT. A front yard equal to at least one-half (1/2) the right-of-way of the street on
which the lot fronts; however, in no case shall the front yard be less than thirty (30) feet
nor require more than sixty (60) feet.
For buildings exceeding twenty-five (25) feet in height, the minimum front yard
determined above shall be increased by one foot for each two (2) feet or fraction thereof
by which the building height exceeds twenty-five (25) feet, but in no case shall a front
yard of more than sixty (60) feet be required.
(b) SIDE. On every zoning lot, side yards shall be provided as follows:
Every principal permitted use shall have a side yard on each side of not less than six (6)
feet and a combined total of side yards of not less than fifteen (15) feet when the structure
is not more than twenty-five (25) feet in height.
For principal structures exceeding twenty-five (25) feet in height, the minimum side yard
shall be increased by one (1) foot for each four (4) feet or fraction thereof by which the
building exceeds twenty-five (25) feet.
Appendix A - 62

increased to equal one-half (1/2) the right-of-way of the adjoining street with a minimum
of thirty (30) feet, but in no case shall a side yard of more than sixty (60) feet be required.
(c) REAR. A rear yard of not less than twenty-five (25) feet.
(2) Height. In the OF District, no building shall be erected or altered to a height in excess of seventyfive
(75) feet or eight (8) stories.
(3) Maximum Site Coverage. The maximum site coverage in the OF District shall not exceed fifty
(50%) percent of the lot area.
(4) Table of Uses. Permitted Uses and Special Uses in the Office Zoning District are found in Article
13, Commercial and Industrial Table of Uses.
ARTICLE XII. INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
SEC. Z-56. GENERAL PURPOSES
(1) The IL Light Industrial District is intended to accommodate light industrial, wholesale and
research establishments. The IL District may be located in various areas throughout the
Village and may be in close proximity to residential neighborhoods and not be
detrimental to residential uses because of its limited nature. While most often applied to
areas where the location of particular industries has no direct relationship to other nearby
business or industrial districts, it may also be formed as an adjunct to these established
districts.
(2) The IG General Industrial District is intended to accommodate those industrial uses
which may not or cannot meet the standards of the IL District yet do not have the
objectionable influences of those uses found in the IH District. The IG District should
not, where possible, be located in close proximity to a residential district.
(3) The IH Heavy Industrial District is to accommodate those heavier industrial uses which
have objectionable influences, but which, nevertheless, should be provided for in the
community. The IH District is, insofar as possible, applied to locations removed from the
residential districts on the basis of linear distance or natural or manmade features.
SEC. Z-57. INDUSTRIAL DESIGN STANDARDS
1. Intent. The industrial design standards are intended to elevate the standard of
the built environment in the Village of Machesney Park. The standards have
been written to attract quality, aesthetic developments that raise and maintain
property values in the Village. These minimum design standards recognize the
utilitarian nature of industrial developments while also recognizing that there
are possible design limitations that can occur due to the nature of the varying
industrial and manufacturing activities that take place.
2. Applicability
a. New Buildings. The industrial design standards shall apply to all new
buildings constructed in the IL Light Industrial, IG General Industrial, and
Appendix A - 63
IH Heavy Industrial districts as of the effective date of this Ordinance.
b. Existing Buildings. These standards also apply to all existing structures in
the IL, IG and IH zoning districts that undergo improvements, including, but
not limited to, renovation, reconstruction, painting, or exterior façade
treatments. Such improvements shall not affect more than:
(i) 25% of the surface area of all building elevations in a manner that does
not conform with the industrial design standards, or;
(ii) 25% of the total wall surface area of the primary, front facing elevation
in a manner that does not conform with the industrial design standards.
The applicable elements of the standards shall apply only to that portion of
the building that is being modified, updated, or improved.
Exterior painting projects are not required to obtain a permit from the
Village, but shall comply with the building color requirements in 4d.
These standards shall not apply when additions are built onto existing
industrial buildings. Rather, the facades of these building additions shall be
consistent to the color, material, and appearance of the existing building.
(Ordinance 34-17)
3. Interpretation of Standards. The industrial design standards provide a
consistent means to apply design criteria to all new developments. To maintain
consistent application of these standards, the Community Development
Department staff shall be responsible for administration of the industrial design
standards. Refer to review procedures in Paragraph 5.
4. Standards for Development
a. Design elements required: The design elements in Table A below are
required for all industrial properties.

safety and welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for the use of the property.
Appendix A - 84
SEC. Z-64. GENERAL PROVISIONS
(1) Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of this chapter apply as
follows:
(a) For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established after the
effective date of this chapter, accessory parking and loading facilities shall be provided as
regulations of the district in which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter, and provided
that construction is begun within ninety (90) days of such effective date and diligently
pursued to completion, parking and
loading facilities as required hereinafter need not be provided.
(b) When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises shall be
increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or other
units of measurement specified herein for required parking or loading facilities as
required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use. When a building
or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully established prior to the effective date of this
chapter increases in size or capacity by fifty (50%) percent or greater, the parking or
loading facilities required by this chapter shall be provided for the total use.
(2) Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking or lading facilities which are
located on the same lot as the building or use served and which were in existence on the effective
date of this chapter or were provide voluntarily after such effective date shall not further be
reduced below, or if already less than, shall not further be reduced below the requirements of this
chapter for a similar new building or use.
(3) Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land
or buildings; provided, that
all regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement and operation of such facilities
are adhered to.
(4) Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming building or use which is in
existence on the effective date of this chapter, which subsequent thereto is damaged or destroyed
by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired,
off-street parking or loading facilities need not be provided; except, that parking or loading
facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored
or continued in operation. However, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain
parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or
construction.
(5) Control of off-site parking facilities. When required parking facilities are provided on land other
than the zoning lot on which the building or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be
and remain in the same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use
to which the parking facilities are accessory. No such off-site parking facilities shall be
authorized and no certificate of zoning compliance shall be issued where the plans call for
parking facilities other than on the same zoning lot until and unless the Board of Appeals has
reviewed the plans and heard the applicant and made findings that the common ownership or
possession of the zoning lot and the site of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue
and that the off-site parking facilities will be maintained at all times during the life of the

SEC. Z-65. ADDITIONAL PARKING REGULATIONS
(1) Use of parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities accessory to residential use and developed in
any residential district in accordance with the requirements of this section shall be used solely for
the parking of passenger automobiles owned by occupants of the dwelling structures to which
such facilities are accessory or by guests of such occupants. Under no circumstances shall
required parking facilities accessory to residential structures be used for the storage of
commercial vehicles or for the parking of automobiles belonging to the employees, owners,
tenants, visitors or customers of business or manufacturing establishments.
(2) Joint parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities for different buildings, structures or uses, or
for mixed uses, may be provided collectively in any nonresidential zoning district in which
separate parking facilities for each constituent use would be permitted; provided, that the total
number of spaces so located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements
for each use (except as otherwise provided by this chapter).
(3) Existing parking. Off-street parking, existing at the time a new use or change in use is made, may
be considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission in granting a variation of parking
requirements. However, such off-street parking shall be adjacent to, or directly across the street
or alley from, but in no case at a distance in excess of four hundred fifty (450) feet, a use in a
residential district and in the case of a use in a commercial or industrial district, the municipal offstreet
parking shall be within one thousand (1000) feet from the use.
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not grant variations of parking requirements for more
spaces than eighty (80%) percent of each off-street parking lot, nor shall any one use receive a
parking variation of more than twenty (20%) percent of that eighty (80%) percent, nor shall more
than twenty-five (25%) percent of the off-street parking requirements of any one use be subject to
variation.
(4) Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this
chapter results in a requirement of a fraction of one-half (1/2) or less, that fraction may be
disregarded; while a fraction in excess of one-half (1/2) shall be counted as one parking space.
(5) Size. A required off-street parking space shall be at least nine (9) feet in width and at least
eighteen (18) feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, columns or office or work
areas. Such space shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven (7) feet. (Ord. 87-86)
(6) In yards. A parking space shall not be located in a required front yard or side yard, except in the
office, commercial or industrial districts.
(7) Design and maintenance.
(a) OPEN AND ENCLOSED PARKING SPACES. Accessory parking spaces located on
the same lot as occupied by the use served may be open to the sky or enclosed in a
building. Accessory parking spaces located in a residential district elsewhere than on the
Appendix A - 86
same lot occupied by the use served shall be open to the sky except when otherwise
allowed as a special use.
(b) SURFACING. All open off-street parking areas, except those parking spaces accessory
to a single-family dwelling, shall be improved with a minimum of a 6 inch base and an
A-2 bituminous covering as designated in Section 307 and 403.01. "Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction," State of Illinois Department of Public
Works and Building Divisions of Highways (current edition). Such parking areas shall
be so graded and drained as to dispose of all surface water, and in no case shall drainage
be allowed across sidewalks. Alternate surfacing is allowable provided it is of a higher
standard than those required by this chapter. (Ord. 10-88)
(c) SCREENING OR LANDSCAPING. This subsection is established to recognize the
public and private benefits of screening or landscaping of off-street parking facilities.
Those benefits include the ability of landscaping within parking areas to help control the
circulation of automobiles and pedestrians, identify entrances and exits, provide reference
points for locating automobiles, provide summer shade to people and automobiles,
provide open space for drainage and snow storage, improve the appearance of large
parking lots, and provide environmental and aesthetic benefits and be a positive asset to a
shopping area or a business establishment.
All open, off-street parking areas containing five (5) or more spaces, all open off-street
loading areas, and all open storage areas shall have effective screening on each side
adjoining or fronting on any residential district or any public or private street except
where the owner chooses to landscape in lieu of screening. Effective screening shall
consist of a solid fence, wall or compact hedge not less than 3 feet nor more than 4 feet in
height in front yards, and not less than 3 feet nor more than 6 feet in side and rear yards.
Where the owner chooses to landscape in lieu of screening the landscaping shall consist
of the following two requirements:
(1) Canopy (Shade) Trees
In Commercial districts every 12 parking spaces shall require one canopy tree 2” - 2-1/2”
caliper as measured 6” above the ground.
In Industrial districts every 24 parking spaces shall require one canopy tree 2” - 2-1/2”
caliper as measured 6” above the ground.
Parking areas of 48 parking spaces or more shall require at least 1/2 of required canopy
trees to be planted in interior planting islands of at least 70 sq. ft.
(2) Point System for Landscaping Elements. The number of points required shall be
determined by the formula:
Parking
Each parking space in a Commercial district shall equal 5 points.
(Total number of parking spaces X 5 points = Total points)
Each parking space in an Industrial district shall equal 2.5 points.
Appendix A - 87
(Total number of parking spaces X 5 points = Total points)
Loading areas
Each loading berth shall equal 75 points.
Open storage areas
Total square feet of outdoor storage area divided by 300 and then multiplied by 5 points.
The required total points shall be utilized on the basis of the following point values for
individual landscaping elements.
Element Point Value
canopy tree* 2" - 2-1/2" caliper 75
canopy tree or small tree 1-1/2" - 2" caliper 30
evergreen trees (minimum height 36 inches) 30
decorative wall or fence –
minimum height 3 feet (per 10 linear feet) 10
earth berm - average height 30" 10
earth berm - average height 15" 5
(per 10 linear feet)
evergreen shrub
variety of plant sizes recommended 5
deciduous shrub
variety of plant sizes recommended 3
*trees required in (1) are not to be included in the point count
A credit allowance toward the total points required will be provided for existing landscape
elements at the same point values as in the table above.
Required screening along district boundary lines, adjacent to parking, loading and storage areas,
will count toward required points for the area being treated.
Landscaping elements within or adjacent to open, off street parking areas shall be protected from
automobiles. Trees, shrubs, and other landscaping materials depicted on landscaping
plans approved by the Village shall be considered to be elements of the project in the
same manner as parking, building materials and other details. The required landscaping
shall be properly maintained or replaced as needed. (Ord. 56-96)
(d) LIGHTING. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be directed
away from residential properties in such a way as not to create a nuisance.
(e) SIGNS. Signs are permitted on parking areas when related to and accessory to the
parking area.
(8) Floor area exemptions. When two (2) or more uses are located on the same zoning lot, only one
exemption in terms of floor area, as set forth in Section 20-59, shall be permitted.
(9) PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED PARKING
1. If any parking is provided for employees, visitors, or both, the minimum number of
accessible parking spaces to be provided for physically impaired persons are as follows:
Appendix A - 88
Total Off-Street Parking Required Minimum Number

(b) The physically impaired parking stalls shall be at least sixteen feet wide by twenty feet
long for 90 degree parking and shall be proportionately larger at other angles.
All stalls shall be appropriately marked and signed, be located in close proximity to the
principle building and shall offer barrier free access to the principle building.
(c) No accessible parking shall be required if only attendant or valet parking is provided and
is available at all times the facility is open for pubic use. However, if accessible at-grade
parking is available, at least one space for self parking of a vehicle with sensitive
specialized control devices shall be provided. The designation of physically impaired
parking stalls shall constitute consent by the property owner to the enforcement of the
restriction of such spaces to physically impaired motorists by the Village.
(d) The total number of accessible parking spaces may be distributed among parking lots, if
greater accessibility is achieved in consideration of such factors as anticipated usage,
number and location of entrances and level of parking areas. (Ord. 80-89)
SEC. Z-66. LOCATION OF ACCESSORY OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES

which may be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission or by court of record on
application, with notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and all due causes

SEC. Z-88. SPECIAL USES
(1) Purpose. The formulation and enactment of this chapter is based on the division of the
entire Village into districts in each of which are permitted specified uses that are
compatible. In addition to such permitted, compatible uses, however, it is recognized that
there are other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district but,
because of their potential influence upon neighboring uses, need to be carefully regulated
with respect to location or operation for the protection of the community. Such uses are
classified in this chapter as "special uses."
(2) Application and fee.

intervals of not more than five (5) feet and existing and proposed locations
of streets, property lines, uses, structures, driveways, pedestrian walks,
off-street parking and off-street loading facilities and landscaped areas.
3. The Zoning Officer may authorize omission of any or all of the

proposed use will comply with each of the applicable provisions of this
chapter.
(c) FEE. The application shall be accompanied by a fee as follows to cover the cost
of processing the application as described in this Article:

to make an affirmative recommendation on any special use permit, it must
consider the following items: (Ord. 112-88)
1. The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will
not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort

orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district;

(e) The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the Village Board
may require such conditions or restrictions upon the construction, location and
operation of a special use as deemed necessary for the protection of the adjacent
properties. These conditions may include the expiration of the special use permit
after a specified period of time and off-street parking and loading requirements in
accordance with the provisions of the ordinance.
(f) If the Planning and Zoning Commission fails to act within forty-five (45) days of

special use permit application, or a certificate of occupancy is issued for the
structure which was the subject of the special use permit application or the site
was occupied if no building permit or certificate of occupancy is required.
(b) A special use permit may be renewed for an additional period of one year;
provided, that prior to the expiration of one year from the date when the special

(c) The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant or deny an application for
renewal of a special use permit.
(d) Subsections (2)(a)(b) and (3) of this section shall apply to an application for

with the conditions prescribed in the special use permit as granted, if any. Any
alterations, expansion or restoration shall be thereafter governed by the provisions of this
chapter.

conditions, a special use permit shall be suspended automatically. The Planning and
Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing within forty-five (45) days, in accord
with the procedure prescribed in subsection (3) (a) of this section, and if not satisfied that
the regulation, general provision or condition is being complied with, may revoke the
special use permit or take such action as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the
regulation, general provision or condition. Within five (5) days following the date of a
decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission revoking a special use permit, the
Zoning Officer shall transmit to the Village Board written notice of the decision. The
decision shall become final ten (10) days following the date on which the special use
Appendix A - 110
permit was revoked or on the day following the next meeting of the Village Board

Village Board shall elect to review the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission,
in which cases subsections four (4) to six (6) of this section shall apply.
(8) Effect or Denial of a Special Use Permit. No application for a special use permit which
has been denied only or partly by the Village Board shall be resubmitted for a period of

changed conditions.

complies with all of the provisions of the original special use permit and all of the
provisions set forth in this section. (Ord. 51-89)
SEC. Z-89. VARIATIONS
(1) Purpose. The Planning and Zoning Commission is empowered to recommend variations
in order to prevent or to lessen such practical difficulties and unnecessary physical
hardships inconsistent with the objectives of the Zoning Ordinance as would result from a
strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of certain regulations prescribed by this
ordinance. A practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship may result from the
size, shape, or dimensions of a site or from population densities, street locations, or traffic
conditions in the immediate vicinity. Recommending the variance will not merely serve
as a convenience to the applicant, but is necessary to alleviate some demonstrable
difficulty. Cost to the applicant of strict or literal compliance with a regulation shall not
be the sole reason for recommending a variation. A variation shall be recommended by
the Planning and Zoning Commission only in accordance with the standard set forth
above and only in the following instances and no other.
(a) To permit any yard of less dimension than required by the applicable regulations;

limitation imposed by the applicable regulations; but in no case shall such
variation exceed ten (10%) percent; (Ord. 27-87)

lot, but in no event, shall the area of the lot be less than ninety (90%) percent of
the required lot area;

spaces are permitted to be located from the use served; and

that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served; and
(f) To permit the same off-street parking facilities to qualify as a required facility for
two (2) or more uses; provided, the substantial use of such facility by each user
does not take place at approximately the same hours of the same days of the week.
(g) To waive or modify the screening requirements of Section 20-8, subsection
(5)(e)(2) of this chapter, or to permit any fence, wall or other enclosure which is
greater than or less than the required height limit. (Ord. 6-85)

this section, the application shall be accompanied by an accurate scale
drawing of the site and the surrounding area for a distance of at least three
hundred (300) feet from each boundary of the site showing the existing

a written finding of fact. For the Planning and Zoning Commission to make an
affirmative decision on any proposed variation, it must consider the following
items: (Ord. 112-88)
1. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
2. The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not
applicable, generally to other property within the same zoning
classification;
3. The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to increase the value or income potential of the property;
4. The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located;
5. The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets or increase the danger of fire, endanger public safety or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
and

restrictions imposed by this chapter.

SEC. Z-95. MULTI-FAMILY PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
(1) Purpose. The Village’s multi-family planned unit development (PUD) ordinance is intended to
encourage unique and innovative land development that supports a high quality of life,
sustainable, quality development, and to achieve environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency,
and other Village goals. While the Village may allow flexible project design through the PUD
process, standards are provided through this Ordinance to protect public health and safety; to
assure design quality; to promote consistency with the Comprehensive Plan; and to ensure
congruity with nearby and adjacent neighborhoods. In addition, the Village seeks to achieve
the following specific objectives through the planned unit development ordinance:
Appendix A - 125
(a) Secure high-quality developments that protect environmentally-sensitive areas by
capitalizing on special site characteristics, locations and uses;
(b) Encourage multi-family residential projects that complement the unique architectural styles
and development patterns defined by nearby and surrounding neighborhoods;
(c) Ensure the creation and enhancement of friendly, safe, and welcoming residential
development projects;
(d) Provide a higher standard of living for residents in Machesney Park;
(e) Establish neighborhoods that enhance the livability of the community by providing places
for social interaction and recreation;
(2) Application of Multi-family Planned Unit Development Standards
(a) Applicability. Planned Unit Developments shall be required for all multi-family residential
development projects that contain 9 or more units, whether in one building or multiple
buildings.
(b) Intent. If it is determined by the Village that an owner/developer is intending to
circumvent the requirements of the PUD ordinance by developing multiple phases of multifamily
structures in 8 or less units, the Village reserves the right not to issue permits and
can require a developer to file an application for a Planned Unit Development.
(3) Planned Unit Development standards.
(a) Location. A multi-family residential PUD can be located in any R3 or R4 residential
zoning district in the Village, including any land proposed for annexation.
(b) Compatibility. Development within a PUD must be compatible with adjacent and nearby
existing or proposed future development. In cases where there are issues of compatibility,
the PUD must provide for transition areas at the edges of the development that provide for
appropriate buffering and/or ensure a complimentary character of development.
Complimentary character shall be identified based on densities and intensity, lot size and
dimensions, building height, architectural design, building mass and scale, exterior lighting,
and landscape and natural features.
Appendix A - 126
(c) Phasing. If different phases of development are proposed for the PUD, a development
phasing plan shall be provided that identifies the general sequence or phases in which the
land will be developed, including how residential and nonresidential development will be
timed, how infrastructure (public and private) and open space will be provided and timed,
and how development will be coordinated with the Village’s TIF Redevelopment Plan, if
applicable, and any planned public improvements. The phasing plan shall be established at
the time of approval of the PUD and shall be consistent with the growth management
schedule.
(d) Public utilities. The developer shall provide written confirmation from the applicable
public water and public sanitary sewer service providers that adequate public utilities are
available and will not be negatively impacted by the proposed PUD. Written
confirmation and a utility plan indicating all proposed utilities and easements shall be
provided with the applicant’s PUD application.
(e) Public improvements. Upon approval, the PUD ordinance shall outline the
owner/developer’s responsibilities for providing and constructing on-site and off-site
facilities for right-of-way, roadways and entrances, public utilities (including, but not
limited to water and sanitary sewer), easements, and any other required infrastructure to
support the proposed multi-family residential development. The PUD ordinance shall
also establish the responsibility of the owner/developer to make any other improvements
as required by Village codes or ordinance, and, if requested by the Village, the developer
shall dedicate necessary improvements to the Village.
(f) Surety. An opinion of probable construction costs for all public improvements associated
with the PUD shall be provided with the PUD application, where applicable. Upon
review and approval of the opinion of probable construction costs, a surety to cover the
cost of required public improvements in accordance with the provisions of the Village’s
subdivision standards must be submitted prior to the issuance of any permits for an
approved PUD.
(g) Non-residential uses. Non-residential uses are not allowed within a multi-family
residential PUD, with the exception of the following development amenities:

unified control. Unified control of property under multiple-ownership may be
accomplished through the use of enforceable covenants or the enabling PUD ordinance.
If land within a PUD is sold and/or ownership or controlling interest transferred, said
actions shall be conditioned upon the new owners or controlling interest agreeing to
build/develop the lot/land in accordance with the approved PUD approvals. Building
permits shall only be issued for structures which conform to the approved PUD.
(j) Traffic Impact Study. A traffic impact study shall be provided with every PUD
application for 25 or more residential units. All traffic impact studies shall be completed
by a professional traffic engineer (PTOE). The Village shall, after reviewing the
credentials and previous work of the owner/developer’s consulting engineer, maintain
the right to reject any proposed traffic engineer. The traffic study shall be paid for by the
owner/developer. The Village engineer shall be responsible for determining the scope of
the traffic study, and shall determine the study area, which will generally include the
entire development area as well as all existing right-of-ways and intersections within ½
(one-half) mile of the development area. The traffic study shall include, at minimum, the
following:
a. An analysis of the existing and proposed conditions within the study area;
b. An estimate the average number of daily traffic trips that will generated by the
development, as outlined by the growth management plan;
c. A capacity analysis of all major access points, signalized and un-signalized
intersections within the study area.

landscaping;
e. Other criteria or extraordinary amenities, not listed above, which may meet the
development goals of the Village.
(m) Special Use Permit Review Standards. Multi-family residential PUD’s are considered
by the Village as Special Use Permits, and shall therefore demonstrate compliance with
the following findings of fact criteria:
a. The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be
detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general
welfare;
b. The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in
the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, not substantially diminish
and impair property values within the neighborhood;

(5) Planned Unit Development Review Process.
(a) Multi-family residential planned unit development process. The planned unit development
process is intended to serve the community as a public engagement tool that includes residents
and neighbors in the development review process for multi-family residential planned unit
developments. The planned unit development process shall consist of the following 4-step
process:
a. Staff review, which may include outside review consultants, as determined by Village
staff;
b. Public hearing and review by the Planning and Zoning Commission;
c. Review by the Planning and Economic Development Committee;
d. Review by the Village President and Board of Trustees over two readings.
(b) Pre-application conference. Before submitting required materials for a preliminary planned unit
development review, the applicant shall request and participate in a pre-application meeting with
the Community Development Department. The purpose of the meeting is to informally discuss
the general concept of the proposed development, as well as the Village’s review process and
development standards.
(c) Application. Refer to the Planned Unit Development application handout, available through the
Community Development Department, for specific explanations of submittal requirements. Any
person owning real property in the Village of Machesney Park may file an application for a
planned unit development subject to the general provisions of this Ordinance. The application
shall be made in writing and shall be accompanied by plans and other information as required in
the application form, along with a proper filing fee.
(d) Procedure. Upon receipt of an application for a planned unit development, the Community
Development Department shall forward copies of application to the members of the Planning
and Zoning Commission, members of the Planning and Economic Development Committee, and
to the Village President and Board of Trustees.
(e) Public hearing and notice. Upon receipt of a petition for a planned unit development, the
Planning and Zoning Specialist shall schedule a public hearing before the Planning and Zoning
Commission, allowing adequate time for proper notice.
(f) Report. Within 45 days, or as soon as agenda schedule permits, after all pertinent information
has been received from the petitioner, and as necessary from the Village Staff, the petition shall
be placed on the Planning and Zoning Commission agenda. The Community Development
Department may require an earlier submittal date, if the proposed PUD is expected to require
additional staff review time. Hearing/meeting dates shall not be established until all required
Appendix A - 132
submittals are received by the Community Development Department. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall review the proposed petition and report its findings to the Village Board as
provided in this section.
(g) Recommendations. Within 45 days following the public hearing, excluding any continuation of
such hearing or extensions requested by the petitioner, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall forward its recommendations to the Planning and Economic Development Committee and
the Village Board.
(h) Conditions. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the Village Board, in
granting any planned unit development, may impose such conditions or restrictions as appear
necessary to minimize possible detrimental effects of such special use upon other properties in
the neighborhood.
(i) Action by the Village Board. The Village Board, upon receipt thereof, may adopt, with or
without modification, reject or deny, the report and recommendations of the Planning and
Zoning Commission, or may refer any matter back to the Planning and Zoning Commission for
further consideration. In addition, any proposed planned unit development which fails to receive
a positive recommendation of 2/3 of all the appointed Planning and Zoning Commission
members then holding office as required by this Ordinance, shall not be approved by the Mayor
and the Village Board of Trustees except by a favorable vote of 2/3 of all the Village Board
members then holding office.
(j) Failure to start construction on a multi-family residential PUD. Approval of a planned unit
development shall be valid for one year after approval by Village Board. The Village President
and Board of Trustees may, for good cause, approve an extension of a planned unit
development. The Village may note grant more than three one-year extensions.
(k) Amendments to a Planned Unit Development. Any changes to an approved planned unit
development plan may first require an amendment, prior to construction. The Community
Development Department shall review any plan changes or deviations and determine whether or
not the changes are substantive and if so, will require an amendment. An amendment to the
PUD shall follow the same process as a new PUD, as outlined above. When amending an
approved final PUD plan, unless the homeowners' association, where one is present, is
authorized to act on behalf of the entire development, every property owner within the PUD is
required to consent to the amendment to the PUD.
Appendix A - 133
(l) Fees. Administrative review fees shall be submitted with every PUD application. Fees shall be
based upon the size of the proposed development.
Up to and including 5.0 acres - $500
Each additional 5 acres - $50

(7) Procedures for Decisions. Depending upon the proposed action, site development plans shall
be considered under one of the following procedures.
(a) Plans Associated with Special Use Permits. Plans which are filed with an application
for a special use permit shall be processed as a part of the special use permit under the
procedures and requirements of the Machesney Park Zoning Ordinance. All other site
development plans shall be approved under the following procedure.
(b) Plans Associated with Zoning Permits or Building Permits. Within thirty (30) days of
the date of application (unless otherwise extended to a mutually agreeable date), the
Director of Community Development shall approve or deny site development plans in
accord with these requirements. In rendering a decision to approve or deny a site
development plan, the Director of Community Development may seek and rely on
information and opinions provided by Village of Machesney Park Officials, and other
professionals including, but not limited to: the Director of Planning and Zoning, Village
Engineer, Director of Public Works, and Village Attorney.
Should an owner be aggrieved of any decision in the approval or denial of a Site

applicable, shall consider the criteria listed below, as appropriate.
(a) Conformance with Ordinances. The application shall comply with the provisions of this
ordinance and other ordinances of the Village and of any other applicable laws.
(b) Comprehensive Plan. The plan shall be in reasonable conformity with the
Comprehensive Plan and any specific recommendations associated, or related to the
subject property.
Appendix A - 138
(c) Land-Use Compatibility and Integration. The overall design integrates neighborhood
and site characteristics into a compatible expression of building mass, building scale,
circulation and site improvements.
(d) Minimize Impacts to Surrounding Land-Uses. The spatial and functional design
minimizes the potential impacts of noise, light, debris, and other undesirable effects of
development upon adjoining properties and the area in general.
(e) Architectural Innovation. The plan is innovative in the design of structures by varying
vertical and horizontal planes of building facades, and makes creative use of building
materials in establishing an overall architectural "theme" for the development.
(f) Signage. Signage is designed compatible in scale and character with the overall
development.
(g) Site Access. Access to the site is designed to safely and efficiently facilitate ingress and
egress. The use of shared curb-cuts and cross-access easements should be provided
when appropriate. One curb cut per site shall be allowed, unless documentation is
provided demonstrating the need for additional curb-cuts.
(h) Vehicle Circulation and Parking. Adequate provision has been made for traffic
circulation which is coordinated with, and minimizes impacts to the adjoining street
system. The plan should also demonstrate the provision of safe and convenient offstreet
parking and loading areas. When appropriate, cross-access easements should be
provided between adjoining properties to allow for expanded on-site circulation of
vehicles.
(i) Pedestrian Circulation. Adequate provision has been made to ensure that the
development will not create hazards to the safety of pedestrian traffic on or off the site,
disjointed vehicular or pedestrian circulation paths, or undue interference and
inconvenience pedestrian travel.
(j) Utilities and Community Facilities. Reasonable provision has been made to ensure that
development will be served by essential public facilities and services such as police and
fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, public water supply, wastewater
collection, and related facilities.
(k) Screening and landscaping. The arrangement and selection of landscaping materials
should reinforce functional use areas of the site as well as add natural beauty. Screening
in the form of fences, walls and landscaping should minimize the potential for
nuisance impacts to surround properties.
(l) Lighting. On-site lighting shall provide for adequate illumination for vehicle and
pedestrian safety. Lighting should not be permitted to illuminate adjoining properties.
(m) Detention and Retention Facilities. When appropriate, detention and retention facilities
should be designed to provide for shared storage between properties. Detention and
retention facilities should be appropriate landscaped.
The Director of Community Development and the Village Board, as applicable, shall not
unreasonably or capriciously disapprove a site development plan which conforms to the
following: the Village of Machesney Park Zoning Ordinance; the Village of Machesney Park
Comprehensive Plan; the Village of Machesney Park Subdivision Ordinance; the Village of
Machesney Park Building Codes Ordinance; the Village of Machesney Park Storm Water
Detention Regulation; and, any and all other Village ordinances which are clearly and
reasonably applicable to the site development plan.
Appendix A - 139
(9) Conditions on Plans. The approving authority may impose reasonable conditions in granting
plan approval to minimize any negative impacts or minimize any adverse impacts due to the
development.
(10) Modifications of Plans. Changes to site development plans require reconsideration and reapproval
under the appropriate procedure.
(11) Lapse of Approval. Unless extended by the approving authority, and unless a building permit
has been issued and construction commenced, site development plan approval shall
automatically lapse one (1) year after the date of approval of the plan. (Ord. 5-97)

Ord. 93-95 - 12/18/95)
2. DRAINAGE:
(a) STORM GENERALLY. Storm drainage improvements
consisting of storm sewers and/or open channels shall
adequately drain the area being developed and also all
of the area, which naturally drains through the area
being developed. The design of drainage improvements
shall be coordinated with present and probable future
improvements so as to form part of an integrated
system. Storm water detention facilities shall be
designed in accordance with the "Storm Water Detention
Regulation" of Village Ordinance No. 17-87. Appropriate
grading may be required.
(b) STORM SEWERS. Storm sewers of adequate design
shall be installed. In general, storm sewer capacity
shall be sufficient to provide for the run-off of a
storm of a five (5) year frequency and a rainfall
intensity curve of one and three-tenths (1.3) inches
per hour as computed by the rational method of design.
Appropriate grading of open channels of capacity to
carry run-off for a storm of ten (10) year frequency
may be required in lieu thereof. The developers
engineer shall submit a drainage report to support the
storm sewer design to the Village Engineer for approval
before any construction shall commence. (Amd. Ord. 69-
96 - 12/9/96)

slope which shall provide a minimum velocity of three
feet per second when flowing full.
(f) SUBSIDIARY DRAINAGE PLAT.
(1) The developer's engineer shall prepare a
subsidiary drainage plat and shall submit the plat
to the Village Engineer for approval at least 48
hours prior to the commencement of development or
construction activities. (Amd. Ord. 6-95 -
3/13/95)
(2) The subsidiary drainage plat shall be
drawn or printed on paper twenty-four (24") inches
wide by thirty-six (36") inches long at a minimum
scale of one hundred (100') feet to one (1") inch,
unless otherwise approved by the Plat Officer.
(3) Required content of the subsidiary drainage
plat:
(a) Finished yard grades at building
setback lines. Generally, finished yard
grades at building setback lines shall be a
minimum of twelve (12") inches and a maximum
of thirty-six (36") inches above the top of
the street or street curb. Should topography
and/or parcel configuration characteristics
make this rule impractical, a greater degree
of variance may be permitted only as
authorized by the Village Board.
(b) The following note shall appear on
the plat:
The final grade of each lot is shown on this
subsidiary drainage plat. The subdivision has
been designed so that storm water drains away from
each building area in a systematic manner. The
subsidiary drainage plat is on file at the Village
of Machesney Park Planning Department.
It is the responsibility of the developer
and/or Builder of each lot to assure that the
grades and drainage of each lot is in compliance
with the approved subsidiary drainage plat.
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-37
Each lot owner shall be responsible for
maintaining the integrity of the individual lot
drainage as per the approved subsidiary drainage
plat after construction and shall comply with the
drainage plan when constructing accessory
structures, fences or landscaping. (Amd. Ord. 53-
93 - 10/12/93)
(g) DRYWELLS. Drywells shall be used only within
water detention (storage) facilities as outlined in
Chapter 23 1/2 of the Code of the Village of Machesney
Park. Drywells shall not be used within any public
right of way, or in any location that will cause
flooding or the standing of water within the public
right of way. (Amd. Ord. 43-98 - 8/24/98)
3. PUBLIC SANITARY SEWERS:
(a) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. Sanitary sewers
shall be provided and shall serve all lots where
connection thereto is practicable and permitted by
the controlling authority of the sewer system.

B-38
three (3') feet beyond the property line and shall
normally be located at the low side of the lot.
They shall be laid at a minimum slope of one per
cent. (Amd. Ord. 53-93 - 10/12/93)
(g) MANHOLES. Manholes shall be of standard
design. They shall be spaced not more than four
hundred (400) feet apart.
4. SAFETY BARRICADES:
The subdivider shall place barricades, as required
by the Village Engineer, at the end of streets to be
later extended.
5. FREEWAYS, ARTERIAL HIGHWAYS, SECONDARY
HIGHWAYS, SECTION LINE ROADS:
Where an arterial highway, secondary highway or
section line road is to be improved at greater than
minor residential streets standards, the subdivider's
share in the costs of improvements shall be equal to
the cost of a minor residential street in the same
location. Standard "A" shall be utilized for
determining the cost of improvements.
6. DEFERRED CONSTRUCTION:
In the case of sidewalks and whenever else it is
deemed necessary by the Village Board to defer the
construction of any improvement required herein, the
subdivider shall entrust his share of the cost of the
future improvement with the Village Board.
7. STREET SIGNS:

responsibility of the developer to purchase and install
all signs required by the Village. All signs shall
conform to specifications established by the
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-39
Superintendent of Streets. (Amd. Ord. 16-00 - 5/15/00)
103.114. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
The following standard requirements shall apply to all
new subdivisions of land. These standards shall be
interpreted, however, to encourage new and improved design
techniques with the object of promoting better subdivisions.
(a) CONFORMITY TO COMMUNITY PLANS:
All subdivisions shall conform to the general and
detailed specifications of plans or segments thereof, adopted
pursuant to the authority contained in Chapter 34 of the
Illinois Revised Statutes, to the Zoning Ordinance, setback
regulation, the limited-access road regulation, and to any
other adopted ordinances, resolutions, regulations and plans.
(b) STREETS:
l. GENERAL DESIGN.
All streets shall be designed in substantial relation
to:
(a) Topographic conditions and drainage;
(b) Public convenience and safety;
(c) The proposed uses of the land to be served by
such streets.
2. PUBLICLY PLANNED STREETS.
Streets shall be laid out in conformity to street or
highway plans officially adopted by the Village Board.
Wherever such a planned street or highway runs through a
proposed subdivision, it shall be provided for in the place
and with the width indicated on such plan. However, no more
than one hundred and twenty (l20) feet width of right-of-way
dedication shall be required for any street. Any additional
right-of-way specified on the plan shall be reserved for
circulation purposes by easement provisions.
3. SECTION LINE ROADS.
One hundred (l00) foot wide streets shall be laid out
on section and half-section lines, where possible. Where
physical obstructions occur, or where a more appropriate
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-40
location can be found, such roads may deviate from section
and half-section lines; provided, that the required width of
one hundred (100) feet is carried through to a suitable
connection. Such deviations shall be made only with the
consent and approval of the Plat Officer and the Village
Engineer.
4. ALIGNMENT AND CONTINUATION.
Where streets are not a part of the comprehensive plan
or officially adopted street or highway plans, the
arrangement of the streets in a subdivision shall either
provide for the alignment and continuation or appropriate
projection of existing principal streets in surrounding
areas, or conform to an approved plan for the neighborhood
which meets a particular situation where topographic or other
conditions make continuance of or conformance to existing
streets impracticable.
5. RESIDENTIAL STREETS.
Minor residential streets shall be laid out so that
their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
6. MARGINAL ACCESS STREETS.
Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad
right-of-way or limited-access road right-of-way, a street
shall be located approximately parallel to and at least one
lot depth distance from each side of such right-of-way, or at
a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land, as for park purposes in residential
district, or for commercial or industrial purposes in
appropriate districts, except where it is deemed necessary
that a through street be continued without deflection, or
that marginal access streets parallel and adjacent to such
right-of-way be provided. Such distances shall also be determined
with due regard for the requirements of approach
grades and future grade separations.
7. NATURAL FEATURES.
Streets paralleling streams, rivers, ravines, bluffs,
or other similar natural features shall be located approximately
one lot depth away from such natural feature in order
that the intervening land may be developed into private lots
meeting the requirement of this regulation. The Forest
Preserve District, or other local governmental bodies shall
have been given a sixty (60) day opportunity to acquire such
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-41
intervening land prior to final plat approval; provided that
approval of the final plat shall not be delayed more than
sixty (60) days after the date notice has been given to such
local governmental bodies for reason of their failure to take
action.
Streets paralleling such natural features and so close
to them as to leave an intervening strip of land that cannot
be developed into lots meeting the requirements of this
regulation may be permitted, provided that the intervening
land is dedicated to and accepted by the Forest Preserve
District, or other governmental bodies.
Lake and stream shore subdivision shall provide one or
more streets or rights-of-way, running to the low water mark
at one mile intervals as measured along the lake or stream
shore, except where streets or rights-of-way already exist
at not more than one mile intervals. The subdivider may
place use restrictions on these stub streets to control
until such time as a bridge is extended.
8. RESERVE STRIPS.
Reserve or "spite" strips controlling access to
perimeter streets shall not be permitted on the perimeter of
a development. Streets shall be located on the edge of or
one lot depth away from the edge of the tract with due
consideration being given to adjacent development.
9. STREET WIDTHS.
Where not otherwise specified, street right-of-way
widths shall be not less than sixty-six (66) feet for
residential streets eighty feet (80') for
commercial/industrial streets, and eighty feet (80') to onehundred
feet (100') for collector or arterial routes. Where
unusual conditions warrant, short streets and courts serving
ten (10) lots or less may be platted with a width of sixty
(60) feet. (Amd. Ord. 53-93 - 10/12/93)
10. HALF STREETS. Half streets shall not be permitted.
11. DEAD-END STREETS.
Dead-end streets, as such, shall not be permitted.
Cul-de-sacs designed to be permanent shall not be longer than
five hundred (500) feet and shall be provided with a turnaround
not less than one hundred twenty (120) feet in
diameter at the closed end. The length of the cul-de-sac
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-42
shall be measured from the intersection of the center lines
of the right of way of the nearest intersecting street to the
center of the cul-de-sacs. (Amd. Ord 55-06 – 01-08-2007)
12. STREET NAME.
Streets that are extensions of, or obviously in
alignment with existing streets, shall bear the names of the
existing streets; however, no other street shall bear names
which duplicate, or so nearly duplicate as to be confused
with the names of existing streets. North-south streets
shall be called "streets" and east-west streets shall be
called "avenues". The term "boulevard" shall be reserved for
streets with divided pavement. In all cases, street names
shall have a suffix.
13. PRIVATE STREETS.
Private streets shall not be permitted. The only
exception to this provision shall be when the subdivider
submits satisfactory evidence that there can be no public
interest in such private street.
(c) ALLEYS: Alleys, service courts, and other similar
ways shall not be permitted in residential areas.
(d) BLOCKS: Block lengths shall not exceed nineteen
hundred (1,900) feet. Excessively short blocks will be
discouraged.
(e) LOTS: All lots shall meet the minimum width,
depth, and area requirements of the zoning ordinance.
Where utility sewer and utility water are not provided,
the minimum area of any residential lot shall be twenty-five
thousand (25,000) square feet based upon suitable soil and
percolation tests by Winnebago County's Public Health
Department. Where utility water is provided the minimum area
may be reduced by five thousand (5,000) square feet. In
addition the minimum area may be further reduced when the
results of tests meet the standards of the Winnebago County
Health Department.
The Planning and Economic Development Committee of the
Village Board may further reduce the required minimum area
for any subdivision when the developer establishes to the
committee's satisfaction, based upon the report of a
registered professional engineer and the opinion of the
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-43
County Health Officer, that the public health will be in no
way endangered and that the interest of the public will be
preserved. However, in no case shall the lot area be less
than what is required by the zoning ordinance.
When the Planning and Economic Development committee of
the Village Board has reason to believe that a particular
area should not be subdivided for reasons of poor drainage
and the possibility of creating health problems, it may
require that additional soil tests be made. If the soils do
not meet the minimum requirements, the area in question shall
not be subdivided until utility sewer or utility water is
provided.
(1) SOIL TEST. Any areas not served by sanitary
sewers must abide by the Winnebago County Health
Department requirements for septic systems.
(2) BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL LOTS. Business and
industrial areas shall be subdivided into lots of such
size and shape as to meet business or industrial needs.
Properties reserved or laid out for commercial and
industrial purposes shall be large enough to provide
for the off-street loading and parking facilities
required by the type of use and development
contemplated.
(3) REMNANTS. Subdivisions shall contain no left
over pieces, corners or remnants of land.
(4) CORNER LOTS. Corner lots shall be wide
enough so that buildings conform with building setback
lines on both streets.
(5) STREET ACCESS. Each lot shall be provided
with satisfactory access to a public street by means of
frontage on such street. No lot shall front on a
street that has been designated by the Village Board as
a "limited-access road".
(6) BUILDING LINES. Residential building setback
lines shall be established at a distance back from each
street right-of-way line equal to no less than one-half
(½) the width of the street right-of-way and not closer
to such line than those established on the same street
in adjoining subdivisions.
(f) EASEMENTS. Utility easements not less than five
(5) feet wide shall be provided on each side of all rear lot
lines and where required by the utility along side lot lines.
Where abutting unsubdivided land, or natural features such as
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-44
a detention pond, easements shall be ten (10) feet.
Easements not less than five (5) feet wide shall be
provided along abutting side lot lines where deemed necessary
by the Department of Public Works for the purpose of street
lighting.
The subdivider shall install electrical power lines,
either overhead or underground, to and through the easement
to the proposed locations of said street lights.
Where the character or topography of the land in a
subdivision is such that it is impossible or impractical to
place streets so that they carry off the surface water, the
appropriate easements along lot lines shall be provided and
improved, where necessary, to carry off surface water in open
channels or storm sewers.
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainage way, channel or stream, appropriate dedication or
easement provisions, with adequate width or construction to
accommodate storm water and drainage through and from the
subdivision shall be made. Where a drainage way carries
water from one hundred (l00) or more acres of land, such
easement of dedication shall conform to the natural drainage
channel. A preserved area no more than three hundred (300)
feet wide may be required where the drainage way carries
water from five hundred (500) or more acres of land.
Minimum vertical elevations for structures, in the form
of vertical building lines, may be required in areas which
are or may become subject to flooding by surface water.
Areas of the subdivision which are subject to inundation from
a 100 year storm shall have delineated on the face of the
plat dashed lines to indicate same.
(g) PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES. Appropriate public
agencies and governing bodies shall be given a sixty day (60)
opportunity to acquire public grounds for schools, parks or
playgrounds shown on any adopted plan which are in whole or
in part in a subdivision.
No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for
subdivision by reason of flooding, bad drainage, adverse
earth or rock formation or topography, or any other feature
likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of the
future residents in the proposed subdivision or of the
community. Such lands shall remain unsubdivided until such
time as the conditions causing the unsuitability are
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-45
corrected.
Natural features such as trees, brooks, hilltops and
views shall be preserved wherever possible.
Parks situated in the interior of blocks shall have
direct public access to surrounding streets, and shall be
covered by maintenance agreements.
(h) COMPLIANCE WITH PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS
(1) All landowners, developers, project owners,
site owners, agencies, businesses, builders,
contractors, or subcontractors (hereafter referred to
as developers) involved in development or construction
activities on any land in the Village shall conduct
said activities in compliance with the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency's current NPDES
(National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System)
Permit regarding construction site activities
(hereafter referred to as the Permit). Furthermore,
developers shall submit to the Village Engineer, at
least 48 hours prior to the commencement of development
or construction activities, two (2) copies of all
notices, plans, and other documentation prepared as
required by the Permit, including the Notice of Intent
(to discharge storm water from construction sites) and
the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan.
(2) Erosion and sediment controls and management
practices implemented within construction sites as
required by the permit shall be at least as protective
as the requirements contained in the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency's current Standards and
Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
(hereafter referred to as the Standards). (Amd. Ord.
53-93 - 10/12/93)
(3) The Permit and the Standards are available for
review at the office of the Village Clerk.
(4) and (5) deleted by Ord 23-07 – 09-17-2007
(i) ROUTING OF CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES.
(1) The developer shall submit to the Village
Engineer or Public Works Director at least 48 hours in
advance of any construction: (1) a proposed routing for
all construction related traffic, which shall include
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-46
the names of all streets of which developers intend to
use to gain access to a subdivided area, (2) the date
on which all construction related traffic will begin to
utilize said construction route, and (3) the date on
which all construction related traffic will cease to
utilize said construction route. All construction
related traffic shall be required to gain access to the
subdivided area by said construction route. The
developer shall be responsible for informing any
contractors or subcontractors working within the
subdivided area the approved construction route. (Ord.
26-96 - 6/1/96)
(j) DEDICATION OF PARK LAND OR PAYMENT OF FEES -
CRITERIA AND FORMULAS
Dedication of Land for Recreation and Open Space or
Payments of Fees in lieu thereof. As a condition of approval
to the recording of a final plat of subdivision or of the
recording of a final plat of a planned unit development, the
Village of Machesney Park shall require land dedicated for
Recreation and Open Space purposes or payment of Fees in lieu
of land, or a combination of both, at the option of the
Village of Machesney Park. (Amd. Ord. 38-04 – 10/25/2004)
(1) Land Requirement and Population Ratio. The
required amount of land to be dedicated for
recreational and open space shall be calculated as
follows:
NOUX 2.5 = TNP
TNP/1000 x 7 acres = TAR
NOU = Number of Units
TNP = Total Number of Persons
TAR = Total Acres Required
(Amd. Ord. 39-04 – 10/18/2004)
Where the Developer cannot satisfactorily show the
specific number of dwelling units to be built, the following
presumptions will apply:
a. Where the property to be developed is zoned
Rural Residential (RR), the presumption is that 2.2
dwelling units per acre will be constructed.
b. Where the property to be developed is zoned
Single-Family Residential (R1), the presumption is that
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-47
1 dwelling unit per lot will be constructed.
c. Where the property to be developed is zoned
Two-Family Residential (R2), the presumption is that 2
dwelling units per lot will be constructed.
d. Where the property to be developed is zoned
Multi-Family Low Density (R3), the presumption is that
12 dwelling units per acre will be constructed.
e. Where the property to be developed is zoned
Multi-Family Medium Density (R4), the presumption is
that 25 dwelling units per acre will be constructed.
(2) Location.
The dedication land shall be located taking into
account the Village Comprehensive Plan and so as to
reasonably serve the recreation and open space needs of
residents of the subdivision or planned unit
development for which the land dedication is made. The
Village Board may require that land be located on the
periphery of the subdivision or planned unit
development in order to allow the enlargement by
combining such areas with recreation and open space
areas serving adjacent property.
(3) Minimum Size.
The minimum size of any site to be dedicated for
recreation and open space purposes shall be no less
than 10,000 Sq. Ft., one dimension of which cannot be
less than 100 feet, except the Plat Committee may
recommend and the Village Board may approve dedications
of a smaller size, when the usefulness of the smaller
area for park and recreational purposes is
demonstrated.
(4) Greenways.
The Plat Committee may recommend and the Village
Board may approve the dedication of land for recreation
and open space purposes in the form of a greenway. If
recreation and open space is to be in the form of a
greenway, the land shall be a continuous linear parcel
through the subdivision of at least 30 feet in width.
(5) Exceptions.
The following land areas shall not be considered
to fulfill the recreation and open space requirement
unless approved by the Village Board.
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-48
a. Detention areas for storm water control shall
not qualify as recreation and open space. If the
Developer can clearly demonstrate the use of the land
area for recreation and open space purposes the Village
Board may consider detention areas for storm water
control in fulfilling the recreation and open space
requirement.
b. Rights-of-way and/or easements shall not
qualify as recreation and open space. If the Developer
can clearly demonstrate the use of the land area for
recreation and open space purposes the Village Board
may consider rights-of-way and/or easements in
fulfilling the recreation and open space requirements.
However, in no event shall detention areas for storm
water control and/or rights-of-way and/or easements exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the total required recreation and open
space dedication.
(6) Access
All dwelling units in the subdivision shall have
free and convenient ingress and egress to the
recreation and open space areas provided within the
development by means of improved streets, recreational
path or public walkways.
(7) Method and Form of Conveyance
All sites for recreation and open space required
pursuant to this Section shall be conveyed by the
Developer to the Village of Machesney Park by
dedication on the Plat or by warranty deed.
(8) Payment of Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication
At the option of the Village of Machesney Park,
the developer may be required to pay a cash fee in lieu
of land dedication. The fee in lieu of land dedication
is hereby established at the amount of $20,000 per acre
of required land dedication.
In the event that a developer is required by the
Village to pay a cash fee in lieu of land dedication and
he/she disagrees with the established fee per acre, he/she
has the following option. At his/her expense, a developer
may contract with an independent party, being a qualified
appraiser, approved by the Village of Machesney Park, to
establish the fee in lieu of land dedication. The appraiser
shall use comparable properties when estimating the value.
Said independent party’s findings on the estimated value of
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-49
the site shall be final and binding on all parties. A
qualified appraiser shall be an Illinois Licensed Real Estate
Appraiser. (Amd. Ord. 38-04 – 10/25/2004)
(9) Combination of Fees and Land Dedication.
The Developer may dedicate a portion of the total
required land area to be dedicated and pay a fee in
lieu of the remaining land area to be dedicated. This
fee is to be determined using the following formula:
TAR - ALD = Z
EVU x Z = Required Fee
TAR = Total Acres Required
ALD = Acre(s) of Land Dedicated
EVU = Estimated Value of Unimproved Land (see
Payment of Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication)
Z = Remaining Land for which a fee is required
(10) Time of Payment of Fees
Fees in lieu of land dedication paid pursuant to
this Section shall be made to the Village of Machesney
Park. The Village of Machesney Park shall receive such
funds prior to the Village Plat Officer signing the
final plat to be recorded.
(11) Use of Fees in Lieu of Dedication
The fees received in lieu of recreation and open
space land dedications shall be held in trust by the
Village solely for the acquisition of recreation and
open space land, which will be available to serve the
immediate or future needs of the residents of that
subdivision or planned unit development, or for the
improvement of any existing local recreation and open
space land that already services such needs.
(12) Refund of Cash Contribution
If any portion of a fee in lieu of recreation and
open space land dedication is not expended for the
purposes set forth herein 10 years from the date of
receipt, it shall be refunded to the Developer who made
such contribution, along with any accrued interest
earned on such funds.
(13) Credit for Private Recreation and Open Space Areas
When Owners or Developers provide their own
recreation and open space areas and facilities, it has
the effect of reducing the demand for local public
recreational and open space areas. Depending on the
size of the development, a portion of the recreation
APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISIONS
B-50
and open space area in subdivisions or planned unit
developments may, at the option of the Village Board,
be provided in the form of "private" recreation and
open space in lieu of dedicated "public" recreation and
open space. The extent of same shall be determined by
the Village Board based upon the needs of the projected
residents and in conformance with the "Standards for
Park and Recreation Open Space" which is incorporated
herein and made a part hereof by reference.
In general, a substitution of private recreation and
open space for dedicated public recreational and open space
requires a substantially higher degree of improvement and the
installation of recreation facilities, including equipment by
the owner of developer as part of his obligation. Detailed
plans of such areas, including specifications of the
facilities to be installed, must be approved by the Village
in accordance with the "Standards for Park and Recreation
Open Space". Before any credit is given for private
recreation and open space areas, the owner or developer must
guarantee that these private recreation and open space areas
will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution
of the appropriate legal documents. When an adjustment for
private recreation and open space areas is warranted, it will
be necessary to compute the total recreation and open space
dedication that would have been required from the subdivision
or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to
be given; provided, however, in no event shall the credit
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total recreation and open
space dedication that would have been required. (Amd. Ord.
