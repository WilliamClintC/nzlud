Article 5C Special Permits
Article 5C, Section 1 Statement of Purpose
Ashford, Connecticut - Zoning Regulations
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
OFFICIAL DRAFT – EFFECTIVE 11/1/2014 57
The purpose of the Special Permit regulations is to provide a comprehensive review of the proposed plan for the layout of the building(s), structure(s) or use(s) in relationship to the topographical, geological and other natural features of the land, and of the impact of the use(s) upon the environment, health, safety, welfare and convenience of the members of the community consistent with the Town Plan of Conservation and Development. It is intended to insure that the design and layout of the site and the proposed use(s) will constitute suitable and appropriate development in character with the neighborhood and will not result in a decrease in property values or a detriment to the present and potential use of the area in which it is to be located. Special Permit procedures are also intended to assure that proposed buildings, structures and uses will provide for the maintenance of air, surface water and groundwater quality and will not be detrimental to existing sources of potable water or other natural or historic resources.
Article 5C, Section 2 When Required
A Special Permit must be issued by the Commission before any person may establish or change any land use, or use, erect, construct, move, enlarge, or alter any building or structure, in whole or in part, if the use, structure or building resulting from such activity is listed as a Special Permitted Use under Article 4 of these regulations for the zone in which it would be located. The issuance of a Special Permit fulfills the requirement for the issuance of a Zoning Permit.
Article 5C, Section 3 Standards for Special Permits
All buildings, structures and uses for which a Special Permit is required under these regulations must meet the applicable standards set forth throughout these regulations including, but not limited to, the following standards:
1. Preservation of Landscape: The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state insofar as practicable by minimizing grading and the removal of vegetation and soil. Where vegetative cover does not exist or has been removed, new plantings may be required. Finished site contours shall depart only minimally from the character of the natural site and the surrounding properties.
2. Relation of Buildings to Environment: The proposed project or development shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and to the use, scale and siting of existing buildings in the vicinity of the site. All buildings and other structures shall be sited to minimize disruption of the topography. Strict attention shall be given to the proper functional, visual and spatial relationships of all structures, buildings, landscaped elements and paved areas.
3. Landscaped Buffer Areas: All buffered and/or screened areas, including setback areas (landscaped and usable), shall be so designed as to be consistent and compatible with abutting uses.
4. Circulation: With respect to vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including entrances, ramps, walkways, drives and parking, special attention shall be given to location and number of access points to the public streets, width of interior drives and access points, general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, access to community or public facilities, and arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient and, insofar as practicable, do not detract from the use and enjoyment of proposed buildings and structures and the neighboring properties.
5. Surface Water Drainage: Special attention shall be given to proper surface drainage so that surface waters will not adversely affect neighboring properties or public storm drainage facilities, will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic, and will not create standing water, in paved or pedestrian areas. All surface water drained from roofs, streets, parking lots and other impervious areas shall be disposed of in a safe and efficient manner that will not create problems of water runoff or erosion on the site or on neighboring sites or pollution of surface water or groundwater. Insofar as possible, natural drainage courses and swales shall be properly stabilized and drainage-impounding-areas shall be utilized to dispose of water on the site through natural percolation to a degree equivalent to that prior to development. Also, appropriate erosion control measures shall be employed, including slope stabilization measures and the seeding of exposed areas to replace vegetative cover.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
OFFICIAL DRAFT – EFFECTIVE 11/1/2014 58
6. Groundwater Recharge and Quality Preservation: Ground water recharge shall be maximized and ground water quality shall be protected. Various techniques may be required to maximize recharge, such as perforated drainpipes, pervious pavement, reduction of structure area, or reduction of lot coverage. Where groundwater elevations are close to the surface, extra site grading precautions may be required to maintain the protective function of the overburden.
7. Utilities: The placement of electric, telephone, or other utility lines and equipment shall be underground. Such utilities shall be so located as to provide no adverse impact on groundwater levels, and coordinated with other utilities.
8. Other Site Features: Exposed storage or utility areas, exposed machinery installations, and service areas shall be designed with screen plantings, fencing or other screening methods to be compatible with the environment and the surrounding properties.
9. Safety: All open and enclosed spaces shall be designed to facilitate evacuation and to maximize accessibility by fire, police and other emergency personnel and equipment.
10. Neighboring Properties: The proposed use shall be of such location, size and character that, in general, it will be in harmony with the appropriate orderly development of the zone in which it is proposed to be situated and will not be detrimental to the orderly development of adjacent properties.
11. Natural, Agricultural and Historical Resources: The proposed uses shall not unreasonably destroy, damage or threaten locally significant natural or historical resources.

Article 6C - Outdoor Lighting
Article 6C, Section 1 Purpose
To require and set minimum standards for outdoor lighting to:
1. Provide for and control lighting in outdoor public places for public health, safety and welfare;
2. Protect drivers and pedestrians from the glare of non-vehicular light sources;
3. Protect neighbors, the environment and the night sky from nuisance glare and light trespass from improperly selected, placed, aimed, applied, maintained or shielded light sources;
4. Encourage quality lighting design, light luminaire shielding, uniform light intensities, maximum lighting levels within and on property lines, and lighting controls;
5. Promote energy efficient lighting design and operation;
6. Protect and retain the intended visual character of the town; and
7. Provide an environmentally sensitive nighttime environment that protects significant wildlife habitat.
Article 6C, Section 2 Applicability
A. Outdoor lighting (For the purposes of these provisions, light sources include any refractor, reflector, bulb, tube, or globe) shall be kept to the minimum intensity needed for ground and entryway lighting. No exterior lighting shall be used in a manner which produces a bloom or a direct glare on neighboring property or adjacent street, or which produces an objectionable visual disturbance. All exterior lighting shall be shielded so that the source of light cannot be directly seen from off the property. All outdoor lighting facilities or lamps shall be shielded in such a manner that:
1. the edge of the lamp shield is below the light source;
2. direct radiation (glare) from the light source is confined within the boundaries of the property; and
3. direct radiation is prevented from escaping toward the sky.
B. The mounting height of a lighting fixture shall be defined as the vertical distance from the grade elevation directly below the fixture to the bottom of the lighting fixture. The height shall be the minimum necessary to illuminate the project area, and in no case shall exceed sixteen feet (16) for parking lot lighting.
C. Temporary seasonal decorative lighting is exempt from the requirements of this Regulation.
Article 6C, Section 3 Standards
A. All lighting shall be aimed, located, designed, fitted and maintained so as not to present a hazard to drivers or pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely traverse and so as not to create a nuisance by projecting or reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or property.
B. Directional Lighting units such as floodlights and spotlights, when their use is specifically approved by the Commission, shall be so shielded, installed and aimed that they do not project their output onto the properties of neighboring residences, adjacent uses, past the object being illuminated, skyward or onto a public roadway or pedestrian way. Floodlights installed above grade on residential properties, except when motion-sensor actuated,
Ashford, Connecticut - Zoning Regulations
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
OFFICIAL DRAFT – EFFECTIVE 11/1/2014 72
shall not be aimed out more than 45º from straight down. When a floodlight creates glare as viewed from an adjacent residential property, the floodlight shall be required to be re-aimed and/or fitted with a shielding device to block the view of the glare source from that property.
C. Parking facility and vehicular and pedestrian-way lighting (except for safety and security applications and all-night business operations), for commercial, industrial and institutional uses shall be automatically extinguished no later than one-half hour after the close of business or facility operation. When safety or security lighting is proposed for after-hours illumination, it shall not be in excess of twenty-five (25) percent of the number of lighting units or illumination level required or permitted for illumination during regular business hours.
D. For premises containing commercial, industrial or institutional establishments, illumination for signs, building facades and/or surrounding landscapes for decorative, advertising or aesthetic purposes is prohibited between 11:00 p.m. and dawn, or one-half hour after the close of business and dawn, whichever is later.
E. Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the primary means for controlling glare. Rather, glare control shall be achieved primarily through the use of such means as cutoff lighting units, shields and baffles, and appropriate application of luminaire mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and luminaire placement.
F. Only the United States and the state flag shall be permitted to be illuminated from dusk till dawn. All other flags shall not be illuminated past 11:00 p.m.
Article 6C, Section 4 Nonconforming lighting; Modifications

As a condition of the approval of any Zoning Permit, the Commission shall require that the record owners of the subject property post a performance bond with the Town in an amount necessary to cover one hundred percent (100%) of the actual costs to complete construction of any site improvements that will be conveyed to or controlled by the Town and the implementation of any erosion control measures required during construction activities, plus a contingency amount of ten percent (10%) of such costs.
Prior to posting the bond, the party posting the bond shall submit to the Commission an estimate of the costs necessary to complete the items being bonded. Within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Town Engineer shall review the estimate and advise the Commission of the amount of security recommended. Once posted, the amount of the bond may be reviewed periodically and adjusted by the Commission to account, if necessary, for inflation or any unanticipated increases in the cost of completion.
Article 6K, Section 3 Performance Bond for Special Permit
As a condition of the approval of any Special Permit, in addition to bonding for the items set forth in Section 2 above, the Commission shall require that the record owners of the subject property post a performance bond with the Town in an amount necessary to cover one hundred percent (100%) of the actual costs to complete construction or implementation of any private site improvements, inspections and/or maintenance required by the Commission in connection with its approval, plus a contingency amount of ten percent (10%) of such costs. Private site improvements may include but are not limited to drainage, septic facilities, landscaping, lighting, walkways and reclamation of property upon completion of the permitted activity.

1. Appeals. The ZBA shall have the authority to hear and decide upon any appeal where it is alleged that there is an error in the order, requirements, decision or determination of the Zoning Enforcement Officer. No question of hardship shall be involved in such an appeal, and the action of the ZBA thereon shall be limited to the question of whether or not, and to what extent, such order, requirement, decision or determination was a correct interpretation of the subject provision of these regulations.
2. Variances. The ZBA shall have the authority to vary or adjust the strict application of these regulations in only those cases where the unusual size, shape or topography of a lot or other unusual physical conditions pertaining to it or to any building situated thereon make it impossible to strictly apply a specific provision of these regulations to such lot without resulting in exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship, so that substantial justice shall be done and the public health, safety and welfare secured.
3. Location of motor vehicle uses. The ZBA shall have the authority to hear and decide upon all requests for certificates of approval for motor vehicle sales, services and repair uses in accordance with Sec. 14 -54 of the General Statutes. In this function the ZBA is acting as the local authority of the Department of Motor Vehicles and not in a zoning capacity; the DMV recognizes no conditions on such certificates of approval. Such authority shall not supersede the Commission's authority to hear and decide upon requests for, or impose conditions on special permits for such uses.
4. Use variances. No use variance shall be granted by the ZBA that would permit:
a. A use prohibited either implicitly or explicitly by these regulations.
b. The expansion of a nonconforming use.
c. A use otherwise allowed by special permit in the district in which the use is located.
Prior to a public hearing on any application for a use variance, the ZBA shall transmit the application to the Commission for its review and comment. Any report submitted by the Commission to the ZBA shall be read into the record of the public hearing of the subject application.
Article 7, Section 2 General Rules

OFFICIAL DRAFT – EFFECTIVE 11/1/2014 102
C. Referrals. To assist with its consideration of an appeal or application, the ZBA may refer such appeal or application to any department, agency or official it deems appropriate to review and comment upon those technical matters which are the concern or responsibility of such department, agency or official.
D. Public hearing. The ZBA shall hold a public hearing on all appeals and applications for variances shall decide thereon and shall give notice of its decision in accordance with the provisions of the General Statutes.
E. No variance shall be granted by the ZBA unless it finds:
1. That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in the findings of the ZBA, applying to the lot or structure for which the variance is sought which are peculiar to such lot or structure and do not apply generally to lots or structures in the neighborhood and which have not resulted from any willful act of the applicant subsequent to the date of adoption of the regulation from which the variance is sought, whether in violation of the provisions herein or not;
2. That, for reasons fully set forth in the findings of the ZBA, the aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the particular application of the provisions of these regulations would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the lot or structure, that the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the lot or structure and that the variance as granted by the ZBA is the minimum adjustment necessary to accomplish this purpose;
3. That the granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of these regulations and the town's Plan of Development and shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare; and
4. That the granting of the variance is not based upon the nonconformity of neighboring lots, uses, buildings or structures nor upon a financial or economic hardship.
F. Whenever the ZBA grants a variance, it shall include in its minutes as part of the record the reason for its decision, the specific provision of these regulations that were varied, the extent of the variance and the specific hardship upon which its decision was based.
G. In exercising any of its authority, the ZBA may attach any conditions and safeguards as may be required to protect the public health, safety and general welfare and to ensure ongoing compliance with these regulations. Violation of such conditions and safeguards shall be deemed to be a violation of these regulations.
H. Any variance granted by the ZBA shall become effective upon its filing by the applicant in the office of the Town.
I. Any variance granted by the ZBA that is not recorded within one (1) year from its effective date shall be null and void.
J. If the ZBA denies a variance, it shall not be required to hear an application for the same variance or substantially the same variance for a period of six (6) months after the date of denial, unless the circumstances associated with the application have substantially changed. A change in ownership of property or any interests therein shall not be deemed a substantial change.
K. No appeal or variance shall be granted that would alter, revise or otherwise change any of the conditions attached to the granting of a special permit by the Commission, if such conditions are more restrictive than otherwise provided for in these regulations or if such conditions do not refer to specified standards in these regulations.

Chapter I Purpose Section A Statutory Authority These regulations have been prepared and adopted pursuant to the authority granted in Chapter 126 of the Connecticut General Statutes of the State of Connecticut, hereinafter referred to as CGS. Section B Policy It is the policy of the Ashford Planning and Zoning Commission to consider land subdivision as part of a plan for the orderly, efficient and coordinated growth so as to further the general welfare and well being of its people. The planning and Zoning Commission through the application of standards and conditions set forth in these Regulations, the Ashford Zoning Regulations, the Ashford Public Improvement Specifications and the Plan of Conservation and Development shall determine whether to approve, modify and approve, or deny any subdivision or re-subdivision application after applying such standards and conditions to reasonably protect the rights of individuals, property values, public health, public safety and public welfare. Section C Purpose The Town of Ashford, through its Planning and Zoning Commission, shall enforce these subdivision regulations to maintain the rural character of the town in keeping with the public expression as determined through the Plan of Conservation and Development process; and will establish appropriate standards for the design and implementation of subdivisions, the construction of streets and other improvements, and has adopted these Regulations to accomplish the following: 1. Provide that the land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to public health or safety and not result in soil, water or air pollution, excessive noise, or other menace. 2. Provide that proper provisions are made for water supply, sewage disposal, fire protection and other appropriate utility services and drainage; including the upgrading of any downstream ditch, culvert or other drainage structure which, through the introduction of additional drainage due to such subdivision, becomes undersized and creates the potential for down drainage flooding.
Town of Ashford

3. Provide that proper provisions are made for the prevention of flooding through flood control protective measures in areas contiguous to brooks, rivers or other bodies of water. Land subject to flooding shall not be put to any use that will aggravate flood hazard conditions. 4. Ensure that proposed streets are built to the Ashford Public Improvement Specifications and are in harmony with existing or proposed principal thoroughfares shown on the Plan of Conservation and Development, as per CGS Section 8-23. This is especially important to maintain safe intersections with such thoroughfares, and provide that such streets be arranged and of such width to provide an adequate and convenient system for present and prospective traffic needs. 5. Provide for the creation of open spaces and parks when, and in places, deemed appropriate and proper by the commission. 6. Provide that proper provisions are made for soil erosion and sediment control in accordance with CGS Section 22a-329. 7. Provide that solar access and passive solar energy techniques are considered and included in the design of any new subdivision. Require applicants for subdivision or resubdivision approval to demonstrate to the Commission they have incorporated solar access and passive solar energy techniques in the design of the subdivision. See Chapter IV, Section I. 8. Encourage energy-efficient patterns of development and land use, the use of solar and other renewable forms of energy, and energy conservation. 9. Provide for the protection of State and Federally Listed Species and Significant Natural Communities; Prime Farmland and Farmland of Additional Statewide Importance; and high yielding and potentially high yielding aquifers. 10. Encourage protection of the rural character of Ashford by maintaining existing stone walls, historical features, scenic views, walking paths, tree lined streets, open fields, and active agriculture. Section D Jurisdiction These Regulations shall apply to the subdivision and resubdivision of land, as herein defined, located within the corporate limits of the Town of Ashford, Connecticut. No subdivision or resubdivision of land shall be made by any person, firm, or corporation until an application for such subdivision or resubdivision has been submitted to and approved by the Town Planning and Zoning Commission, and a map thereof has been endorsed by the Commission and filed by the applicant in the Office of the Ashford Town Clerk. Section E Interpretation In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these Regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare.

Section F Procedure The Commission, in reviewing any proposed subdivision or resubdivision, and the person proposing a subdivision or resubdivision, shall follow the procedures hereinafter specified. The Commission shall not approve any subdivision or resubdivision unless it conforms to the standards hereinafter specified or to such other standards approved by the Commission pursuant to these Regulations. Section G Conflict These Regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulations, statute or provision of law. Where any provision of these Regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other provisions of these Regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control.

After said subdivision or resubdivision has been approved and/or recorded, the subject tract shall not be further divided into one or more building lots without the prior resubdivision approval of this Commission.
3. Before a subdivision or resubdivision is made the applicant should become familiar with these regulations and those related to such as contained in the Town Zoning and Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations.
4. Subdivisions may be developed, upon approval, in a conventional form or open space form form of subdivision. Section B Preliminary Plan and Review
1. Pre-Application Conference: An applicant should review with the Town Land Use Staff (Building Department) in a preliminary and informal manner any proposal for subdivision or resubdivision prior to submission of a preliminary and/or formal application.
a. The purpose for using the preliminary procedure is to look in more detail at the proposal and provide guidance to the subdivider to identify areas of concern or further study, so as to minimize delay, expense and inconvenience to the public, the applicant, and the Commission upon the future receipt, if any, of a formal application for subdivision.
Town of Ashford
15
b. During informal discussions, the applicant may submit or the Town Staff may request such information, plans, and maps as may lead to non-binding recommendations.
2. Recommended Preliminary Layout Procedure: The Commission strongly recommends any proposed subdivision or re-subdivision of three (3) or more lots to follow the Preliminary Procedure.
3. Presentation of the preliminary plan shall not constitute "formal" application within the meaning of Title 8, Chapter 126, of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended and the Commission's review of said preliminary plan and its comments, if any, shall not be deemed to be the official "action" or "decision" within the meaning of said Title and Chapter.
4. The Preliminary Layout design shall include a rendition of a Conventional Subdivision Design, for all proposed subdivisions, as well as an Open Space Subdivision design, if six (6) lots or more are proposed. The submission of both designs will allow the Commission to recommend which design best suits the property and recommend which design should be presented in the Formal Subdivision Application.

Section C Preliminary Layout Specifications for Application Drawings 1. The applicant shall provide a preliminary plan conforming to the Ashford Zoning and Subdivision Regulations and the Ashford Road Ordinance.
2. The preliminary plan shall show existing conditions, the proposed road, and lot layout of the subdivision. The preliminary plan shall show at least the following information, with the understanding that more detailed preliminary plan discussions could result in minor to substantial changes in the plan. The preliminary plan should encompass the overall tract, even if only part is being proposed for subdivision. The submission of a preliminary plan does not alter the requirements and procedures of a final plan. The Preliminary Plan of a proposed subdivision or resubdivision should be presented in a legible format, and show:
a. The subdivision or resubdivision name, boundaries, north point, date (word and graphic), assessor’s map, block and lot number of the original parcel, scale, legend and title ”Preliminary plan;”

Chapter IV Formal Subdivision Plan Proposal:
Conditions, Required Submittals, Procedures, Specifications, Plan Profiles and Other Requirements
Section A Formal Subdivision Plan – Conditions
The following are conditions for designing, submitting and implementing all subdivision or resubdivisions proposals.
1. Responsibility: If an applicant wishes to subdivide or re-subdivide land in the Town of Ashford it is the applicant’s responsibility to submit a complete application with both a Conventional Subdivision Plan design and an Open Space Plan design, if six (6) or more lots are proposed. Such plan(s) shall demonstrate compliance with all criteria and requirements of these Regulations and the Ashford Zoning Regulations and, accordingly, the applicant shall submit such additional reports or information as may be required to satisfy that responsibility. It is highly recommended a Pre-Application Conference with the Commission be undertaken and then the Preliminary Layout procedure be followed. (See Chapter III). This approach may be favorable because the Commission shall, in that process, make a recommendation as to which design, Conventional Subdivision Plan design or an Open Space Subdivision Plan design, the applicant should submit.
Required open space shall ordinarily be a minimum of twenty (20%) percent of the property under consideration for a Conventional Subdivision Plan and fifty (50%) percent for an Open Space Subdivision Plan. Any application found to be incomplete in any submittal requirement shall be denied by the Commission without prejudice to a future complete application.
2. The Subdivision Plan Approval and Sale of Lots: All plans for the subdivision or re-subdivision of land must be submitted to the Commission for approval. No Certificate of Zoning Compliance (Zoning Permit) shall be issued for any use, nor any building permit for the erection or enlargement of any building shall be granted without the prior approval of the subdivision or re-subdivision plan; or any amendment thereof, by the Commission, and the filing of the endorsed Final Subdivision Plan in the Office of the Town Clerk. No lot proposed in a subdivision or resubdivision of any tract or parcel of land shall be sold or offered for sale or used for any building development without the Commission’s approval of the Final Subdivision Plan.
3. Penalties: Any person, firm, corporation, partnership or association making the subdivision
Town of Ashford
18
or re-subdivision of land without approval of the Commission shall be liable to a fine of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) for each lot sold or offered for sale. In the event that any subdivider, contractor or person in the employ or acting on the behalf of the subdivider violates these regulations, or the conditions or requirements of any subdivision approved hereunder, the Commission may, following a public hearing with notice by certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or in part, any such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Ashford Land Records. Any person, firm, corporation, partnership or association not paying such penalty within thirty (30) days of notification of the assessment of such penalty shall not retain the privilege of representing any future land development project before the Commission until such penalty, plus current monthly interest charges, are paid to the Town Clerk. Any subdivider or re-subdivider with any existing Planning and/or Zoning violation(s) on any parcel of property in the Town of Ashford; where that person, firm, corporation, partnership or association owns an interest; may not apply for any new applications until all violations are corrected.
4. Streets: In the case of subdivisions requiring new streets, the applicant shall construct all new streets to meet the established Town of Ashford standards defined in Public Improvement Specifications and all design requirements of Chapter VIII of these Regulations. Any new street that provides access to new lots shall be required to meet the Public Improvement Specification.
5. Home Owners’ Association: All Loop Streets and Cul-de-sac Streets shall be owned and maintained by an approved Home Owners’ Association meeting the criteria of Chapter V, Section I.

Chapter V Open Space
Section A Disposition For any subdivision or re-subdivision of land under these Regulations, the Commission shall require of the applicant/subdivider the conveyance and official dedication of appropriately located and sized “open space”. Open Space should compliment good subdivision design and not be used to designate land that does not have the capability of being developed in a sound and sustainable manner due to proposed design or limiting natural features.
1. The identification and selection of open space area(s) within the proposed subdivision shall be discussed at the Pre-Application Conference (Preliminary Layout which is recommended) or determined at the Formal Subdivision Plan Application phase. The Commission reserves the right to select that portion of the proposed subdivision to be dedicated for open space and it may reject or modify any area that may be proposed by the applicant and require an alternative, as provided under these regulations.
2. In determining the appropriateness of an open space disposition, the Commission shall consider the objectives and goals of the most recent Plan of Conservation and Development, the most recent Open Space Plan and any other Town, State or regional plan(s).
3. The Commission shall assess and select open space land when one or more of the following criteria are met:
a. The land under consideration shall be worthy of conservation and capable of long-term protection by the parties in receipt of the dedication.
b. Protects and/or provides a buffer or linkage to already protected lands.
c. Extends existing protected land.
d. Adds to an existing trail corridor, completes a trail link, or initiates or adds to a walking trail.
e. Protects or adds to a large un-fragmented parcel of farm, forest, or wildlife habitat.
f. Represents a “keystone property” that abuts or links land that has the potential for conservation.
g. Protects waterways, lake-frontage, public water supply watershed and/or a wildlife habitat corridor.
Town of Ashford
34
h. Provides opportunities for active and passive public recreation such as fishing, hunting, walking, cross-country skiing, bird watching, photography, nature observation, hiking etc.
i. Protects habitat areas of threatened or endangered species and /or areas of known productive wildlife habitats and/or corridors.
j. Protects locally important or unique geographical features; trees and other flora, ridges, ridge lines, ravines, scenic views, historic or archeological sites, unpaved roads, stone walls, and other natural and manmade features that maintain and exemplify the rural character of Ashford.
4. The applicant/subdivider shall provide a Documentation Report of Base Line Data which shall include reports, maps, photographs, drawings and other documentation depicting the boundaries and existing condition of the Open Space Land to be dedicated. Such Documentation Report shall be completed and made part of the Final and Formal Subdivision Plan prior to any Commission action on the proposed subdivision application. This Report is particularly important in the case of any dedicated easement(s) the Town or other party(s) may receive for monitoring and enforcing against future encroachment or disturbance to the Open Space.
5. The Commission reserves the right to enter the proposed Open Space Land to verify the contents of the Documentation Report of Base Line Data as submitted prior to any action by the Commission on the Final Subdivision Plan Application.
Section B Size
Open space dedication shall be deemed appropriate for all subdivisions or re-subdivisions of land when three (3) or more lots are proposed for subdivision. The required open space areas shall be determined by the Commission based on the site's value and importance in meeting the objectives cited in Chapter V, Section A and the scope of the subdivision proposal. Required open space land shall ordinarily be a minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the area of the property under consideration for a Conventional Subdivision Plan and be fifty percent (50%) of the total parcel(s) area proposed in an Open Space Subdivision Plan. In determining total land to be reserved as open space, the Commission may consider the tract or tracts of land to be immediately subdivided. Areas to be reserved as open space shall be shown on the Final Subdivision Plan.
Section C Sites of Archaeological Significance
1. All applicants shall make written inquiry of the office of State Archaeologist to determine if there is existing evidence, or a reason to believe evidence exists, of sites of archaeological significance within the proposed subdivision or resubdivision. Such inquiry shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested. Proof of such mailing shall be provided to the Commission at the time of submitting the subdivision application. Any significant sites shall be left undisturbed and may be considered in meeting the minimum open space requirements of this Chapter. If no reply from the State Archaeologist is received within 30 days after receipt of the written inquiry, it shall be
Town of Ashford
35
presumed that the State Archaeologist has determined that the proposed subdivision or resubdivision is not located within an area of archaeological significance. All requirements of the applicable provisions of the Ashford Zoning Regulations shall apply.
2. The Commission may require an environmental assessment where it determines that the subdivision may contain significant natural and/or cultural resources, based on the National Resources Inventory, Conservation Commission, Open Space Report, Plan of Conservation and Development, State Archaeologist’s report, or other pertinent information reviewed by the Commission.
Section D Method of Dedication
The Commission shall review the most appropriate method of disposition after considering, among other things, the relationship of the subject area(s) and its specific characteristics to the Plan of Conservation and Development and the objectives cited in Chapter V, Section A; the desirability and suitability of public access and use and the scope of the subdivision proposal. Any conservation easements or other open space covenants or restrictions shall be subject to the approval of the Commission in form and content. The following disposition options may be utilized by the Commission:
1. Conveyed in fee simple to the Town.
2. Conveyed in fee simple to the State of Connecticut for open space, provided the State of Connecticut has agreed to accept the dedication.
3. Conveyed in fee simple to a land trust (at the option of the subdivider), as long as the land trust has agreed to accept the dedication.
4. Dedication in fee simple to a homeowners' association for open space purposes (see Chapter V, Section I).
5. Utilization of conservation easement(s), with or without public access, using the form set forth in Appendix G.
6. Utilization of an agricultural use restriction easement, to the Town, State, or a private non-profit entity.
7. Private ownership for open space purposes with the appropriate conveyance of development rights.
8. Any combination of the above or any suitable alternative approved by the Commission.
Section E Fee In Lieu of Open Space
As set forth in CGS Section 8-25, the Commission may authorize the applicant to pay a fee to the Town, or pay a fee to the Town and transfer land to the Town in lieu of the full requirement to provide open space as set forth above. Such authorization may be granted by the Commission if and when it determines, in its sole discretion, that conditions such as subdivision size, population
Town of Ashford
36
densities, existing open space in the neighborhood, topography, soils, or other characteristics are such that on-site open space is not as desirable as a fee-in-lieu of open space.
1. Amount: Such fee or combination of fee and the fair market of land transferred shall be equal to not more than ten percent (10%) of the fair market value of the land to be subdivided prior to the approval of the subdivision. The fair market value of such land shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the Commission and the applicant, with the cost of all appraisal fees and expenses borne by the applicant.
2. Procedure: To employ the fee-in-lieu of open space option, the following procedures shall be used:
a. The applicant shall submit to the Commission a written proposal to pay a fee or transfer land to the Town in lieu of providing open space.
b. The Commission shall determine whether it is willing to consider the applicant’s proposal further, or whether it would be willing to consider a different combination of land transfer and fee. The Commission’s determination at this stage shall not be binding on either the Commission or the applicant.
c. If the Commission and applicant agree on further consideration of a fee, transfer of land, or both, they shall jointly select an appraiser to submit a report.
Steps a) through c) may be accomplished as part of the consideration of a Preliminary Layout, or at the time of acceptance of a Formal Subdivision application.
d. The applicant shall submit the appraisal prior to the completion of the Commission’s review of the Formal Subdivision application. If the Commission holds a public hearing on the application, the applicant must submit the appraisal before the close of the public hearing.
e. The Commission, as part of the action on the application, may either accept the fee-in-lieu proposal or a combination of fee and land transfer proposal, or it may require an open space dedication.
3. Payment: The method of payment of any fees under this Section shall be one of the following two options:
a. The applicant, at his option, may submit the entire fee in one lump sum prior to the filing of the approved Final Subdivision mylars with the Town Clerk; or,
b. The applicant may elect to submit a fraction of such payment, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of approved building lots in the subdivision, no later than the time of the sale of each approved building lot; and a notation describing this requirement shall be placed on the Final Subdivision map filed in the Town Clerk’s office. If this option is chosen, the applicant shall submit a bond or other security acceptable to the Town, equal to the full amount of fee required, prior to the filing of the subdivision maps in the Town Clerk’s office. Any required fees shall be
Town of Ashford
37
paid to the Town prior to the release of this bond. The Commission may also choose other acceptable security such as a mortgage or lien on the land to be subdivided. This mortgage or lien shall secure the amount of the fee-in-lieu and provide for partial release of lots sold as the fractional part of the fee is paid.
4. Building Permits: No building permits shall be issued until such fractional part payments are paid as to any lot sold in the subdivision.
5. Dedicated Fund: Fees submitted under this section shall be deposited by the Town in a fund which shall be used for the purpose of preserving open space or acquiring additional land for open space.
Section F Referrals
The Commission may refer for review and comment any subdivision plan and proposal for the provision of open spaces to the Conservation Commission, Soil and Water Conservation District, or any other appropriate agency.
Section G Condition of Open Spaces
1. Land to be provided as open space shall be left in a natural state by the applicant/subdivider/developer unless otherwise specified by the Commission. Except for such improvements as may be required by the Commission, open space areas shall not be graded, cleared or used as a parking or temporary storage area during any construction process; used as a repository for brush, stumps, earth, building materials or debris nor shall earth materials be mined or removed.
2. Open space areas shall typically abut or have direct public access to a public street and, as appropriate, any existing park or public land. The Commission may require access areas to be graded and improved in a manner suitable for safe pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic. Access roadways shall conform to Town specifications for a two (2) house driveway, See also Ashford Zoning Regulations.
3. When site improvements are required, they shall be clearly shown on the Subdivision Plan Maps and they shall be approved by the Commission prior to the filing of the Final Subdivision Plan.
4. The boundary lines of all areas to be dedicated shall be set in the field and marked by monuments and Commission-approved plaques where such lines intersect any lot line, road, or perimeter line within the proposed subdivision, and at such other points as may be required by the Commission to ensure identification in the field. All monuments shall be topped with a capital “A”, (designation for Ashford), and meet the requirements of the Ashford Public Improvement Specifications.
Town of Ashford
38
Section H Enforcement Bonding
To ensure proper construction of any required improvements in areas to be dedicated pursuant to this Chapter V, the Commission shall require the subdivider to include in the performance bond an amount sufficient to ensure completion of such improvements. All required improvements of open space land shall be completed prior to the issuance of any building permits.
Section I Homeowners' Association
The Commission may, upon the request of the subdivider, permit the ownership and maintenance of the open space to be transferred to an association of property owners. The document providing for such transfer must:
1. Establish a mandatory participation in an association of property owners to maintain the land reservation for open space with power to assess all members for all necessary costs.
2. Be binding on all future property owners.
3. Be perpetual.
4. Not be affected by any change in zoning or land use.
5. Assure adequate maintenance.
6. Provide for enforcement by the Town by appropriate legal action.
7. Provide that if maintenance or preservation of the dedication no longer comply with the provisions of the document, the Town may take all necessary action to assure compliance and assess against the association all costs incurred by the Town for such purposes.
8. Comply with the Connecticut Common Interest Ownership Act (CIOA) and other relevant state laws and regulations.
After approval by the Town Attorney and Commission, the document shall be filed by the subdivider in the Office of the Town Clerk simultaneously with the endorsed Final Subdivision Plan.
Section J Legal Transfer
Properly executed legal documents, including warranty deeds for any title transfer to the Town of Ashford, shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter V and shall be submitted in triplicate with the final subdivision map to be filed. All documents must be acceptable to the Town Attorney and Zoning Enforcement Officer and shall refer to the subdivision maps by title. All warranty deeds for dedication of land to the Town shall be held in escrow by the Commission to be recorded on the Town Land Records upon acceptance by the
Town of Ashford
39
Town Meeting. In the event that acceptance is rejected by the Town Meeting, the deed shall be returned and the subdivider shall return to the Commission for determination of an alternative means of preserving the open space areas. In no case shall the acceptance of any deed by the Commission or an employee of the Town prior to a Town Meeting approval be deemed as acceptance of the open space by the Town.
Section K Dedication for Other Municipal Purposes
In the event the subdivider proposes to transfer to the Town land for municipal purposes other than open space, the Commission may, in its discretion, approve such dedication as a credit toward any open space disposition requirements under this Chapter.
Section L Open Space Exemptions
In accordance with CGS Section 8-25, the following instances shall be exempt from the provisions of this Chapter V:
1. Where the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five (5) lots is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, or first cousin of the property owner for no consideration. Such intended transfer shall be evidenced by covenants, restrictions, contracts, or other legally binding documents as the Commission may approve, which documents will be filed in the Land Records along with the Final Subdivision Plan. If the Commission determines subsequent to the approval of such subdivision, that such transfers were intended to be temporary and for the sole purpose of evading the requirements of this Section, the Commission may, following a public hearing with notice by certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or in part, any such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Land Records; and
2. Where the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, as defined in CGS Section 8-39a,as amended and as covered in these Regulations. Such restrictions for affordable housing shall be evidenced by such documents as the Commission may require, and such restrictions shall run with the lots affected thereby in perpetuity. If, subsequent to approval of the Subdivision, the lots designated for affordable housing shall not be sold for that purpose, the Commission may, following a public hearing with notice by certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or in part, any such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Land Records.

Chapter VI Open Space Subdivision - Plan Proposal
Section A Purpose The purpose of this Chapter VI is to provide design standards to: (1) maintain and enhance the conservation of natural and scenic resources; (2) protect natural streams and water supplies; (3) promote conservation of soils, wetlands, and other significant natural features and landmarks; (4) provide the opportunity to create large blocks of open spaces; (5) enhance the value to the public of abutting or neighboring parks, forests, wildlife preserves, nature reservations or sanctuaries or other open spaces; (6) preserve historic sites; and (7) promote orderly development. These regulations are intended to provide for increased flexibility, balanced by increased control, in the development of land to facilitate the preservation of open space, natural resources, and community character.
Section B General
The number of lots allowed under an Open Space Subdivision design proposing less than ten (10) lots, shall be the same number that would be allowed by the Commission in the development of the Conventional Subdivision design. For Open Space Subdivision plans proposing ten (10) or more lots, the lot yield may be increased by ten (10%) percent, provided all other requirements under this Chapter and these Subdivision Regulations are met. An “Open Space Subdivision” is a cluster development, as defined by CGS Section 8-18, in which the dimensions that would otherwise be required for lots under the Ashford Zoning Regulations and Ashford Subdivision Regulations may be reduced for the purposes of encouraging the dedication and preservation of additional open space. Specifically, an Open Space Subdivision is a subdivision or re-subdivision of land into lots for single family detached dwelling units that meets the frontage and minimum one (1) acre contiguous buildable land requirements of the Ashford Zoning Regulations. Interior lots are prohibited.
The minimum area of open space to be dedicated within an Open Space Subdivision shall be fifty percent (50%) of the total area of the parcel being subdivided. In addition, the area of open space to be dedicated must contain at least fifty percent (50%) of the total area of the parcel that does not comprise wetlands, watercourses or floodplain areas. As an example, if a parcel containing 100 acres is subdivided, and 30 acres of the parcel consists of wetlands, watercourses, or flood plain areas, the minimum open space dedication will be 50 acres (100 acres x .50), and at least 35 acres (70 acres x .50) of the dedicated area must not be wetlands, watercourses or flood plain areas. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a subdivider from dedicating additional land consisting of wetlands, watercourses or flood plain areas, so long as the minimum amount of other types of land is also provided. For instance, in the example given above, the subdivider could dedicate 30 acres (not just 15 acres) of wetlands, so long as the dedication also included the minimum 35 acres of land that did not consist of wetlands, watercourses or floodplain areas. The Commission encourages subdividers to dedicate or otherwise preserve as much of the wetlands, watercourses and floodplain areas as possible.
Town of Ashford
41
Section C Requirements for Submitting a Formal Open Space Subdivision Plan
1. An applicant shall submit a Conventional Subdivision Plan that conforms to all requirements of the Conventional Subdivision Regulations and the Ashford Zoning Regulations. In addition, except as otherwise provided in Chapter VI, Section H, Exceptions, every applicant proposing to subdivide or re-subdivide a parcel of land containing six (6) or more lots in any zoning district allowing residential development shall submit an Open Space Subdivision Plan that meets the requirements of this Chapter and the other relevant provisions of these Regulations and the Ashford Zoning Regulations. All Preliminary Layout and Formal Subdivision specifications for submittal of a Conventional Subdivision Plan, as defined in Chapters III and IV apply to Open Space Subdivision Plans, as appropriate. In the case of a re-subdivision the Commission may give consideration for any previous open space conveyances. For purposes of determining the size of the parcel proposed for subdivision all land within the parcel, including any land not immediately proposed for use as building lots, shall be included.
2. The Commission recommends that prior to the submission of an official application for Formal Open Space Subdivision approval, the applicant initiate a Pre-Application Conference with the Commission and subsequently prepare and present Preliminary Layout Plans for a Conventional Subdivision Plan and an Open Space Subdivision Plan, for informal consideration by the Commission. The preparation of the Preliminary Layout Plans are recommended to facilitate the general consideration of factors and problems affecting the development of the land before the applicant proceeds with the official application and the preparation of final maps, plans, and documents required for formal consideration by the Commission. The presentation of preliminary layout plans will more readily facilitate alterations and changes recommended by the Commission. Neither the Pre-Application Conference nor the formal consideration of Preliminary Layout Plans shall be deemed to constitute any portion of the official and formal procedure of applying for approval of any Final Subdivision Plan. If the Preliminary Layout Plan Process is followed the Commission will recommend if a Conventional Subdivision Plan or an Open Space Subdivision Plan is the appropriate design for submission under the formal submission procedure
3. Open Space Subdivisions will utilize a Homeowners Association for the management, maintenance and upkeep of all retained common area(s), sediment and erosion control structures, and street network within the subdivision. All streets shall be constructed to the Ashford Public Improvement Specifications. The Homeowners Association will conform to the requirements of Chapter V, Section I of these regulations. Open Space associated with the subdivision may be retained, managed and maintained by a Homeowner’s Association or any of the other open space disposition options outlined in Chapter V, Section D.
Section D General Density Limitations
For plans proposing less than ten (10) lots, the maximum number of lots for an Open Space Subdivision shall be determined by taking the number of buildable lots that would result for the
Town of Ashford
42
same parcel in a Conventional Subdivision design Plan and applying this resulting number to a cluster of lots to be located on land with a minimum of one (1) acre of buildable land per lot. For Open Space Subdivision plans proposing ten (10) or more lots, the lot yield may be increased by ten (10%) percent, each lot to be a minimum of one (1) acre of buildable land per lot.
Section E Open Space Use Limitations
1. Minimum Percentage of Open Space. The minimum percentage of land that shall be designated as permanent open space shall be fifty percent (50%). The Commission reserves the right to select that portion of the proposed subdivision to be dedicated for open space and it may reject or modify any area(s) proposed by the applicant. In determining total land to be reserved as open space, the Commission may consider the tract or tracts of land to be immediately subdivided. Areas to be reserved as open space shall be shown on the final subdivision map. All designated open space shall be located through the placement of permanent monuments at the location of every direction change as per Chapter VIII Section F and meet the requirements of the Ashford Public Improvement Specifications.
2. Use of Open Space Areas. The purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant. Storm-water management ponds or basins may be included as part of open space, provided that such ponds shall: i) contain water for less than forty-eight (48) hours or (ii) is a fire protection pond approved by the fire chief or his or her designee or (iii) is a permanent body of water which is designed and landscaped to simulate a natural pond. Land within the rights-of-way for underground utility lines may also be included as part of open space. However, land within the rights-of way of overhead power lines, streets, driveways or other surface utilities shall not be included in open space.
SectionF Design Standards for Open Space Subdivision The dimensional requirements for lots in an Open Space Subdivision shall be as specified in the Ashford Zoning Regulations. In designing an Open Space Subdivision, the applicant should consider the purposes set forth in Chapter V, Section A of these Regulations, the provisions and standards set forth in this Chapter VI, the provisions in the Ashford Zoning Regulations and the following factors:
1. Proposed lots and improvements should be designed and situated to minimize alteration of the natural site features to be preserved.
2. Proposed open space areas should include natural features located in the tract.
3. Individual lots should be arranged and situated to relate to surrounding properties, to improve the view from and the view of prospective home sites, to minimize the area devoted to motor vehicle access and travel, and to take advantage of passive and active solar heating opportunities.
4. The development should have design features that reflect the rural character of the immediate area, whether it is historic, agricultural or residential.
Town of Ashford
43
5. A conceptual rendering of the proposed clustered dwellings shall be provided for review and by the Design Advisory Board appointed by the Commission.
The Commission may modify any application so as to designate open space in locations other than those proposed, if it determines that such modified location(s) will better serve the purposes and satisfy the applicable criteria and standards of these Regulations and the Ashford Zoning Regulations.
Section G Dedication of Open Space Open space areas within an Open Space Subdivision shall be dedicated, using one of the methods outlined in Chapter V, Section D. The application shall suggest which of the foregoing entities is proposed to own the open space, but the Commission, as part of any approval of such application, may modify such designation to require ownership by an entity set forth above. The provisions of the Ashford Zoning Regulations set forth applicable criteria and limitations for such matters as development restrictions and covenants, instruments of open space conveyance, boundary designations, recording, rights to enforce, and association requirements, but, the Commission shall review the proposed method for final disposition of all open space.
Section H Exceptions An applicant may apply to the Commission for an exception to the open space subdivision plan requirements. The purpose of the exception is to provide flexibility with regard to parcels of land for which an Open Space Subdivision Plan would be impractical due to existing physical conditions or limitations, would create an undue hardship, or would be substantially detrimental to the character of, or property values in, surrounding areas. In evaluating, approving or disapproving an application for such an exception, the Commission may consider the following criteria:
1. The nature of the proposed development.
2. The nature of the resources present on the land.
3. The size of the subdivision.
4. Road access.
5. The shape of the parcel;
6. Any undue hardships that the creation of an open space subdivision would cause; and,
7. Any other factors the Commission deems appropriate.
An applicant who is granted an exception under this Section H may submit a Formal Application for a Conventional Subdivision Plan.
Section I Procedures Except as otherwise provided in these Regulations all Open Space Subdivision Plans and applications, as well as Conventional Subdivision Plans and applications submitted must meet the procedural and substantive requirements of these Regulations and the Ashford Zoning Regulations, as may be amended.

Chapter VII
Water Supply and Sanitary Waste Disposal
Section A Water Supply
1. Every proposed lot must be suitable for the installation of an adequate water supply consisting of a drilled well, artesian well or community water supply. Where evidence before the Commission indicates that water supply may not be adequate, whether because of poor quality, insufficient quantity or other reason, the subdivider may be required to submit additional information demonstrating the adequacy, quality and quantity of the proposed water supply. Such information shall be submitted to the Town Director of Health or other appropriate Town official for review and comment. The Commission may also require the installation of test wells in one or more locations prior to issuing approval of any Final Subdivision Plan.
2. If the use of a community water supply system is proposed, the subdivider shall submit a plan in compliance with evidence of an approval by the Town Director of Health.
Section B Sanitary Waste Disposal
1. No lot requiring an individual septic system for sewage disposal shall be considered for approval by the Commission until the lot has been approved by the Town Director of Health, Town Sanitarian, or other appropriate Town official as suitable for the system. Percolation tests, soil reports, and the relevant Town official’s report must be submitted with the Subdivision Application. Where evidence indicates special cause for concern, the Commission may require additional information in applications, including, but not limited to, a permeability analysis and/or renovation analysis of bacteria, phosphates, or other pollutants.
2. It is the responsibility of the subdivider to contact the Town Director of Health or Town Sanitarian to prove that the lot area is adequate to permit the installation and operation of an individual sewage disposal system. The subdivider shall provide the necessary equipment and labor for the making of any and all tests required by Town health officials. When Town health approval is given subject to conditions, such conditions shall be noted on the record map.
3. A minimum of one (1) deep observation hole and percolation test shall be performed in each proposed primary, and in each proposed reserve septic system leaching area indicated on the subdivision plans.

2. New Streets: Where the subdivision adjoins land susceptible to being subdivided, the Commission may require new streets to be carried to the boundaries of any proposed subdivision. All new streets shall employ traffic calming measures. It is preferred streets be designed to be curvilinear rather than linear. Street crossings over wetlands, swamps, brooks and watercourses shall be designed to have the least impact and cross at the narrowest width possible consistent with good design. The street(s) shall be appropriately related to the topography and terrain, both within the subdivision and the surrounding lands. Street and lots shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building lots at or above the grades of the street. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original topography. Streets having steep grades, high fills or deep cuts shall be avoided. Street and lots shall be carefully designed to minimize the need for regarding and defoliation of the site.
3. Reserved Rights-of-Way. When required by the Commission, the owner shall dedicate to the Town reserved rights-of-way for future street connections to adjoining property
Town of Ashford
46
susceptible to being subdivided. Such reserved rights-of-way shall be included in an agreement by and between the Town of Ashford and the owner, and shall include slope rights of fifteen linear feet (15’) outside of the street right-of-way. These rights-of-way shall have necessary radial intersections. Lots adjoining these rights-of-way shall be laid out so that access to the house or garage shall not be over the reserved right-of-way.
4. Slope Rights: Where new Town owned streets abut private property, slope rights of fifteen feet (15’) on each side of the street right-of-way shall be obtained by the applicant, and these slope rights shall be shown on the Final Subdivision Plan submission to the Commission. Such slope rights shall be transferred in the form of an easement to the Town of Ashford. The applicant shall investigate the effect of cuts or fills on adjacent private property within the slope right areas. The applicant shall provide the Town with evidence that no drainage problems or other problems will arise on adjacent property due to construction or fill operations.
5. Street Designation: The designation for each new or existing street as arterial, collector or local will be determined by the Commission after evaluating the following factors:
a. The type of land use permitted in the subject zone, and/or proposed for the subdivision, such as, residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional;
b. The residential density and/or development intensity of any permitted and/or proposed land uses;
c. The number of acres or residential units or non-residential buildings to be served, both immediately and in the future, including potential extensions of existing or proposed streets;
d. The physical characteristics of the property through which the street is proposed, such as topography, geology, water table, and the like;
e. The recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development, including traffic calming measures.
6. Street Widening: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street that does not comply with the specified width requirements, the owner shall dedicate the necessary area to the Town or Association, as the case may be, for street widening and the applicant shall show such widening on the Formal Subdivision Plan
7. Street Signs: One street sign and supporting post shall be installed at all new street
intersections at the expense of the subdivider and shall conform to the requirements of the Town of Ashford.
8. Cul-de-sac Streets: A cul-de-sac street shall not originate at a loop street or another cul
-de-sac street. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed eight hundred feet (800’) in length which shall be measured from the center line of the through street it intersects at its origin. There shall be no more than two cul-de-sacs to any subdivision. There shall not be any
Town of Ashford
47
lots that do not meet the minimum frontage requirements of the Ashford Zoning Requirements. Cul-de-sac streets serving more than eight lots shall have two (2) segments of street pavement twenty feet (20’) wide load bearing, sixteen feet (16’) of which is paved, on each side of a dividing island at least eight foot (8’) in width. A native shrub planting plan for the center island shall be presented to the Commission. The developer/subdivider shall be required to set up a properly funded homeowners association or other legally effective mechanism for continuous future maintenance of the center island at no expense to the Town. This mechanism and the person(s) or titles of person(s) responsible shall be described on the Subdivision Plan. An appropriate document, legally sufficient to establish and continue the maintenance mechanism, shall be presented to the Commission in draft form at the time the Subdivision Application is filed. The document shall provide for adequate funding and shall give the Town of Ashford the right to perform such necessary maintenance and secure reimbursement of the appropriate funds in the event the responsible person(s) do not fulfill their obligations. The final document shall be properly executed and filed in the Ashford Land Records as a condition of Final Subdivision approval. There is a bond requirement for implementation and completion of the island and no home construction may begin until the Town has approved the completed street and island. When a cul-de-sac street is proposed as a temporary measure pending future development of adjoining property, it shall be so designed as to be feasible of continuation in the adjacent tract. Where a cul-de-sac street does not extend to the boundaries of a parcel, it shall be generally separated from such boundaries by a distance not less than the minimum lot depth required by the Zoning Regulations. A cul-de-sac street shall be provided with a turnaround designed and constructed to the Ashford Public Improvement Specifications.
9. Street Turnaround: Any street requiring a temporary turnaround where it can reasonably be expected the street will continue into adjoining land in the future or where a permanent cul-de-sac street is shorter than allowed and said street is likely to be extended to provide access to additional allowable lots. Cul-de-sacs having an island in the center of the vehicular turnaround may be permitted on a case by case basis. Temporary turnarounds shall be constructed to meet the requirements of the Ashford Public Improvement Specifications.
Land for a temporary turnaround shall be provided to the legal entity responsible for the street in the form of an easement which shall contain a condition for automatic termination of the easement upon extension of the street.
Pavement of the temporary turnaround shall be removed upon termination of the easement and as a condition of the projection of the street into the adjoining property. The pavement for the temporary turnaround shall be removed by the subdivider who provides the extension of the street, and the same subdivider shall also improve the
Town of Ashford
48
street in the area of the temporary turnaround to meet the requirements of the Ashford Public Improvement Specifications. When there is a possibility of extension of a street, all portions of the street, including pavement, slope rights, grass strip, and sidewalk that fall outside of the limits of the normal right-of-way width shall occupy the space by virtue of an easement delivered to the Town before acceptance of the street. The applicant (subdivider) extending any street shall be required to: remove the existing pavement outside of the standard traveled way; loam and seed the area in which pavement has been removed; extend any curbs and sidewalks; extend existing driveways; and relocate mail and paper boxes in the original street area in accordance with Town requirements and all at the subdivider’s expense.
10. Loop Streets: Loop streets shall not originate at another loop street or a cul-de-sac street. Loop streets shall not provide access to more than twenty (20) lots. No lots within the loop shall have its rear line fronting on the loop street.
11. Existing Street Improvements/Access: Whenever a subdivision is proposed for land accessible only by an unpaved street which does not conform with minimum requirements of grade, alignment, width or construction set forth in these Regulations, and/or the Public Improvement Specifications, the Commission may determine that approval of the subdivision plan would be contrary to the public safety unless such street is altered or improved where it fronts the proposed subdivision or beyond the limits of the proposed subdivision.
12. Scenic Roads, Stone Walls, Stone Foundations, and Street Trees: Frontage improvements, as described in the preceding section, may be modified by the Commission in order to achieve the objectives of the Scenic Road Ordinance. In addition, the Commission shall consider the existence and preservation of stone walls, stone foundations, and street trees which are part of Ashford’s historic character.
13. Specification and Details: All street improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the Town of Ashford Public Improvement Specifications.
14. Home Owners’ Association: All Loop Streets and Cul-de-sac Streets shall be owned and maintained by an approved Home Owners’ Association meeting the criteria of Chapter V, Section I.
15. Utilities: All utilities for new streets, and for new dwellings on existing streets with above ground utilities, shall be installed underground. Such utilities include, but are not limited to, those required for electrical, communication, lighting and cable television sources and related facilities; except surface-mounted transformers, surface-mounted connection boxes and meter cabinets, temporary utility service facilities during construction, high capacity electric and communication feeder lines, which may be placed above ground. The subdivider shall make all necessary arrangements with the service utility to provide the underground services. The method of installation shall be approved by the particular utility company and be in conformance with the utility location requirements of these
Town of Ashford
49
Regulations. The Commission shall have final review of all utility screening and landscaping.
In making the determination set forth in the preceding paragraphs, the Commission shall take into account the street’s ability to handle the increased volume of traffic which will be generated by the proposed subdivision, the ability of school buses and emergency vehicles to travel the street safely, the drainage conditions of the street, and the ability of any vehicle to use the street safely.
Section C Lots
1. Adjacent Land: If the owner of a proposed subdivision also owns adjacent land that does not meet the minimum requirements for a lot in the respective zone, such adjacent land must be incorporated into the proposed subdivision. The Commission shall not approve any subdivision containing one or more fragments or parcels that would not meet the minimum requirements for a developable lot unless such fragments or parcels expressly intended to be dedicated to a public use acceptable to the Commission.
2. Useless Land: No lot, regardless of size, which is rendered useless for building due to utility easements, right-of-way, watercourses, wetlands, topography, geologic condition or lack of compliance with the Public Health Code, shall be shown as a building lot on any subdivision. Except as provided in Chapter X and Chapter XI such property shall be included in adjoining lots.
3. Lot Lines. Side lines of lots shall, insofar as practicable, be either at right angles or radial to street lines. Variations from this rule will be made only where it is impractical to do otherwise, and shall require approval in accordance with the Ashford Zoning Regulations.
4. Off-Street Parking. Space shall be provided on all lots for off-street parking.
5. Lot Boundary Markers. A lot boundary marker shall be placed by the subdivider’s surveyor on each lot corner and also at any point where a change of a lot line occurs. Such marker may be a steel rod, iron pin, drill hole, or other equally permanent method and it shall be clearly marked with an indelible paint. The permanent marker location shall be shown on the Final Subdivision Plan Map and must be placed on the site prior to the issuance of a final Certificate of Use and Compliance on the subject lot. Upon the specific request of the applicant in the subdivision application form, the commission may waive this requirement on extraordinarily large lots or remaining tracts of property in accordance with Chapter XI of these Regulations.
6. Lot Size. To ensure that all proposed subdivision lots have an adequate area for on-site water and sewerage systems, house and accessory building locations, driveways and parking area and usable recreation space; to minimize drainage problems and facilitate ground water discharge; and to minimize potentially detrimental encroachments upon watercourses, waterbodies, wetland soils and flood plain areas; all proposed subdivision lots, except as otherwise permitted under the Ashford Zoning Regulations, as may be amended, shall comply with the requirements of the Ashford Zoning Regulations.
Town of Ashford
50
7. Lot Frontage: No lot shall be approved which does not have the required frontage as per the Ashford Zoning Regulations. All approved lots shall only have access on a street which is constructed or bonded for construction in conformance with the Ashford Public Improvement Specifications. Interior lots, back lots and so called flag lots are prohibited in Open Space Subdivisions.
8. Driveways
a. An application for the approval of a subdivision or re-subdivision plan that involves the construction or installation of driveways, including associated drainage improvements, shall constitute an agreement by the applicant/subdivider to be responsible for the construction and completion of any or all driveways, including common driveways, the Commission may deem necessary to serve any lot(s) to be conveyed following approval of the plan. b. In addition the Commission may require a one (1) or more year maintenance bond, as set forth in Chapter IX, upon completion of any driveway(s) to insure such driveway(s), including drainage improvements, function properly. The amount of the bond shall be in an amount determined by the Commission. The Commission’s ability to call a subdivision bond or other surety pursuant to CGS Section 8-26c(c) shall not prevent the Commission from seeking to enforce the responsibility of the applicant/subdivider to complete driveway improvements.
9. Common Driveways
a. Common Driveways shall be allowed in accordance with the Ashford Zoning Regulations. b. A driveway easement shall be filed on the deeds of the affected lots to clearly establish liability and maintenance agreements in the form set forth in Appendix F. Said deed restriction shall be approved by the Town of Ashford Planning and Zoning Commission and filed on the land records prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Use and Compliance on any of the subject lots.
Section D Storm Drainage (Please see Ashford Public Improvement Specification)
Storm drainage systems constructed under these Regulations shall provide for the proper drainage of the tributary area so as to prevent flooding, scouring, siltation or insufficient flows to brooks, lakes, ponds, and other watercourses, intermittent streams and waterbodies, and other adverse impacts. The subdivider shall make provisions for preventing the creation of stagnant water within the limits of the proposed subdivision. All land development, redevelopment and land conversion activities shall maintain the after development runoff characteristics as equal to or less than the pre-development runoff characteristics in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, siltation, non-point source pollution, property damage, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats.
Town of Ashford
51
Section E Inspection (Please see Ashford Public Improvement Specification)
1. All subdivision Improvements to be dedicated to the Town shall be inspected by the Commission or such agent as may be designated by the Commission, in consultation with the Board of Selectmen.
2. Inspections shall be made at the following stages of construction:
a. When rough grading is complete.
b. When drainage and all other underground facilities are installed, but prior to any backfilling.
c. During construction of street base courses.
d. During construction of bituminous concrete surface and binder courses.
e. During the placing of concrete for sidewalks.
f. When curbing is complete.
g. A final inspection shall be made when all Improvements are complete, and before acceptance by the Town.
Section F Street Monument (Please see Ashford Public Improvement Specifications) Street monuments shall be placed at all block corners, at angle points, and the points of curves in streets and at such intermediate points as may be necessary to identify the street line in the field. The location of all street monuments shall be indicated on the final subdivision plan. They shall be installed and their accuracy certified by a Licensed Land Surveyor. The monuments shall be made of concrete, and shall meet all requirements of the Public Improvement Specifications.

Chapter IX
Insurance, Bond Requirements, Certificate of Use, Bond Release, and Agreement for Installation of Improvements ANY PERSON WHO SUBMITS AN APPLICATION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF A SUBDIVISION BASED UPON THE PROVISION OF A BOND IN LIEU OF THE COMPLETION OF ALL REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND UTILITIES SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED ALL OF THE TERMS IN THIS CHAPTER. THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT ISSUE ANY FINAL APPROVAL OF A SUBDIVISION APPLICATION BASED UPON THE PROVISION OF A BOND UNLESS THE APPLICANT AGREES TO ABIDE BY THESE PROVISIONS AND EXECUTE THE RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENT DESCRIBED IN APPENDIX “B”.
Section A Insurance
1. The subdivider shall file with the Commission, on a form provided by the Town, a general liability insurance policy. This policy shall have a term no less than that of the Performance Bond and shall be extended in conformance with any extension of the Performance Bond.
2. The policy shall insure the Town of Ashford and the subdivider against all claims for damage or injury to persons or property that may arise from any and all aspects of the construction, installation, or maintenance, or lack thereof, of any subdivision improvements, or from any operations in the development or completion of the subdivision; including but not limited to, clearing, removal of vegetation, grading, excavating, filling, inspection, testing, water well installation, sediment and erosion control measures, and road construction and improvements. The policy shall have the following limits:
Property Damage (including automobile) Each Accident: Not less than $1 million. Bodily Injury (including automobile) Each Person: Not less than $1 million. Each Accident: Not less than $1 million.
Section B Performance Bond
1. A Performance Bond in such form and amount as the Commission shall require in accordance with these Regulations shall be posted by the subdivider prior to the commencement of construction of any improvement or work on any lot to insure the completion of required improvements and utilities in the event the subdivider shall fail timely to install the same. The term of any Performance Bond proposed by the developer should be the same as the normal duration of the subdivision approval pursuant to state law. Any developer who proposes to submit a Performance Bond having a shorter term shall be deemed to have accepted the risk that the Bond will not be renewed and that the
Town of Ashford
53
approval of the subdivision shall lapse and become null and void if it is not renewed. The developer shall be entitled to complete all required subdivision improvements within the time allowed by state law, provided the developer continuously maintains the Performance Bond, or a substitute Performance Bond acceptable to and approved by the Commission in accordance with these Regulations, for the full duration of such time. If, at any time, the Performance Bond lapses, is terminated or withdrawn, or ceases to be effective or in force, regardless of whether the developer is responsible for such circumstances, the subdivision approval shall, after notice to the subdivider and the opportunity to be heard, lapse and become null and void except as provided hereafter. Within 30 days after the date of any such lapse, termination, withdrawal, or cessation of the effectiveness of any such Performance Bond, the developer may submit to the Commission a written request for approval of a substitute Performance Bond. No such request shall be granted unless the developer or a designated agent or representative of the developer attends the meeting of the Commission at which the matter is to be considered. It shall be the developer’s responsibility to be aware of the date, place and time of such meeting. The Commission may deny such request if it determines that such proposed substitute Performance Bond does not provide adequate security for the timely completion of all required subdivision improvements and utilities or if it determines that the developer has failed to comply with any terms or conditions of the subdivision approval or any of these Regulations that are applicable to the subdivision approval. The Commission may also approve the provision of a substitute Performance Bond different in form and amount than that requested by the developer. In the event the Commission approves the provision of a substitute Performance Bond, the developer shall be allowed 30 days following the date of such approval to submit the substitute Performance Bond. The Commission may, upon the developer’s written request, extend the time within such substitute Performance Bond may be provided by no more than an additional 30 days. If the developer fails to provide the substitute Performance Bond within such period of 30-60 days, or if the developer fails to submit a written request for approval of a substitute Performance Bond within the time set for above, the subdivision approval shall become immediately null and void. Nothing in this section will prevent or prohibit subsequent subdivision of the property.
2. Separate Sedimentation and Erosion Control Bond: Measures and facilities specified on the approved Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall be guaranteed by a separate cash or savings account bond assigned to the Town. No Development shall commence until said bond shall be posted. In the event the developer fails to maintain proper sedimentation and erosion controls on the subdivision site, the security required under this section may be used by the Town to stabilize eroding areas, remove sediment, and otherwise correct sedimentation and erosion problems on site at the sole discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission or its designated agent.
3. Restoration: In the event the subdivision approval terminates or lapses before all required subdivision improvements and utilities have been completed, the Commission may, in its discretion, and subject to any contrary provisions of state law, use the funds available in the Performance Bond to restore all or any portion of the site to a natural condition. The Commission shall not use the Performance Bond to restore the site if the cost to complete all required improvements and utilities would be less than the cost of performing such restoration. The Commission shall not make any decision to use a
Town of Ashford
54
Performance Bond for restoration without obtaining an estimate for the costs of oversight of the project and any additional engineering costs to complete all required improvements and utilities from the Town Engineer or a similarly qualified consultant.
4. In computing the amount of a Performance Bond, the Commission shall consider the following items:
a. The construction cost of all required improvements, including storm drainage system, roads and pavements, sidewalks and curbs, roadside landscaping and trees, grading, setting of monuments, and any other requirements made as a condition for subdivision approval or depicted on the endorsed Final Subdivision Plan, Plan Profile, and Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan.
b. Costs for the Town to advertise and award a contract for construction of the improvements or site restoration; and the costs for the Town to oversee and manage such contract(s).
c. Costs shall be projected to a point at the end of the Performance Bond term. Any extension of the term of the Performance Bond may result in an adjustment as to the Bond total.
d. The total estimated cost of the Performance Bond shall also include a 15% addition to cover contingencies and engineering plus an inflation factor that is equal to the current Consumer Price Index measure of inflation.
e. Where a subdivision is to be developed in phases, the subdivider may petition the Commission in writing for permission to post a Performance Bond covering the costs itemized in paragraphs (d) 1 through 4 above, related to those improvements and utilities located within or required to serve one or more phases rather than for the entire development. Similar permission shall be obtained by the subdivider prior to commencing development of any or all additional phases. Where the subdivider bonds in phases as authorized in this paragraph, no improvement, as that term is defined in these Regulations, shall be commenced in any phase for which no bond has been posted, and no lots shall be sold in such phase
5. As used in these Regulations, the term "Performance Bond" shall refer to one of the following methods of assuring completion of Subdivision Improvements:
a. Cash in the form of a certified check; a passbook, assigned to the Town by assignment forms prescribed by the Commission's legal counsel or a letter of credit in favor of the Town in the form included as Appendix D of these regulations. The bank ("Surety") or lending institution issuing the passbook or letter of credit shall be one maintaining offices in Hartford, Windham or Tolland Counties in the State of Connecticut.
b. A surety company bond in sum and form satisfactory to the Commission. Such company (“Surety”) shall be one maintaining offices in the State of Connecticut.
Town of Ashford
55
6. The bond forms set forth in the preceding paragraph shall be as provided by the Town and shall be the only ones acceptable to the Commission. The amount of the Bond shall be the sum the Commission shall require. The completion date of all required Improvements shall be the end of the term of the Bond or any extension thereof, but, in no event, longer than the period set forth in CGS Section 8-26c.
7. For all Performance bond documents: If the subdivision applicant is a corporation, then the corporate seal must be shown in addition to the seal of the lending institution issuing the passbook assignment or Letter of Credit, and a corporate resolution must be provided indicating that the corporate officer executing the bond documents has authority to do so. If the subdivision applicant is a partnership, then a partnership resolution must be provided indicating that the partner executing the bond documents has authority to do so. Any corporation shall provide a Certificate of Good Standing from the Connecticut Secretary of the State; any limited partnership shall provide a Certificate of Legal Existence from the Connecticut Secretary of the State; out-of-state applicants shall present evidence from the Secretary of the State that they are authorized to do business in Connecticut.
8. If at any time, the bond required by this Section shall not be in effect because of incomplete or unaccepted public improvements, the Commission may file a caveat on the Land Records warning potential purchasers of such fact.
Section C Certificate of Zoning Compliance Before any Certificate of Zoning Compliance may be issued for any building in such subdivision on a lot that fronts on a subdivision road that has not been accepted by the Town as a public road, the subdivider must complete such road, in accordance with all applicable specifications, up to a cul-de-sac or intersection with an existing road, to a stage in construction at which only the final asphalt surface course of the road remains to be done before completion of the road. The foregoing condition shall not apply to street trees, sidewalks, or other types of road-related improvements not required for vehicular travel, but shall apply to the installation of street name signs to facilitate the provision of emergency services. The balance of the work on such road, and all other public improvements, must also be bonded in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter IX. In addition, water supplies and effluent disposal systems shall be operational and accepted by the appropriate Town or State agencies prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance allowing the occupancy of a dwelling on any lot.
Section D Application of Bonds The Commission may call any surety bond and apply the proceeds of such bond to the construction and installation of required subdivision improvements and utilities in any of the following circumstances:
1. The Commission may call the bond at any time within sixty (60) days before the expiration or termination date of the bond, as that date may have been extended, if any portion of the required subdivision improvements or utilities has not been completed. If the Commission has called the bond under this subsection, and the expiration or termination date of the bond
Town of Ashford
56
is subsequently extended for a period of no less than one (1) additional year, or a replacement bond of equivalent or greater amount is subsequently provided in a form satisfactory to the Commission, the Commission shall have the option of proceeding to complete any portion of the required subdivision improvements and utilities under the original bond or accepting the extended or replacement bond in lieu of completing such improvements.
2. The Commission may call the bond at any time within sixty (60) days before the date, as it may have been extended, on which the approval of the subdivision is scheduled to expire under any applicable provision of state or local law if any portion of the required subdivision improvements or utilities has not been completed.
Section E Bond Release
1. Prior to the release of the Performance Bond the subdivider shall present a Cash Maintenance Bond equal to ten (10%) percent of the full amount (i.e., the highest amount set by the Commission before any subsequent reductions) of the Performance Bond. The Maintenance Bond shall be for a period of three (3) years after all construction activity has been completed and shall guarantee the improvements installed against defects in materials or workmanship, or damage caused to the improvements by any construction activity in the subdivision. The three-year period shall commence upon the effective date of the acceptance of any road or other public improvements by the Town of Ashford, as recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Department of Public Works.
2. Application for the release of any Bond upon completion of all required improvements shall include the submission of properly scaled as-built drawings, which shall include all changes in the plans as authorized by the Commission or it’s Engineer during the course of construction. The as-built drawings shall be signed and sealed by a Connecticut Registered Land Surveyor licensed in the State of Connecticut.
3. Upon submission of a written report from the Engineer that all or a certain specified stage in the construction of improvements has been satisfactorily completed, the developer may request that the Commission reduce any outstanding bond to reflect the cost of construction of the remaining improvements. The Commission may refuse such reductions if it finds the construction of any improvements in violation of any provision of these Regulations or the plans, terms, or conditions for any subdivision approved hereunder.
Section F Agreement For Installation Of Public Improvements An application for approval of a subdivision plan that involves the construction or installation of public improvements shall constitute an agreement by the subdivider to be personally responsible for the completion of any portions of the improvements the Commission may deem necessary to serve any lots that may be conveyed following approval of the plan. The Commission’s ability to call a subdivision bond or other surety pursuant to CGS Section 8-26c(c) shall not prevent the Commission from seeking to enforce the personal responsibility of the applicant to complete the necessary improvements.
Town of Ashford
57
The Commission shall not approve any subdivision plan that involves the construction or installation of public improvements unless the applicant signs an agreement acknowledging the foregoing personal responsibilities. The form of such agreement shall be as set forth in Appendix E.
Town of Ashford
58
Chapter X Lot Line Revisions
Section A Lot Line Revision in Approved Subdivision Plans The revision of any lot line or lot-lines shown in a subdivision plan that has been previously approved by the Commission shall be deemed to constitute a modification of the approved subdivision plan. Any and all such modifications must be reviewed and approved by the Commission. The Commission shall not hold a public hearing on any such proposed lot line revision unless the proposed revision would result in a re-subdivision, as defined in Section 8-18 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended. The Commission shall approve a proposed lot line revision unless it determines either (i) that one or more of the proposed reconfigured lots would not meet any applicable requirements of the Zoning Regulations, or (ii) that the proposed modification would result in a lot or lots that would be significantly more difficult to develop or use because of the location of such physical features as wetlands, watercourses, or steep or rocky areas within the reconfigured lot or lots.
Section B Lot Line Revision in Other Lots The revision of lot lines for adjoining, legally existing lots that predate the enactment of subdivision regulations in the Town of Ashford or that were lawfully created without subdivision approval shall not be deemed to be a subdivision and shall not require the review or approval of the Commission unless such revision results in the creation of a greater number of lots or parcels than existed before the revision.
Town of Ashford
59
Chapter XI Waiver of Regulations The Commission recognizes that each parcel of property is unique in location, dimensions, orientation, topography, etc., and the various factors in the design of subdivisions are variable with relation to each other and to the above characteristics of the property. Therefore, in accordance with CGS Section 8-26, the Commission may modify or waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such requirements as, in its judgment of the special circumstances and conditions, are not requisite to the interest of public health, safety and general welfare. In considering a modification or waiver under this Chapter, the Commission shall, by a three quarters (3/4) of all the members of the Commission, approve such modification or waiver upon a finding that all of the following conditions are met:
1. Conditions exist on the subject property that are not generally applicable to other land in the Town;
2. Said conditions would render the subject property, or some significant portion thereof, unusable for any viable use permitted in the subject zone if these Regulations were strictly applied;
3. The granting of the modification or waiver would be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these Regulations; and
4. The granting of the modification or waiver would not have a significant adverse impact on adjacent properties’ values, or the public health, safety, and welfare, and would not be in violation of the recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development, as the same may be amended from time to time.
Any request for modification or waiver under this Chapter shall be set forth on the Subdivision Application form, and, if granted, shall be noted on the Final Subdivision Plan with a reference to the lot(s) affected, and the Section of these Regulations modified or waived, and the extent or nature thereof. In granting or denying any request under this Chapter, the Commission shall state upon the record the reasons for such action.

Section A Penalty for Failure to Comply
1. Failure to Obtain Subdivision Approval: In accordance with CGS 8-25, any person, firm, corporation, partnership or association making the subdivision or re-subdivision of land without approval of the Commission shall be liable to a fine of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) for each lot sold or offered for sale. In the event that any subdivider shall violate these Regulations, or the conditions or requirements of any subdivision approved hereunder, the Commission may, following a public hearing with notice by certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or in part, any such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Ashford Land Records.
2. Violation of Subdivision Approval: Any person, firm, corporation, partnership or association that violates any provision of these Regulations or any condition of modification of any Subdivision approval; or fails to comply with the plans and other documentation submitted in accordance with these Regulations shall be provided notice of such violation by registered mail, return receipt requested. Said notice shall indicate the date of a regular or special meeting at which the Commission shall consider such violation, and the subdivider shall have the opportunity to be heard and present evidence at such meeting. If, following such meeting, the Commission determines that a violation as described in this paragraph has occurred, the Commission may take any or all of the following actions: allow a fifteen (15) day period for the initiation of correction of the violation(s), after which a fine of one hundred ($100.00) per day will be assessed for each violation; void the subdivision for any lots which have not been conveyed to purchasers not affiliated with the subdivider; call any bonds or letters of credit which have been placed to secure compliance with these Regulations and any approval granted hereunder; direct the Zoning Enforcement Officer to withhold any Certificate of Zoning Compliance for any such lot(s) in the subdivision; refuse to accept any public improvement in connection with such subdivision; refuse to grant any extension of time for the completion of improvements in such subdivision; require additional bonding; require additional engineering or other studies to evaluate the scope and nature of the violation; bring legal action seeking injunctive relief or such other relief as may at law or equity pertain.
When fines are assessed there shall be a monthly interest rate penalty after the first 30 days and after each successive 30 day period, at the established Town rate for non-payment. After three (3) months, if fines and penalties are not paid, a lien shall be placed on all lots covered under Sections 1) and 2) of this Chapter. In addition, any outstanding violation(s) of the Ashford Subdivision or Zoning regulations will preclude the Commission from accepting any new applications from such entity until violations are corrected and until all fines and penalties have been paid in full.
