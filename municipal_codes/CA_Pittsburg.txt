PUBLIC NUISANCES
Sections:

1.20.010    Findings and purpose.

1.20.030    Administrative citations and fee schedule.

1.20.040    Authority to issue administrative citations.

1.20.010 Findings and purpose.
The city council finds, determines and declares as follows:

A. The city wishes to encourage the development of land uses and well kept properties. The city recognized that property values and the general welfare of the community are founded in large part on appearance and maintenance of properties.

B. There is a need for greater emphasis on the maintenance of properties because certain conditions which appear to constitute nuisances are found to exist in the city.

C. The existence of property in a condition constituting a nuisance as defined below is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of this city and contributes substantially and increasingly to the problems of and the necessity for excessive and disproportionate expenditures for protection against hazards and diminution of property values, prevention of crime, and the preservation of the public health and safety and the maintaining of adequate police, fire and accident protection. Such problems are becoming increasingly direct and substantial in significance and effect.

D. The existence of public nuisances of the type designated, and the abatement of them, is reasonably related to the proper exercise of the police power in protecting the health, safety and welfare of the public, and the exercise of that power by this city is authorized by the Constitution of the State of California and applicable laws.

E. Unless corrective measures are continued to be undertaken to alleviate such conditions, the public health, safety and general welfare and the property values and social and economic standards of this community will be substantially depreciated. The abatement of such conditions will enhance the appearance and value of such properties and will improve the tax base of the city. [Ord. 935 § 6, 1987.]

1.20.020 Nuisance designated.

D. If a specific abatement procedure is set forth in another title of this code and it is inconsistent with this chapter, the specific abatement procedure controls.

E. The reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred due to any enforcement proceedings commenced by the city pursuant to this code shall be awarded to the prevailing party. The proceedings shall be considered to have commenced once the initial inspection of the property, which is the subject of the proceeding, has been conducted.

In no action, administrative proceeding, or special proceeding shall an award of attorneys’ fees to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by the city in the action or proceeding. Any award to the city of its attorneys’ fees shall be collectable as a recoverable expense and shall be included in the statement of expense provided for hereunder.

C. The enforcement officer shall serve the notice either personally or by first class mail, addressed to each person as the address appears on the last equalized assessment roll or as known to the enforcement officer. If no address appears, then a copy of the notice shall be mailed, addressed to the owner, at the address of the real property found to constitute a nuisance.

1.24.120 Procedure in case of emergency.
A. Estimated Cost Less Than $50,001. If the code enforcement officer or chief building official determines that a nuisance on a parcel of real property poses a significant and immediate danger to the public health or safety, and the estimated cost of abatement is less than $50,001, the official may summarily abate the condition as provided in PMC 1.24.030 and 1.24.070. Before summarily abating an emergency condition, the official shall make a diligent good faith effort, reasonable under the circumstances, to contact the owner. When abating a condition under this section, the official shall document in the file the nature of the emergency requiring summary abatement. After summary abatement, the official shall follow the procedures provided in PMC 1.24.080, 1.24.090, 1.24.100 and 1.24.110.

B. Estimated Cost $50,000 or More. When the conditions which constitute a nuisance pose a significant and immediate danger to the public peace, health and safety, and the estimated cost of abatement is $50,000 or more, the city council may order the nuisance abated immediately or take steps to abate the nuisance after adoption of a resolution declaring the facts which constitute the emergency. When abating a condition under this section, the official shall document in the file the nature of the emergency requiring summary abatement. After summary abatement, the city manager or his/her designee official shall follow the procedures provided in PMC 1.24.080, 1.24.090, 1.24.100 and 1.24.110.

1.24.130 Effect of failure to receive notice.
The fact that the owner or other person to whom notice is given under this chapter of the nuisance abatement proceedings does not receive notice, or a letter is returned by the post office as undeliverable, does not affect the validity of any abatement proceedings. [Ord. 935 § 7, 1987; Ord. 830 § 1, 1982.]

1.24.140 Cost of abatement a personal obligation.
Instead of making the expenses of abating a nuisance a lien upon the real property under PMC 1.24.100, the city may make the expenses the personal obligation of the property owner, tenant or other person creating, causing, committing or maintaining the nuisance. In such a case, all of the procedures of this chapter apply except those specifically related to assessment of the property. [Ord. 935 § 7, 1987; Ord. 830 § 1, 1982.]

1.24.150 Treble costs of abatement.
A. Upon the entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two-year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a condition on the property which may be abated as a public nuisance, the court may order the owner to pay treble the costs of the abatement.

B. This section does not apply to court-ordered abatement of dangerous buildings pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 17980. [Ord. 1014 § 1, 1991.]

2.53.010 Statement of purpose.
The ordinance codified in this chapter implements Chapter 10, Division 4, Title 1 of the Government Code of the State of California (Section 3500 et seq.) captioned “Local Public Employee Organizations,” by providing orderly procedures for the administration of employer-employee relations between the city and its employee organizations. However, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to supersede the provisions of state law, city ordinances, resolutions and rules which establish and regulate the merit and civil service system, or which provide for other methods of administering employer-employee relations. This chapter is intended, instead, to strengthen the city’s personnel system and other rules and procedures of administering employer-employee relations through the establishment of uniform and orderly methods of communications between employees, employee organizations and the city.

It is the purpose of this chapter to provide procedures for meeting and conferring in good faith with recognized employee organizations regarding matters that directly and significantly affect and primarily involve the wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment of employees in appropriate units and that are not preempted by federal or state law. However, nothing herein shall be construed to restrict any legal or inherent exclusive city rights with respect to matters of general legislative or managerial policy, which include among others:

A. The exclusive right to determine the mission of its constituent departments, commissions, and boards;

B. To set standards of service;

C. To determine the procedures and standards of selection for employment;

D. To direct, discipline and discharge its employees in accordance with law and existing ordinances, rules and regulations;

E. To relieve its employees from duty because of lack of work or for other lawful reasons;

F. To determine the content of job classifications;

G. To determine the methods, means, number and kind of personnel by which its operations are to be conducted, including the performance thereof by subcontract;

H. To administer the city’s personnel system;

I. To maintain the efficiency of governmental operations;

J. To take all necessary actions to carry out its mission in emergencies;

K. To exercise complete control and discretion over its organization and the technology of performing its work;

L. To determine methods of financing.

In the event that the exercise of one or more of these rights results in an impact on wages, hours or other terms and conditions of employment, as defined in California Government Code Section 3505, the city shall meet and confer with the recognized employee organization(s).

Consistent with California Government Code Section 3500 et seq. and the provisions of this chapter, employees shall have the right to form, join and participate in the activities of a recognized employee organization, free from interference and discrimination, for the purpose of representation on all matters of employer-employee relations. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013; Ord. 1168 § 2, 2000.]

2.53.020 Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

A. “Appropriate unit” and “bargaining unit” means a unit of employee classes or positions, established pursuant to Article II of this chapter, commencing with PMC 2.53.030.

B. “City” means the city of Pittsburg, and, where appropriate herein, refers to the city council or any duly authorized city representative as herein defined.

C. “Confidential employee” means an employee who, in the course of his or her duties, has access to confidential information relating to the city’s administration of employer-employee relations.

D. “Consult/consultation in good faith” means to communicate orally or in writing with any or all employee organizations, whether exclusively recognized or not, for the purpose of presenting and obtaining views or advising of intended actions.

E. “Day” means calendar day unless expressly stated otherwise.

F. “Employee relations officer” means the city manager or his/her duly authorized representative.

G. “Impasse” means that the representatives of the city and a recognized employee organization have reached a point in their meeting and conferring in good faith where their differences on matters to be included in a memorandum of understanding, and concerning which they are required to meet and confer, remain so substantial and prolonged that further meeting and conferring would be futile.

H. “Management employee” means a regular status employee having responsibility for formulating, administering or managing the implementation of city policies and programs.

I. “Proof of employee support” means (1) an authorization card recently signed and personally dated by an employee, or (2) a verified authorization petition or petitions recently signed and personally dated by an employee, or (3) employee dues deduction authorization, using the payroll register for the period immediately prior to the date a petition is filed hereunder, except that dues deduction authorizations for more than one employee organization for the account of any one employee shall not be considered as proof of employee support for any employee organization. The only authorization which shall be considered as proof of employee support hereunder shall be the authorization last signed by an employee. The words “recently signed” shall mean within 180 days prior to the filing of a petition.

J. “Exclusively recognized employee organization” means an employee organization which has been formally acknowledged by the city as the sole employee organization representing the employees in an appropriate representation unit pursuant to Article II of this chapter, commencing with PMC 2.53.030, having the exclusive right to meet and confer in good faith concerning statutorily required subjects pertaining to unit employees, and thereby assuming the corresponding obligation of fairly representing such employees.

L. “Employee” means any person employed by the city whose appointment to city service was made from a certified eligibility list, following completion of a competitive recruitment process, and is considered for purposes of the Pittsburg Municipal Code to be a regular employee. Excluded are those persons elected by popular vote, hourly, seasonal, contract and all others considered to be nonregular employees as defined under PMC 2.52.040. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013; Ord. 1168 § 2, 2000.]

2.53.030 Filing of recognition petition by employee organization.

J. A statement that the employee organization has in its possession proof of employee support as herein defined to establish that at least 30 percent of the employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate have designated the employee organization to represent them in their employment relations with the city. Such written proof shall be submitted for confirmation to the employee relations officer or to a mutually agreed upon disinterested third party;

K. A request that the employee relations officer formally acknowledge the petitioner as the exclusively recognized employee organization representing the employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate for the purpose of meeting and conferring in good faith;

L. An acknowledgment in writing, signed by a duly authorized officer of the employee organization, that the organization agrees to abide by all of the provisions of this chapter.

The petition, including the proof of employee support and all accompanying documentation, shall be declared to be true, correct and complete, under penalty of perjury, by the duly authorized officer(s) of the employee organization executing it. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013; Ord. 1168 § 2, 2000.]

2.53.040 City response to recognition petition.
Upon receipt of the petition, the employee relations officer shall determine whether:

A. There has been compliance with the requirements of the recognition petition; and

B. The proposed representation unit is an appropriate unit in accordance with PMC 2.53.080, if different from the initial unit determination.

If an affirmative determination is made by the employee relations officer on the foregoing two matters, he/she shall so inform the petitioning employee organization, shall give written notice of such request for recognition to the employees in the unit and shall take no action on such request for 30 days thereafter. If either of the foregoing matters are not affirmatively determined, the employee relations officer shall offer to consult thereon with such petitioning employee organization and, if such determination thereafter remains unchanged, shall inform that organization of the reasons therefor in writing. The petitioning employee organization may appeal such determination in accordance with PMC 2.53.100.

Following the 30-day waiting period after an affirmative determination is made by the employee relations officer, a written confirmation that the proposed unit is appropriate will be sent to the employee organization and an election arranged. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013; Ord. 1168 § 2, 2000.]

2.53.050 Open period for filing challenging petition.
Within 30 days of the date written notice was given to affected employees that a valid recognition petition for an appropriate unit has been filed, any other employee organization may file a competing request to be formally acknowledged as the exclusively recognized employee organization of the employees in the same or in an overlapping unit (one which corresponds with respect to some, but not all the classifications or positions set forth in the recognition petition being challenged) by filing a petition evidencing proof of employee support in the unit claimed to be appropriate of at least 30 percent and otherwise in the same form and manner as set forth in PMC 2.53.030. If such challenging petition seeks establishment of an overlapping unit, the employee relations officer shall call for a hearing on such overlapping petitions for the purpose of ascertaining the more appropriate unit, at which time the petitioning employee organizations shall be heard. Thereafter, the employee relations officer shall determine the appropriate unit or units in accordance with the standards in PMC 2.53.080. The petitioning employee organizations shall have 15 days from the date notice of such unit determination is communicated to them by the employee relations officer to amend their petition to conform to such determination or to appeal such determination pursuant to PMC 2.53.100. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013; Ord. 1168 § 2, 2000.]

2.53.060 Election procedure.
The employee relations officer shall arrange for a secret ballot election to be conducted by a party agreed to by the employee relations officer and the concerned employee organization(s), in accordance with such party’s rules and procedures subject to the provisions of this chapter. All employee organizations who have duly submitted petitions which have been determined to be in conformance with PMC 2.53.080 shall be included on the ballot. The ballot shall also reserve to employees the choice of representing themselves individually in their employment relations with the city. Employees entitled to vote in such election shall be those persons employed in regular permanent positions within the designated appropriate unit who were employed during the pay period immediately prior to the date which ended at least 15 days before the date the election commences, including those who did not work during such period because of illness, vacation or other authorized leaves of absence, and who are employed by the city in the same unit on the date of election. An employee organization shall be formally acknowledged as the exclusively recognized employee organization for the designated appropriate unit following an election/run-off election if it received a numerical majority (50 percent plus one) of all valid votes cast in the election. In an election involving three or more choices, where none of the choices receives a majority of the valid votes cast, a run-off election shall be conducted between the two choices receiving the largest number of valid votes cast; the rules governing an initial election being applicable to a run-off election.

There shall be no more than one valid election under this chapter pursuant to any petition in a 12-month period affecting the same unit.

In the event that the parties are unable to agree on a third party to conduct an election, the election shall be conducted by the California Mediation and Conciliation Service.

Costs of conducting elections shall be borne in equal shares by the city and by each employee organization appearing on the ballot.

A recognized employee organization shall thereafter annually, between December 1st and December 31st, file with the employee relations officer the statement required by PMC 2.53.030(A) through (H), inclusive, following which a confirmation of recognition will be issued by the city. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013; Ord. 1168 § 2, 2000.]

2.53.070 Procedure for decertification of exclusively recognized employee organization.
A decertification petition alleging that the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization no longer represents a majority of the employees in an established appropriate unit may be filed with the employee relations officer only during the month of March of any year following the first full year of recognition or during the 30-day period commencing 120 days prior to the termination date of a memorandum of understanding, whichever occurs later. A decertification petition may be filed by two or more employees or their representative, or an employee organization, and shall contain the following information and documentation declared by the duly authorized signatory under penalty of perjury to be true, correct and complete:

A. The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner and a designated representative authorized to receive notices or requests for further information;

B. The name of the established appropriate unit and of the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization sought to be decertified as a representative of that unit;

C. An allegation that the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization no longer represents a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit, and any other relevant and material facts relating thereto;

D. Proof of employee support that at least 30 percent of the employees in the established appropriate unit no longer desire to be represented by the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization. Such proof shall be submitted for confirmation to the employee relations officer or to a mutually agreed upon disinterested third party within the time limits specified in the first paragraph of this section.

An employee organization may, in satisfaction of the decertification petition requirements hereunder, file a petition under this section in the form of a recognition petition that evidences proof of employee support of at least 30 percent, that includes the allegation and information required under subsection (C) of this section, and otherwise conforms to the requirements of PMC 2.53.030.

The employee relations officer shall initially determine whether the petition has been filed in compliance with the applicable provisions of this section. If his/her determination is in the negative, he/she shall offer to consult thereon with the representative(s) of such petitioning employees or employee organization and, if such determination thereafter remains unchanged, shall return such petition to the employees or employee organization with a statement of the reasons therefor in writing. The petitioning employees or employee organization may appeal such determination in accordance with PMC 2.53.100. If the determination of the employee relations officer is in the affirmative, or if his/her negative determination is reversed on appeal, he/she shall give written notice of such decertification or recognition petition to the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization and to unit employees.

The employee relations officer shall thereupon arrange for a secret ballot election to be held on or about 15 days after such notice to determine the wishes of unit employees as to the question of decertification and, if a recognition petition was duly filed hereunder, the question of representation. Such election shall be conducted in conformance with PMC 2.53.060.

If, pursuant to this section, a different employee organization is formally acknowledged as the exclusively recognized employee organization, such organization shall be bound by all the terms and conditions of any memorandum of understanding then in effect for its remaining term. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013; Ord. 1168 § 2, 2000.]

2.53.080 Policy and standards for determination of appropriate units.
The policy objectives in determining the appropriateness of units shall be the effect of a proposed unit on (1) the efficient operations of the city and its compatibility with the primary responsibility of the city and its employees to effectively and economically serve the public, and (2) providing employees with effective representation based on recognized community of interest considerations. These policy objectives require that the appropriate unit shall be the broadest feasible grouping of positions that share an identifiable community of interest. Factors to be considered shall be:

A. Similarity of the general kinds of work performed, types of qualifications required, and the general working conditions;

B. History of representation in the city and similar employment; except, however, that no unit shall be deemed to be an appropriate unit solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized;

C. Consistency with the organizational patterns of the city;

D. Number of employees and classifications, and the effect on the administration of employer-employee relations created by the fragmentation of classifications and proliferation of units;

E. Effect on the classification structure and impact on the stability of the employer-employee relationship of dividing a single or related classifications among two or more units.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, managerial and confidential responsibilities, as defined in PMC 2.53.020, are determining factors in establishing appropriate units hereunder, and therefore managerial and confidential employees may only be included in a unit consisting solely of managerial or confidential employees respectively.

In accordance with Government Code Section 3508, peace officers may join, participate in, and be represented by separate units composed solely of such peace officers. These units shall not be subordinate to any other employee organization. These units may include managerial and supervisory employees.

After notice to and consultation with affected employee organizations, the employee relations officer shall allocate new classifications or positions, delete eliminated classifications or positions, and retain, reallocate or delete modified classifications or positions from units in accordance with the provisions of this section. The decision of the employee relations officer shall be final. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013; Ord. 1168 § 2, 2000.]

2.53.090 Procedure for modification of established appropriate units.

The employee relations officer shall process such petitions as other recognition petitions under PMC 2.53.040.

The employee relations officer may at the request of any employee or group of employees propose that an established unit be modified. Such requests shall be submitted in the form of a recognition petition and, in addition to the requirements set forth in PMC 2.53.030, shall contain a complete statement of all relevant facts and citations in support of the proposed modified unit. The employee relations officer shall give written notice of the proposed modification(s) to any affected employee organization and shall hold a meeting concerning the proposed modification(s), at which time all affected employee organizations shall be heard. Thereafter the employee relations officer shall determine the composition of the appropriate unit or units in accordance with PMC 2.53.080, and shall give written notice of such determination to the affected employee organizations. The employee relations officer’s determination may be appealed as provided in PMC 2.53.100. If a unit is modified pursuant to the motion of the employee relations officer hereunder, employee organizations may thereafter file recognition petitions seeking to become the exclusively recognized employee organization for such new appropriate unit or units pursuant to PMC 2.53.030.

[Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013.]

2.53.160 Declaration of impasse and scheduling of impasse meeting.
If the meet and confer process has reached an impasse as defined in this chapter, either party may declare impasse and invoke impasse procedures by submitting to the other a written declaration of impasse, together with a statement in detail of its position on all disputed issues. An impasse meeting shall then be scheduled by the employee relations officer. The purpose of such impasse meeting shall be:

A. To identify and specify in writing the issue or issues that remain in dispute;

B. To review the positions of the parties in a final effort to resolve such disputed issue or issues; and

If the parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation, and agree on selection of a mediator, the dispute shall be submitted to mediation. All mediation proceedings shall be private. The mediator shall make no public recommendation, nor take any public position at any time concerning the issues. If the parties do not agree to utilize mediation and agree on a mediator within 10 days following the date that either party provided the other with a written notice of a declaration of impasse, the dispute shall not be submitted to mediation. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013.]

An exclusive representative may request that the parties’ differences be submitted to a fact-finding panel pursuant to California Government Code Section 3505.4. Such a request may be filed with the California Public Employment Relations Board (PERB):

1. Mutual Agreement on a Chairperson.

a. Use of a Binding Strike Process. The parties may agree at any time, either before or after receiving the list, to reach mutual agreement on a chairperson by using the PERB list (or any other agreed upon list) to participate in a strike process, the results of which will be binding upon the parties. Should the parties agree to use a binding strike process, the individual selected as a result of this process shall be considered by both parties to be “mutually agreed upon” under Government Code Section 3505.4(b) and PERB Regulation 32804.

b. Agreement Through Other Means. If the parties do not agree to use a binding strike process, the parties may otherwise mutually agree to designate as chairperson any individual from the PERB list; or any other individual.

2. Default Designation of a Chairperson by PERB. In the event the parties do not notify PERB within five working days (days on which PERB is officially open for business) that they have mutually agreed upon a person to chair the panel (either by using a binding strike process or otherwise), PERB will designate one of the seven persons on the PERB list.

3. Mutual Agreement May Override PERB Designation. In accordance with Government Code Section 3505.4(b), the parties may, within five days of PERB’s designation of a chairperson, notify PERB that the parties have mutually agreed on a chairperson (either by using a binding strike process or otherwise) in lieu of the individual previously selected by PERB.

2.53.220 Fact-finding report and recommended terms of settlement.
The fact-finding panel shall limit its findings and recommendations to matters within the scope of representation, unless the parties mutually agree in writing to submit additional issues to the panel that are nonmandatory subjects.

2.53.230 Implementation of last, best and final offer.
Upon the exhaustion of the impasse procedures described herein, and after the city has held a public hearing regarding the impasse, but no earlier than 10 days after the issuance of the fact-finding panel’s written findings and recommended terms for settlement, the city may implement its last, best and final offer. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013.]

2.53.240 Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this article is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this article. The board declares that it would have approved this article and each and every section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase not declared invalid or unconstitutional without regard to whether any portion of this article would be subsequently declared invalid or unconstitutional. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013.]

2.53.250 Operative date – Expiration – Transition.
This article shall be operative February 19, 2013. It shall remain operative only so long as mandatory nonbinding fact-finding under Government Code Section 3504.5 et seq. (or any subsequent applicable law or regulation) is required for the city. If at any time and for any reason the city is no longer subject to mandatory fact-finding, this article shall expire immediately and automatically and shall have no further force and effect. [Ord. 13-1366 § 2, 2013.]

2.53.260 Costs of impasse procedures.
Each party shall bear its own costs for mediation and fact-finding, including the costs of their advocates.

C. The board shall establish a minimum retirement age and such minimum retirement period of service which is not inconsistent with PMC 2.56.410; provided, that the board, after a review of all the facts and after having given the affected member a reasonable opportunity for a hearing before the board, may require any member so affected, upon attaining the minimum retirement age, to retire and to accept the benefits to which the member would be entitled upon attaining the minimum retirement age. If the board declares that any member, after duly considering the matter as herein provided, shall be retired, it shall be mandatory that the member be retired on the conditions provided by the board.

G. The board may hire, employ or engage a competent and qualified person to act as secretary for the board on either part-time or full-time basis as the board deems necessary to assist the board in all matters and in performing the administerial duties herein provided and as provided elsewhere in this article. The salary of the secretary shall be established by the approval of all of the members of the board, to be paid out of the funds of the retirement system; provided, that the secretary so appointed or selected shall not be eligible for benefits under the retirement system by reason of serving in this capacity alone; except that upon due application for membership made to the board, the board may, in its discretion, grant to the secretary the right to membership in the retirement system.

2.56.360 Retirement fund – Establishment.
A fund is created and established to be known as the “Pittsburg miscellaneous employees’ retirement fund of 1962.” It shall consist of all money paid into it in accordance with the provisions of this article, whether such moneys shall take the form of cash, securities or other assets. [§ 8 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.370 Retirement fund – Management.
The retirement fund shall be managed as follows:

A. The board shall have exclusive control and operation of the fund subject to the restriction that no investment shall be made except upon the affirmative vote of all members of the board and subject also to the terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions imposed by the laws of the state upon the making of investments by city retirement systems as set forth in Sections 45308.1, 45308.2 and 45308.3 of the Government Code.

B. The board, subject to such provisions as may be prescribed by law for the deposit of municipal funds in banks, may deposit cash belonging to the retirement fund in any licensed national bank or banks in this state, or in any bank, banks or corporations authorized or licensed to do banking business and organized under the laws of this state.

C. The city treasurer shall be the custodian of the retirement fund, subject to the exclusive control of the board as to the administration, deposit and investment of the fund, and the city treasurer shall perform all necessary duties relating to the safeguarding of and accounting for the assets of the fund, except as hereinafter provided. Subject to such provisions as may be prescribed by law, the board may, in its discretion, by resolution, designate state or national banks to perform some or all of the custodial duties which would otherwise be performed by the city treasurer.

All payments of the fund shall be made by check or warrant signed by two authorized persons, at least one of whom must be a member of the board. The board shall, by resolution, authorize two or more of its members to sign checks and warrants of the fund and the board may, by resolution, authorize the signature of the city treasurer as custodian or of a board employee to be one of the two names required on each check or warrant. All demands against the fund must be presented to, audited and approved for payment by the board. The board shall provide one or more corporate fidelity bonds, issued by a surety company licensed in the state, in such principal amount as the board may determine, to cover the city treasurer as custodian, the board members and any other persons authorized to receive or disburse assets of the retirement fund, the premium on the bond to be paid from the retirement fund.

D. Interest on any cash and any investments constituting a part of the fund shall be paid into the fund as received.

E. Except as herein provided, no member or employee of the board shall have any interest, direct or indirect, in any investment, the making thereof, or in the gains or profits accruing therefrom. No member or employee of the board, directly or indirectly, for himself or as an agent or employee of another, shall borrow, pledge or hypothecate any of its funds or deposits or in any manner use the same except to make such current and necessary payments as are authorized by the board; nor shall any member or employee of the board be an endorser, cosigner, guarantor or surety or in any manner be an obligor for moneys invested by the board. [Ord. 438 C.S. § 1, 1962; § 9 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.380 Guaranty.
A. The payments of the city into the Pittsburgh miscellaneous employees’ retirement fund of 1962, as provided in this article, and the payments of the city to the federal system, are made obligations of the city. The board shall prepare annually an estimate of the amounts necessary to meet such obligations and the city council shall appropriate such amounts as are necessary to make such payments.

B. The city by vote of the electorate may at any time change, modify or repeal this article or any part thereof in respect to its future obligations to any member not at that time receiving or being eligible to a pension under this article. It is specifically provided, however, and the city covenants and guarantees that the city’s obligation to those members receiving or eligible to a retirement allowance with respect to services credited under this article to the effective date of change, modification or repeal shall continue in full force and effect as provided in this article. The city’s obligation to those members not receiving or being eligible to a pension at the time of such change, modification or repeal shall be, with respect to service credited under this article prior to such change, modification or repeal, not less than a retirement allowance, upon reaching the minimum age of retirement, equal to the annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of the accumulated value of the member’s contributions standing to his credit at the date of retirement, plus a pension derived from city contributions equal to the annuity provided by the member’s accumulated normal and prior service contributions, increased further by the accumulations of the contributions to the date of retirement with interest, but without further contributions from the city.

C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, the retirement allowance payable upon retirement for service at age 65, or upon qualification for a federal benefit at an older age, to any member who transferred to this system from the retirement system of 1948, shall not be less than an amount which, when added to the primary insurance amount payable to him from the federal system, will equal the allowance which would have been payable had he continued his membership in the retirement system of 1948. [§ 10 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.390 Withdrawals.
Should the service of a member be discontinued, except by death or retirement, he shall have the option to withdraw all or part of his accumulated contributions. Payment thereof shall be made within one year after the date of demand; provided, that if in the opinion of the board the member is permanently separated from service by reason of such discontinuance, he shall be paid all of his accumulated contributions. Where after a previous discontinuance of city service a member withdrew all or part of his accumulated normal and prior service contributions and failed to redeposit such withdrawn amount in the retirement fund as provided in this section, the board may, in its discretion, delay for not more than one year after a member last rendered city service the withdrawal of all or part of his accumulated normal and prior service contributions.

Where a former member reenters service within three years after discontinuance of service, he may request redeposit in the retirement fund, in not to exceed 12 monthly payments, beginning with the date of reentry into the system, the amount of his accumulated normal and prior service contributions which he previously withdrew therefrom. If a member upon reentering the retirement system after a termination of his membership shall not make such redeposit at the time of his reentrance, the rate of his contribution for future years shall be the normal rate provided for in PMC 2.56.330(A) at his age of reentrance and he shall not receive credit for service to the city prior to the date of his reentrance; otherwise, his rate of contribution for future years shall be based on the same age as his rate prior to the termination of his membership and he shall receive credit for all service credited to him prior to his reentering.

Any other provision in this article to the contrary notwithstanding, a member whose accumulated contributions exceed $500.00 shall have a right to elect, not later than 90 days after the date upon which notice of the right is mailed by the board to the member’s latest address, whether to leave his accumulated contributions on deposit in the retirement system. Failure to make such election shall be deemed an irrevocable election to withdraw his accumulated contributions. An election to allow accumulated contributions to remain in the retirement fund may be revoked by the member at any time prior to receiving a retirement allowance. A member whose membership continues under this section is subject to the same age and disability requirements as applied to other members for service or disability retirement but he is not subject to a minimum service requirement. After the qualification of such member for retirement by reason of age or disability, he shall be entitled to receive a retirement allowance based upon the amount of his accumulated contributions and service standing to his credit at the time of retirement and on the city contributions held for him and calculated in the same manner as for other members, except that the provisions in this article for minimum service and disability retirement allowances do not apply to him unless he meets such minimum service requirements. If a death benefit becomes payable under this article because of death before retirement of such a member, the average annual compensation earnable in the year preceding the date of termination of such service shall be used in computing such benefit under PMC 2.56.470. [§ 11 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.400 Crediting of interest.
The board shall annually set the rate of interest to be credited on accumulated contributions of members and of the city. Such interest rate shall be based on the actual earnings of the fund and shall be compounded annually. Interest shall be credited to members’ accounts on June 30th of each year based on the balance in his account on the previous June 30th. Pro rata interest shall be credited to the date of termination. [§ 12 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.410 Service retirement.
A member who has attained age 55 and who is credited with at least 10 years of service may be retired upon his written application filed with the board. Retirement shall be compulsory upon the first day of the month next succeeding the month in which he attains age 65, regardless of service credited; provided, however, that no member shall be compulsorily retired until he has become eligible to receive the federal system primary insurance amount. [§ 13 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.420 Allowance upon service retirement.
Upon retirement for service, a member shall be entitled to receive, in addition to such benefits as may be paid by the federal system, a retirement allowance for life which shall be the sum of:

A. An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his accumulated contributions;

B. A current service pension which, when added to the annuity provided by his accumulated normal contributions, shall equal one-one hundred fortieth of the first $400.00 of the member’s final compensation per year of current service, plus one-seventieth of the member’s final compensation in excess of $400.00 per year of current service with which he is entitled to be credited at retirement;

C. A prior service pension which, when added to the annuity provided by the member’s accumulated prior service contributions, shall equal one-seventieth of the member’s final compensation per year of prior service with which he is entitled to be credited at retirement.

If retirement occurs before age 65, the above retirement allowance shall be reduced to that amount which the value of the allowance deferred to age 65 will provide at the actual age of retirement. [§ 14 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.430 Disability retirement.
Retirement of a member for disability shall be made by the board as provided herein: Upon the application of the head of the office or department in which a member is employed, or upon the application of a member or person acting in his behalf, stating that a member is physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of duty and ought to be retired, any member while in the service, or while mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of duty if such incapacity has been continuous from discontinuance of service, shall be examined by a qualified medical expert appointed by the board.

When a member is permanently incapacitated for the performance of duty as a result of injury or disease arising out of and in the course of his employment with the city, he shall be retired for disability with retirement allowance regardless of age or amount of service.

The board shall be governed by the findings of the Industrial Accident Commission of the state in the determinations of disability arising out of and in the course of a member’s employment with the city. Should a member be permanently incapacitated for the performance of his duty from any other cause whatsoever, he shall be retired regardless of age, but with retirement allowance only after 10 years of service. Permanent incapacity for the performance of duty shall in such cases be determined by the board.

The board, at the expense of the retirement fund, shall secure such medical services and advice as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of this section and of PMC 2.56.450. [§ 15 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.440 Allowance upon disability retirement.
Upon retirement for disability, a member shall receive, in addition to such benefits as may be paid by the federal system, a retirement allowance which shall consist of:

A. A life annuity which his accumulated contributions at the time of his retirement would entitle him to be based upon the actuarial tables adopted by the board;

B. If in the opinion of the board such disability is not due to intemperance, wilful misconduct or violation of law involving moral turpitude on the part of the member, a pension which, when added to the annuity in subsection (A) of this section, which is derived from his accumulated normal and prior service contributions, shall equal 90 percent of one-seventieth of this final compensation for each year of credited service if such allowance exceeds 25 percent of his final compensation; otherwise 90 percent of one-seventieth of his final compensation for each year of service which would have been credited had his service continued to age 65, but in no event shall such allowance exceed 25 percent of his final compensation. [§ 16 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.450 Safeguards on disability retirement.
A. The board may, at its pleasure, require any disability beneficiary, under age 65, to undergo medical examination, such examination to be made by a qualified doctor of medicine appointed by the board, at the place of residence of the beneficiary or other place of mutual convenience. Upon the basis of such examination, the board shall determine whether the disability beneficiary is physically or mentally incapacitated for service in the position held by him when retired for disability. Should the board determine that the beneficiary is not so incapacitated, his retirement allowance shall be canceled.

B. Should a disability beneficiary enter the service and be eligible for membership in the retirement system in accordance with PMC 2.56.320(A), his disability retirement allowance shall be canceled and he shall immediately become a member of the retirement system, his rate of contribution for future years being that established for his age at the time of such reentry. His individual account shall be credited with his accumulated contributions less the disability annuity payments made to him. Such member shall receive credit for the service credited to him prior to being retired.

C. Should the disability beneficiary prior to attaining age 65 reenter the service and be ineligible for membership in the retirement system, the board shall reduce the amount of his retirement allowance to an amount which, when added to the compensation earned by him upon reentry into the service, shall not exceed the final compensation on the basis of which his retirement allowance was determined.

D. Should any disability beneficiary under age 65 refuse to submit to medical examination, his allowance may be discontinued until he submits to such medical examination, and should such refusal continue for one year his retirement allowance may be canceled.

E. Should the retirement allowance of any disability beneficiary be canceled for any cause other than reentrance into the city service, he shall be paid his accumulated contributions, less the annuity payments made to him. [§ 17 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.460 Nomination and revocation of beneficiaries.
A member may nominate a beneficiary to whom the death benefit hereafter provided for shall be payable. Any nomination of a beneficiary made by a member may be revoked at the pleasure of the member and a different beneficiary may be nominated. All nominations and revocations of beneficiaries shall be filed with the records of the board. Nominations of beneficiaries heretofore made by members of the retirement system of 1948 who transfer to this retirement system of 1962 shall remain in effect until revoked. [§ 18 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.470 Death benefits.
Upon the death of a member before retirement, in addition to such benefits as may be paid by the federal system, there shall be paid to his designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or if there are none and the member leaves no property other than as specified in Section 630 of the Probate Code of the state, then upon furnishing the board with an affidavit as in said section provided, there shall be paid to the person or persons entitled to collect under said section of the Probate Code, and the receipt by such person or persons shall constitute sufficient acquittance therefor and shall fully discharge the board and the retirement system from any further liability with reference thereto without the necessity of inquiring into the truth of any of the facts stated in the affidavit, otherwise to his estate:

A. His accumulated contributions;

B. If death occurs while in the service of the city, or within one month after separation from service, or while physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of duty, provided his accumulated contributions have not been paid, a lump sum benefit equal to one month’s compensation earnable for each completed year of credited service not to exceed six years. [§ 19 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.480 Optional settlement.
In lieu of the retirement allowance for his life alone, a member or retired member may elect, or revoke or change a previous election prior to the approval of the previous election, to have the actuarial equivalent of his retirement allowance as of the date of retirement applied to a lesser retirement allowance, in accordance with one of the following optional settlements. Such election, revocation or change of election shall be made prior to the making of the first payment on account of any retirement allowance. If the member dies after retirement and within 30 days from the date upon which his election or changed election is received at the office of this system in Pittsburg, his election is of no effect, and his death shall be considered as that of a member before retirement.

A. Option 1. This optional settlement is the right to have a retirement allowance paid him until his death, and if he dies before he receives in annuity payments the amount of his accumulated contributions at retirement, to have the balance at death paid to his beneficiary or estate.

B. Option 2. This optional settlement is the right to have a retirement allowance paid him until his death and thereafter to his beneficiary for life.

The election of this modification shall not prevent the modification of the life portion of the resulting allowance under Options 2 or 3 as provided in PMC 2.56.480(B) and (C). [§ 22 of Ord. dated April 10, 1962.]

2.56.510 Monthly payments.

2.84.020 Findings.
The city council finds and declares that:

A. Decent housing is an essential motivating force in helping people to achieve self-fulfillment in a free and democratic society;

B. A healthy housing market is one in which residents of this state have a choice of housing opportunities and one in which the housing consumer may effectively choose within the free market;

C. There exists within the city a shortage of housing available to moderate and low-income persons, as such persons are now or hereafter defined by the provisions of the Act, and that this shortage is exacerbated during periods of high interest rates, particularly as high interest rates have the effect of diminishing the number of otherwise creditworthy buyers from qualifying for private sector mortgage capital sources, and in order to remedy this adverse effect on potential homebuyers on the lower end of the purchasing spectrum, it is necessary to implement a public program to reduce the cost of mortgage financing for single-family purchases for those persons unable to compete for mortgage financing in the conventional mortgage market; and

D. It is necessary, in order to implement a public program to reduce the cost of mortgage financing, to authorize long-term, low-interest mortgages to persons not presently eligible for financing through private sector lending institutions to finance construction, rehabilitation and acquisition of homes, and in order to finance the program, to issue mortgage revenue bonds to fund the program. [Ord. 1005 § 2, 1991.]

2.84.030 Liberal construction.
The provisions of this chapter, being necessary for the welfare of the city and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to effect the purpose of the program. [Ord. 1005 § 3, 1991.]

To impose a retail transactions and use tax (“tax”) in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a simple majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

C. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State sales and use taxes.

3.10.070 Notice by city not required.
The city is not required to send a delinquency or other notice or bill to any person subject to the provisions of this chapter, and failure to send such notice or bill shall not affect the validity of any marijuana business tax, interest or penalty due under the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 16-1423 § 2, 2016.]

3.10.080 Failure to report.
A. If any operator fails or refuses to collect the marijuana business tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the marijuana business tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such a manner as he or she may deem appropriate to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the marijuana business tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information upon which to base the assessment of any marijuana business tax imposed by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the marijuana business tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter.

B. The tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount of marijuana business tax assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the person so assessed at his or her last known place of address. Such person may, within 15 days after the serving or mailing of such notice, apply to the tax administrator in writing for a hearing on the amount assessed. If no such request is made within the time prescribed, the marijuana business tax, interest and penalties, if any, as determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such request is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such marijuana business tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified marijuana business tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper marijuana business tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such marijuana business tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in this chapter. [Ord. 16-1423 § 2, 2016.]

3.10.090 Deficiency determinations.
If the tax administrator is not satisfied that any report filed pursuant to this chapter is correct, the tax administrator may compute and determine the amount of marijuana business tax to be paid and make a deficiency determination upon the basis of the facts contained in the report or upon the basis of any information in the tax administrator’s possession or that may come into his or her possession within three years of the date the marijuana business tax was originally due and payable. One or more deficiency determinations of the amount of marijuana business tax due for a period or periods may be made. When a person discontinues engaging in a business, a deficiency determination may be made at any time within three years thereafter as to any liability arising from engaging in such business whether or not a deficiency determination is issued prior to the date the marijuana business tax would otherwise be due. Whenever a deficiency determination is made, a notice shall be given to the person concerned in the same manner as notices of assessment are given under PMC 3.10.080. [Ord. 16-1423 § 2, 2016.]

3.10.100 Appeal.
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such marijuana business tax or penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within 15 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of marijuana business tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. [Ord. 16-1423 § 2, 2016.]

3.10.110 Records.
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any marijuana business tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records that may be necessary to determine the amount of such marijuana business tax. The tax administrator shall have the right to inspect such records at all reasonable times. [Ord. 16-1423 § 2, 2016.]

3.10.120 Refunds.
A. Whenever the amount of any marijuana business tax, penalty or interest has been overpaid, paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded to the operator who paid the marijuana business tax; provided, that a written claim for refund is filed with the tax administrator within one year of the date the marijuana business tax was originally due and payable.

B. The tax administrator shall have the right to examine and audit all the books and business records of the claimant in order to determine the eligibility of the claimant to the claimed refund. No claim for refund shall be allowed if the claimant refuses to allow such examination of claimant’s books and business records after request by the administrator to do so.

C. In the event that the marijuana business tax was erroneously paid and the error is attributable to the city, the entire amount of the marijuana business tax erroneously paid shall be refunded to the operator. If the error is attributable to the operator, the city shall retain an amount from the refund reasonably calculated to cover expenses in verifying the error. [Ord. 16-1423 § 2, 2016.]

3.10.130 Tax deemed debt to city.
The amount of any marijuana business tax, penalties and interest imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt to the city, and any person or operator carrying on any business without having paid the marijuana business tax under this chapter to the city shall be liable to an action in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction for the amount of the marijuana business tax, and penalties and interest imposed on such business. [Ord. 16-1423 § 2, 2016.]

3.10.140 Exemptions.
Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, the terms hereof shall not be deemed or construed to apply to any person when imposition of the marijuana business tax upon that person would violate the Constitution of the United States or that of the state of California or preemptive federal or state law. [Ord. 16-1423 § 2, 2016.]

3.10.150 Other licenses, permits, taxes, fees or charges.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to repeal, amend, be in lieu of, replace or in any way affect any requirements for any license or permit required by, under or by virtue of any provision of any other title or chapter of this code or any other ordinance or resolution of the city or state, nor be deemed to repeal, amend, be in lieu of, replace or in any way affect any tax, fee or other charge imposed, assessed or required by, under or by virtue of any other title or chapter of this code or any other ordinance or resolution of the city or state. [Ord. 16-1423 § 2, 2016.]

3.10.160 Payment of tax does not authorize unlawful business.
A. The payment of a marijuana business tax required by this chapter, and its acceptance by the city, shall not entitle any person to carry on any marijuana business unless the person has complied with all of the requirements of this code and all other applicable laws, nor to carry on any marijuana business in any building or on any premises in the event that such building or premises are situated in a zone or locality in which the conduct of such marijuana business is in violation of any law.

3.12.010 Title.
This chapter shall be known as the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance of the city. [1937 Code § 170.]

3.12.020 Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter.

A. “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.

B. “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms or portion thereof in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

C. “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

D. “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

E. “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

F. “Tax administrator” means the tax and license collector of the city.

G. “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. [1937 Code § 170.1.]

3.12.030 Imposition and rate.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in an amount of not more than 12 percent of the rate charged by the operator, with the exact amount to be established by resolution of the city council. The amount of tax shall not be less than 10 percent of the rate charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator by the transient or the operator. [Ord. 11-1353 § 1, 2011; Ord. 869 § 1, 1985; 1937 Code § 170.2.]

3.12.040 Exemptions.
No tax shall be imposed upon any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided. [Ord. 11-1353 § 2, 2011; 1937 Code § 170.3.]

3.12.050 Operator’s duties.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. [1937 Code § 170.4.]

3.12.060 Hotel registration.
Within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or within 30 days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register the hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a “transient occupancy registration certificate” to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

A. The name of the operator;

B. The address of the hotel;

C. The date upon which the certificate was issued;

D. “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit.” [1937 Code § 170.5.]

3.12.070 Reporting and remitting.
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. [1937 Code § 170.6.]

3.12.080 Original delinquency.
Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. [1937 Code § 170.7(a).]

3.12.090 Continued delinquency.
Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the 10 percent penalty first imposed. [1937 Code § 170.7(b).]

3.12.100 Fraud.
If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in PMC 3.12.080 and 3.12.090. [1937 Code § 170.7(c).]

3.12.110 Interest.
In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. [Ord. 878 § 1, 1985; 1937 Code § 170.7(d).]

3.12.120 Penalties merged with tax.
Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of PMC 3.12.080 through 3.12.110 shall become a part of the tax required in this chapter to be paid. [1937 Code § 170.7(e).]

3.12.130 Collection and report failure – Determination of tax by tax administrator.
If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such a manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within 10 days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in PMC 3.12.140. [1937 Code § 170.8.]

3.12.140 Appeal.
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within 15 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. [1937 Code § 170.9.]

3.12.150 Records.
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. [1937 Code § 170.10.]

3.12.160 Refunds.
A. Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter it may be refunded as provided in subsections (B) and (C) of this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.

B. An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

C. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (A) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

D. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. [1937 Code § 170.11.]

3.12.170 Actions to collect.
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. [1937 Code § 170.12.]

B. For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

1. “City’s operating expenses” shall mean the city’s general fund operating expenses of the city as set forth in the city’s annual budget which generally includes staff costs and operating expenses of the city and excludes the capital project appropriations.

2. “One-time revenues” shall mean those revenues that the city receives on a one-time or nonregular basis. For example, such revenues may include, but are not limited to, proceeds from the sale of surplus land, one-time unexpected sales tax allocations associated with capital improvements from local retailers, grants, lump sum payments of project fees, nonreoccurring sales tax of fee revenue, etc.

3. “Unappropriated reserves” shall mean unappropriated operating revenues excluding capital project and program appropriations which originate from funding sources that are restricted to projects or programs. [Ord. 18-1455 § 2, 2018; Ord. 17-1432 § 2, 2017; Ord. 12-1363 § 2, 2013.]

3.26.020 General fund account.
There is established a “general fund” into which all sums of money collected by the city for any purpose whatsoever shall be deposited, unless otherwise provided by ordinance or resolution directing the deposit into a specific fund other than the general fund. [Ord. 18-1455 § 2, 2018; Ord. 17-1432 § 2, 2017; Ord. 12-1363 § 2, 2013.]

3.26.030 General fund reserves.
A. There is established within the general fund a “general fund reserve,” which shall be used for emergencies, including, for example, natural disasters and costs associated with such natural disasters.

B. At each and every budget cycle, commencing with fiscal year 2013-2014, and every year thereafter, money from the general fund shall be unappropriated, and shall be deposited into the general fund reserve. The minimum funding level within the general fund reserve shall be 30 percent of the city’s general fund operating expenses. However, the city council shall, on a best efforts basis, take such steps as necessary to achieve the minimum general fund reserve level during the budget process each year through fiscal year 2017-2018. Afterward, the minimum funding levels will become mandatory as defined by this chapter.

C. The 30 percent minimum funding level within the general fund reserve of the city’s general fund operating expenses shall consist of the following and be restricted as per the city’s policy:

• A reserve for economic uncertainty (20 percent of the 30 percent minimum funding level within the general fund reserve) – funds designated to mitigate periodic revenue shortfalls due to downturn in economic cycles, thereby avoiding the need for service-level reductions within the fiscal year; and

• An emergency reserve (10 percent of the 30 percent minimum funding level within the general fund reserve) – funds designated to mitigate costs of unforeseeable emergencies and natural disasters.

The composure of the reserves shall consist of:

1. A minimum of two-thirds of the 30 percent (i.e., 20 percent) shall be held in cash and liquid investments consistent with the city’s investment policy; and

2. An amount not to exceed one-third of the 30 percent (i.e., up to 10 percent) may be held in real property owned and designated by the city, where such real property has an appraised value of at least 125 percent of the dollar amount which the real property constitutes within the city’s general fund reserve.

D. Before the city sells, or otherwise encumbers in such a manner as to significantly impair the value of, any real property referenced in subsection (C)(2) of this section, the city shall comply with subsection (E) of this section and:

1. Identify replacement real property prior to the sale or encumbrance of the current designated property; provided, that the city council approves such replacement;

2. Direct proceeds from the sale or encumbrance of the current designated property into the general fund reserve to maintain the minimum required funding;

3. Increase the amount held in cash or liquid investments to maintain the minimum required funding; or

4. Take any combination of the above actions, such that the city maintains the minimum required funding.

5. Should the sale of any property result in the general fund reserve balance being greater than the 30 percent minimum funding level, the proceeds in excess of the 30 percent minimum funding level will be deposited into the budget stabilization fund or handled in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.

E. To designate real property as being held to satisfy the city’s minimum general fund reserve requirement under subsection (C)(2) of this section, the city shall identify the property by APN and/or address by a resolution adopted at a public hearing at a duly noticed regular city council meeting. The city may remove the real property from this designation only by a subsequent resolution adopted at a public hearing at a duly noticed regular city council meeting. [Ord. 18-1455 § 2, 2018; Ord. 17-1432 § 2, 2017; Ord. 12-1363 § 2, 2013.]

B. The target minimum funding level within the budget stabilization fund shall be no less than $2,000,000 or five percent of the city’s general fund operating expenses, whichever is greater. The city council shall, on a best efforts basis, take such steps as necessary to meet the minimum funding level during the budget process each year.

C. The target maximum funding level for the budget stabilization fund shall be no more than $7,500,000 or 25 percent of the annual city’s general fund operating expenses, whichever is greater.

D. Additional deposits into the budget stabilization fund shall include:

1. One-time general fund revenues and/or projected recurring revenues that exceed 10 percent or more from the previous fiscal year shall be deposited into the budget stabilization fund.

2. Fiscal year-end general fund surpluses shall also be deposited into the budget stabilization fund.

E. Appropriations from the budget stabilization fund require a majority vote of the city council and may be made in order to balance the general fund budget. [Ord. 18-1455 § 2, 2018; Ord. 17-1432 § 2, 2017; Ord. 12-1363 § 2, 2013.]

C. Appropriations from the infrastructure repair and replacement fund shall require a majority vote of the city council. [Ord. 18-1455 § 2, 2018; Ord. 17-1432 § 2, 2017; Ord. 12-1363 § 2, 2013.]

A. None of the license taxes provided for by this chapter shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitutions of the United States and the state.

B. In any case where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, he may apply to the director of finance for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be made before, at or within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show the method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the director of finance considers necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The director of finance shall then conduct an investigation, and, after having first obtained the written approval of the city attorney, may fix as the license tax for the applicant a lesser amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the license tax has already been paid, may order a partial refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the director of finance shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed is uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this chapter. Should the director of finance determine the gross receipts measure of license tax to be the proper basis, they may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant’s business in the city or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of license tax therefor; provided, that no additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the licensee has paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in this chapter.

The person shall, within 30 days after the expiration of the period for which the license was issued, furnish the director of finance with a sworn statement, upon a form to be provided by the director of finance, setting forth any required information and showing, during the period of the license, the gross receipts, the number of machines, devices or other applicable basis.

J. Any failure or refusal of licensee to timely make and file any required statements, or to pay any such fees or tax when the same are due and payable in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or to permit inspections of such books, records and accounts of such licensee, shall constitute full and sufficient grounds to revoke or suspend the license as provided in this chapter.

K. The amount of any business license fee, penalties and interest imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a civil debt to the city.

B.

If, upon review and consideration of the plan, the city council determines that the mechanisms and procedures contained in the plan are reasonably likely to satisfactorily address the adverse impacts upon which the suspension or revocation action was brought, the city council shall refrain from suspending or revoking the license, subject to prompt implementation by the licensee of the mechanisms and procedures contained in said plan. If upon implementation of such plan the city council determines that the adverse impacts have not been addressed and alleviated in a satisfactory manner, the council shall have the discretion to proceed with suspension or revocation of the license as provided in this chapter.

[Ord. 1102 § 20, 1995.]

5.24.210 Campaign contributions.
The city council finds that the gaming industry is a highly regulated and controlled industry due to the nature of its operations, the amount of money amassed and the fears and perceptions that some elements in the industry may use such funds to incur political debts from legislators who are aided by their contributions. In order to eliminate the appearance of impropriety associated with such contributions, the city council determines that it shall be unlawful for any corporation, partnership or other legal entity licensed under this chapter, or the licensee’s employees or agents or any pointholder, to make or cause to be made, either directly or indirectly, any monetary contributions to any elected official of the city, or any candidate seeking elected office within the city, or to their respective campaign organizations.

[Ord. 1102 § 23, 1995.]

5.24.240 Standard of review.

5.28.030 Nature and extent of grant.
A nonexclusive franchise granted under this chapter authorizes the grantee to engage in the business of constructing, operating and maintaining a cable system in the city and for that purpose to erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along any public street such poles, wires, cable, conductors, ducts, conduit, vaults, pedestals, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, attachments, and other property as may be necessary or useful and appurtenant to the cable system; and in addition, so to use, operate and provide similar facilities or properties rented or leased from a public entity franchised or permitted to do business in the city.

The grantee shall not, as to rates, charges, service, services, facilities, rules, regulations, or in any other respect, make or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person, nor subject any person to any prejudice or disadvantage, on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, ancestry or national origin. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.040 Territorial area involved.
A franchise granted by the city council under this chapter shall relate to the territorial limits of the city at the time of the franchise and to any area added during the term of the franchise. However, the grantee is not required to extend cable service to any newly annexed area until the newly annexed area has an average density of eight housing units per mile of street; and provided further, that the grantee is not required to provide service to any newly annexed area that is already receiving cable service or its equivalent. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.050 Duration of franchise – Termination.
A. Duration. No franchise granted under this chapter shall be for a term longer than 15 years from the date of the franchise agreement or the renewal of the agreement; provided, however, that the city council may in its discretion extend the term of a franchise then in effect for an additional term of not more than 10 years.

B. Termination. A franchise may be terminated by the city council before its date of expiration if the grantee fails or refuses to substantially comply with the city’s demand that a violation be corrected of any material provision, term, or condition of this chapter or any franchise of permit issued under this chapter. If the city deems the grantee to be in violation of any provision, term or condition of this chapter or any franchise issued under this chapter, the city shall make a written demand that the grantee correct the deficiency. If the violation continues for a period of 120 calendar days following the written demand without a correction or satisfactory assurance that the correction will be completed within a reasonable time, the city may place the issue of termination of the franchise before the city council. At least 20 calendar days before the date of council meeting, the city shall serve upon the grantee a written notice of intent to consider termination for failure to correct the violation, a statement of the nature and scope of the violation, and the time and place of the meeting. Public notice shall be given of the meeting and the issue which the council is to consider. The city council shall hear and consider the issue, shall hear any person interested in the issue, and shall determine whether or not the alleged violation has occurred. If the city council determines that a violation by the grantee has occurred, it shall also determine whether the violation is the fault of the grantee or was within the grantee’s reasonable control to correct. If the violation is the fault of the grantee and was within the grantee’s reasonable control to correct, the council may declare that the franchise of the grantee be terminated. The council’s decision to terminate the franchise may be reviewed by a court having jurisdiction, provided an action is commenced within 90 calendar days after the grantee receives written notice of the decision to terminate.

If any provision of this chapter becomes invalid or unenforceable because of superseding law, regulation or court decision, and if that provision constitutes a consideration material to the grantee of the franchise, then the parties may reconsider the franchise ordinance and agreement and make amendments mutually agreeable to the parties; provided, however, that any such amendment shall conform to and incorporate relevant provisions of state or federal law. [Ord. 1026A § 1, 1992; Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.060 Limitation upon grant.
No privileges or exemptions are granted or conferred by this chapter except those specifically prescribed in it. The franchise granted by this chapter is subordinate to any existing lawful public use or any existing franchise or lawful occupancy of any public street if such use, franchise or occupancy would be frustrated by the grantee’s proposed exercise of the rights granted to it by the franchise.

No franchise granted by this chapter may be sold, transferred, leased, assigned, or disposed of without the prior consent of the city expressed in writing, and then only under such conditions as may be prescribed in the consenting agreement; provided, however, that the city shall not unreasonably withhold consent; and provided further, that no such consent shall be required for any transfer in trust, mortgage or other hypothecation, as a whole, to secure an indebtedness.

If the grantee is a corporation, prior approval of the city council, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, is required where ownership or control of more than 30 percent of the voting stock of grantee is proposed to be acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own or control 30 percent or more of the voting stock, singularly or collectively. Further, acquisition of stock or equity to increase total ownership to an amount of 30 percent or greater by a person or group of persons acting in concert shall similarly require council approval. Any such acquisition occurring without prior approval of the city council constitutes failure to comply with a material provision of this chapter. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.070 Franchise acceptance.
No franchise granted under this chapter is effective until accepted by both parties. Such acceptance shall be evidenced by the execution of a franchise agreement. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.080 Regulation of rates and services.
A. FCC Regulations. The Federal Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (“the Act”) and the related regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) established regulations limiting rates for basic cable television service, as well as rates and changes for other ancillary services. The city adopts by reference the rate regulations established by the FCC pursuant to the Act, together with any amendments which may occur from time to time.

B. Initial Service Rates. Upon the city becoming certified by the FCC to enforce rate regulations, the city manager shall notify the grantee of the certification. Within 30 days after receipt of the notice, the grantee shall file its schedule of rates and charges for the basic service tier and associated equipment and ancillary rates with the city manager. Said schedule of rates shall be accompanied by a detailed explanation by the grantee of how the rates and charges are consistent with the FCC regulations.

C. Rate Increases. Prior to increasing any rates for basic service and/or associated equipment at any time, the grantee shall file its proposed rates with the city manager. Within seven days of filing its proposed rates, the grantee shall notify its subscribers of its proposed rates, and that written comments may be submitted to the city manager. Such notice shall contain language in substantially the following form:

The Federal Communications Commission provides regulations for the amount of fee increases. If the rates are consistent with such regulations, the City of Pittsburg has no power to disapprove them. The City Manager will determine whether the proposed rates are consistent with the regulations. Written comments on this matter may be directed to the City Manager at 2020 Railroad Avenue, Pittsburg, CA 94565 within twenty (20) days of your receipt of this notice.

D. Form of Applications. If the proposed rates are within the benchmark rates permitted by the FCC regulations, the grantee shall submit the required FCC form. If the proposed rates are greater than the benchmark rates permitted by FCC regulations, the grantee may submit a cost-of-service showing pursuant to FCC regulations. The city manager may request the grantee to submit such additional information as he may reasonably deem necessary to make a determination.

E. Action on Application. The city manager may approve, conditionally approve, or deny a rate increase. A conditional approval may be made pending further review of the rate increase. If the city manager determines from such further review or audit that the rate increase was not justified, a rate rollback or deduction may be ordered. In the event of any conditional approval or denial, the city manager shall submit a written explanation of such decision to the grantee. The city manager shall submit any decision made in writing to the grantee, and shall post such decision in the office of the city clerk and at the city council chambers. Such notice shall remain posted for at least 10 calendar days.

F. Appeal of Manager’s Decision. The grantee, or any interested person, may appeal the city manager’s decision to the city council. Such appeal, to be effective, must be filed with the city clerk in writing within 10 calendar days of the city manager’s decision.

G. Appeal of Council’s Decision. The grantee, or any interested person, may appeal the city council’s decision on appeal to the FCC in accordance with FCC regulations.

H. Complaints Regarding Premium Service Rates. Although the city has no jurisdiction over the rates charged for premium services, the city manager is authorized to file a complaint with the FCC challenging the reasonableness of a grantee’s rate for cable service or any other ancillary charges, at any time that the city manager determines that such complaint may be warranted. [Ord. 1084 § 1, 1994.]

5.28.090 Franchise payment.
During the term of its franchise, a grantee shall pay to the city a sum equal to five percent of the monthly total gross receipts of the grantee as defined in PMC 5.28.020, unless the fee is disapproved by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), in which case the grantee shall pay the amount authorized by the FCC. The payment by the grantee to the city shall be paid semiannually and shall be in lieu of any occupation tax, license tax or similar levy. Grantee may not deduct from the payment any possessory interest tax or similar levy assessed to the grantee. The amount of the franchise fee payment shall not be included in the calculation of rate adjustments under PMC 5.28.080(B) unless the rate includes the amount of the franchise fee payment.

The grantee shall file with the city, within 90 calendar days after the expiration of any calendar year during which such franchise is in force, a financial statement prepared by a certified public accountant showing in detail the total gross receipts of grantee during the preceding calendar year. Grantee shall pay to the city within 15 calendar days after the time for filing such statements any unpaid balance for the calendar year covered by the statements.

The city has the right to inspect the grantee’s records showing its gross receipts, subject to PMC 5.28.210. [Ord. 1026A § 2, 1992; Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.100 Rights-of-way.
A. Any privilege claimed by the grantee under the franchise in any street or other public property is subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of the streets or other public property and shall be in conformance with Section 53066 et seq. of the California Government Code.

B. The grantee is subject to all requirements of the municipal code, rules, regulations and specifications of the city enacted or established before or after this chapter takes effect, including those concerning street work, street excavations, use, removal and relocation of property within a street, and other street work, so long as any rule, regulation, or specification enacted after the effective date of this chapter does not materially increase the obligations or burdens assumed by the grantee under this chapter. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.110 Rights reserved to the city.
There is hereby reserved to the city every right and power which is required to be reserved or provided by any ordinance of the city. The grantee, by its acceptance of any franchise, agrees to be bound by it and to comply with any action or requirement of the city in its exercise of such right or power enacted or established before or after this chapter takes effect, that does not materially increase the obligations or burdens assumed by the grantee. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.120 Permits and authorizations.
The grantee shall proceed within 30 calendar days with due diligence to obtain all necessary permits and authorizations which are required in the conduct of its business, including utility joint use attachment agreements and microwave carrier licenses to be granted by duly constituted regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the operation of cable systems or associated microwave transmission facilities. Further, the grantee shall commence the installation within 90 calendar days after having obtained all the necessary permits and authorizations. Subject to the provisions of PMC 5.28.130, grantee shall proceed to render service to subscribers within 90 calendar days following the commencement of installation of the system. Grantee shall pursue the completion of the installation with reasonable diligence thereafter, so that service to all areas designated on the map accompanying the application for franchise shall be provided within one year from the date that service was first provided. Substantial noncompliance with the foregoing requirements shall be grounds for termination of the franchise, unless such noncompliance is due to circumstances or occurrences beyond the grantee’s reasonable control. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.130 Location of property of grantee.
The grantee shall make appropriate arrangements to install cable system facilities with the owner of the property or easement where facilities are to be located. The grantee is not required to pay a fee, or to compensate in any fashion, the owner in order to obtain permission to locate cable system facilities above, below, on or across the owner’s property or easement, nor is grantee required to provide cable service to properties in the vicinity of the owner’s property or easement. Furthermore, if the owner refuses to permit the grantee to locate cable system facilities above, below, on or across the property or easement, the grantee is not required to serve properties in the vicinity by means of an alternative route for the installation of cable system facilities if use of the alternative route would result in construction costs above those which would have been necessary if permission had been granted.

All excavation work performed by grantee within the streets requires an excavation permit. Any poles, wires, cable lines, conduits or other properties of the grantee to be constructed or installed in streets shall be so constructed or installed only at the locations and in the manner as are approved by the city acting in the exercise of its authority and reasonable discretion.

The grantee shall post a cash bond or line of credit from a federal or state of California bank or savings and loan association in the name of the city in the amount of $50,000 for use by the city to repair, replace or restore streets or other public facilities damaged by the grantee’s work. The city has the right to withdraw sufficient funds for such repairs following 15 calendar days’ written notice to the grantee that such repairs are necessary and the grantee’s failure to perform necessary repair. Upon such withdrawals, the grantee shall replenish the bond to its full original amount. Interest from the cash bond shall be reserved to the grantee on terms and conditions approved by the city manager.

The grantee shall not install or erect any facilities or apparatus in or on public streets or rights-of-way or within any privately owned area within the city, except those installed or erected upon public utility facilities now existing, without obtaining the prior written approval of the city manager.

In those areas of the city where the transmission or distribution facilities of the public utilities providing telephone service and electric service are underground or may be placed underground in the future, the grantee shall likewise construct, operate and maintain all of its facilities underground to the extent that the facilities of the existing utilities are underground. For the purpose of this section, “underground” includes a partial underground system. The city is not responsible for any of the grantee’s costs in placing its facilities underground.

The entire cable system of the grantee shall be located or relocated and so erected as not to interfere unreasonably with travel over, in, on or under any street and with reasonable ingress and egress to abutting property. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.140 Removal or abandonment of franchise property.
If (1) the use of any franchise property is discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months, unless such discontinuance is due to circumstances beyond the grantee’s reasonable control; (2) franchise property has been installed in any street without substantially complying with the requirements of this chapter; or (3) the franchise has been terminated or has expired; grantee, at its sole expense, shall promptly remove all franchise property which the city manager may reasonably require to be removed. After removal, grantee shall promptly restore the street or public property from which the franchise property has been removed to a satisfactory condition. All other franchise property shall be deemed abandoned in place and shall become the sole property of the city without any liens or encumbrances on it. Upon abandonment of any franchise property in place, grantee shall submit to the city manager an instrument, satisfactory in form to the city attorney, transferring to city the ownership of the abandoned franchise property. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.150 Change required by public improvements.
The grantee shall at its expense protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate in the same street or remove from the street any of its property when required by the city engineer because of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, or installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks or any other type of structures or improvements by public or semipublic agencies. In such cases, the grantee has the privileges and is subject to the obligations of abandoning any of its property in place as provided in PMC 5.28.140. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.160 Failure to perform street work.
Upon the failure of the grantee to complete any work required by law or by this chapter to be done in any street within the time prescribed, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the city engineer, the city engineer may, after reasonable notice to grantee, cause such work to be done, and the grantee shall pay to the city the cost in the itemized amounts reported by the city engineer to the grantee within 30 calendar days after receipt of the itemized report. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.170 Cable system installation shielding.
The grantee shall properly and in a good workmanlike manner, install and maintain adequate shielding, filtering and grounding at affected installations within the cable system to eliminate television interference encountered from fundamental frequency overload by radio amateur transmissions which are in compliance with Federal Communications Commission regulations. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.180 Faithful performance bond.
A. In addition to the cash bond or credit required by PMC 5.28.130 the grantee shall, concurrently with the filing of an acceptance of award of any franchise granted under this chapter, file with the city clerk and maintain for the term of the franchise a corporate surety bond in a company approved by, and in a form to be approved by, the city attorney, in the amount of $50,000. The bond shall be renewable annually and conditioned upon the faithful performance of grantee, and upon the further condition that if grantee fails to comply with provisions of this chapter or of any franchise issued to the grantee there shall be recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the grantee which may be in default, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney’s fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. This condition is a continuing obligation during the franchise and thereafter until the grantee has liquidated all of its obligations with the city that may have arisen from the franchise. The bond shall provide that the city be given 30 calendar days’ prior written notice of intention not to renew, cancellation or material change. The bond requirement may be satisfied by an irrevocable letter of credit maintained with a bank which may similarly be assessed by the city.

B. Neither the provisions of this section, any bond or letter of credit, nor any damages recovered by the city shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee or limit the liability of the grantee under the franchise or limit liability for damages, either to the full amount of the bond or letter of credit or otherwise. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.190 Indemnification of the city.
A. The grantee shall maintain and file with the city a general comprehensive liability insurance policy from a company approved by the city manager and in such form as the city attorney reasonably requires, protecting the city and all persons against liability for loss or damage for personal injury, death and property damage arising from the operations of grantee under the franchise. The policy shall have minimum liability limits of $500,000 for personal injury or death to any one person, and $1,000,000 for personal injury or death of two or more persons in any one occurrence, and $100,000 for damage to property resulting from any one occurrence.

B. The policies required under subsection (A) of this section shall name the city, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees as insureds, and shall contain a provision that a written notice of any cancellation or reduction in coverage of the policy shall be delivered to the city at least 20 calendar days before the effective date thereof. If the insurance is provided by a policy which also covers grantee or any entity or person other than those above named, then the policy shall contain the standard cross-liability endorsement.

C. No franchise granted under this chapter is effective unless insurance policies required in this section have been delivered to the city. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.200 Hold harmless agreement.
Grantee shall indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees against and from any and all claims, demands, causes of actions, actions, suits, proceedings, damage (including but not limited to damages to city property and damages arising out of copyright infringements, and damages arising out of any failure by grantee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered by grantee’s cable system), costs or liabilities (including costs or liabilities of the city with respect to its employees), of every kind and nature whatsoever, including but not limited to damages for injury or death or damage to person or property, and regardless of the merit of any of the same, and against all liability to others, and against any loss, cost, and expense resulting or arising out of any of the same including any attorney fees, accountant fees, expert witness or consultant fees, court costs per diem expense, traveling and transportation expense, or other costs or expenses arising out of or pertaining to the exercise or the enjoyment of any franchise by grantee or the granting thereof by the city.

Grantee shall, at the sole risk and expense of grantee, upon written demand of the city made by the city attorney, appear in and defend any suit, action, or other legal proceedings, whether judicial, quasi-judicial, administrative, legislative, or otherwise, brought or instituted or had by third persons or duly constituted authorities against or affecting the city, its officers, boards, commissions, agents or employees, and arising out of or pertaining to the exercise or enjoyment of the franchise.

Grantee shall pay and satisfy or shall cause to be paid and satisfied any judgment, decree, order, directive, or demand rendered, made or issued against grantee, the city, its officers, boards, commissions, agents, or employees in any of these premises; and such indemnity shall exist and continue without reference to or limitation by the amount of any bond, policy of insurance, deposit, undertaking or other assurance required hereunder, or otherwise; provided, that neither grantee nor city shall make or enter into any compromise, suit or other proceedings, without first obtaining the written consent of the other.

This section shall not apply to indemnity the city against its own wilful misconduct or sole negligence. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.210 Inspection of property and records.
At all reasonable times the grantee shall permit any duly authorized representative of the city to examine all grantee’s property situated within or without the city and to examine and copy any maps and other records maintained by the grantee or under its control which deal with the operations, affairs, transactions or property of the grantee with respect to its compliance with the franchise. This permission is contingent upon the provisions that: (1) the city shall maintain the confidentiality of any trade secrets or other proprietary information in the grantee’s possession; and (2) records shall be exempt from inspection under this section to the extent required by applicable laws regarding subscriber privacy and to the extent such records are protected by law against discovery in civil litigation.

The grantee shall make and keep in the city complete plans and records showing the exact location of all cable system equipment installed or in use in streets and public places in the city. The grantee shall file with the city engineer on or before the last day in March of each year a current map or set of maps drawn to scale to be designated by the city engineer showing all cable system equipment installed in streets and public places of the city during the previous year.

Factors to be considered by the parties in determining economic feasibility and developments of cable system technology include:

1. The remaining term of the franchise;

2. Performance demonstrating the operational feasibility of any new service;

3. Construction or other directly related costs;

4. The adaptability of the service to the existing cable system facilities; and

5. Potential marketability of the service. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

The city manager has no powers, duties or responsibilities with respect to the censorship of program contents, whether as to off-air broadcast carriage or locally originated programming.

C. During the fifth and tenth years of franchise, the city council may require the grantee to submit a report describing the grantee’s compliance with PMC 5.28.220 and 5.28.230 and comparing its system design and technical performance with that of other cable systems with a similar number of subscribers or with systems in adjacent communities. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

5.28.260 Emergency override.
The cable system shall include an emergency alert capability which shall permit the grantee, upon the direction of the appropriate emergency service commander, to override the audio, or to display a video message, on all television signals simultaneously in the case of public emergencies.

The city may not base a denial of renewal on failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under subsection (C)(1)(a) of this section or on events considered under subsection (C)(1)(b) of this section unless the city has provided the grantee with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the city has waived its right to object, or has effectively acquiesced.

2. The court shall grant appropriate relief if it finds:

a. An action of the city is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this section; or

b. In the event of a final decision of the city denying the renewal proposal, the grantee has demonstrated that the adverse finding of the city with respect to each of the factors described in subsections (C)(1)(a) through (d) of this section on which the denial is based is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence based on the record of the proceeding conducted under subsection (C) of this section.

F. In this section the term “franchise expiration” means the date of the expiration of the term of the franchise under the franchise agreement.

G. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this section, the grantee may submit a proposal for the renewal of a franchise at any time and the city may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny the proposal at any time including after proceedings pursuant to this section have commenced. The provisions of subsections (A) through (F) of this section shall not apply to a decision to grant or deny a proposal under this subsection (G). The denial of a renewal under this subsection (G) shall not affect action on a renewal proposal that is submitted in accordance with subsections (A) through (F) of this section. [Ord. 907 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986.]

A public agency other than the city may, at any time during the term of the franchise, construct, maintain and use public improvements over, on, in or under the city street in which the grantee’s franchise property is located.

If construction, maintenance or repair by the city or a public agency mentioned in the preceding paragraph necessitates the relocation, temporary removal or adjustment of the franchise property, the grantee shall pay the cost.

The city or the public agency whose work necessitates the relocation or adjustment of the franchise property shall give at least 10 days’ advance written notice to the grantee of the fact that it proposes to engage in work which will interfere with the franchise property. The notice shall specify the general nature and location of the work and shall direct the grantee to take all necessary steps to protect his franchise property. The city or the public agency may order the grantee to temporarily disconnect or remove, relocate or readjust its franchise property to the extent and in the manner necessary to permit the performance of the construction by the city or public agency. [Ord. 605 C.S. § 10, 1970.]

5.40.110 Additional authority.
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city from awarding a franchise to a grantee under the authority of the Franchise Act of 1937, as amended (Public Utilities Code Sections 6201 et seq.) (the “Franchise Act”). The Franchise Act represents independent authority for granting a franchise. The terms of PMC 5.40.010 through 5.40.100 shall only be applicable to a franchise granted under the Franchise Act if specifically set forth in the ordinance granting the franchise, as may be allowed by applicable law. [Ord. 1074 § 13, 1993.]

Article I. Medical Cannabis

5.70.010 Purpose.
A. In enacting this article, it is the intent of the city council of the city of Pittsburg to protect the safety and welfare of the general public. The Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. Section 841, prohibits the possession, sale and distribution of cannabis, and the city council finds that sanctioning the opening or establishment of medical cannabis collectives, cooperatives and dispensaries, or allowing the delivery of medical cannabis within the city, would be inconsistent with federal law. However, the city acknowledges that state law allows commercial medical cannabis businesses, and that certain commercial medical cannabis businesses that operate in accordance with state law and are properly vetted, regulated, and monitored can have positive economic impacts in the communities in which they operate.

B. Furthermore, the city council finds that medical cannabis dispensaries are public nuisances in that many violent crimes have been committed that can be traced back to the proliferation of cannabis dispensaries, including armed robberies and murders. Increased noise and pedestrian traffic, including nonresidents in pursuit of cannabis, and out-of-area criminals in search of prey, are commonly encountered near or outside cannabis collectives, cooperatives and dispensaries. The city council further finds that it is reasonable to conclude that medical cannabis deliveries are likely to cause many of these same adverse impacts.

C. Therefore, in order to protect the integrity of the city and the goals upon which this city was founded, the city council finds that it is in the best interest of the residents of the city to prohibit medical cannabis collectives, cooperatives and dispensaries, and medical cannabis deliveries, and only allow certain commercial medical cannabis businesses to operate, subject to specific permitting requirements and execution of an operating agreement.

D. The purpose of this article is to prohibit medical cannabis collectives, cooperatives and dispensaries from being opened or established in the city of Pittsburg, as well as prohibiting medical cannabis deliveries from occurring in the city of Pittsburg, while also allowing certain commercial medical cannabis businesses to operate subject to requirements set forth in this article. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to allow or authorize any use or activity which is otherwise prohibited by any state or federal law. [Ord. 18-1442 § 3 (Exh.

Article II. Nonmedical Cannabis

5.70.110 Purpose.
A. In enacting this article, it is the intent of the city council to protect the safety and welfare of the general public. The Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. Section 841, prohibits the possession, sale and distribution of cannabis, and the city council finds that sanctioning the opening or establishment of nonmedical cannabis collectives, cooperatives, and dispensaries, or allowing the delivery of nonmedical cannabis within the city would be inconsistent with federal law. However, the city acknowledges that state law allows commercial nonmedical cannabis businesses, and that certain commercial nonmedical cannabis businesses that operate in accordance with state law and are properly vetted, regulated, and monitored, can have positive economic impacts in the communities in which they operate.

B. Furthermore, the city council finds that nonmedical cannabis dispensaries are public nuisances in that many violent crimes have been committed that can be traced back to the proliferation of cannabis dispensaries, including armed robberies and murders. Increased noise and pedestrian traffic, including nonresidents in pursuit of cannabis, and out-of-area criminals in search of prey, are commonly encountered near or outside cannabis collectives, cooperatives and dispensaries.

D. The purpose of this article is to prohibit cannabis collectives, cooperatives and dispensaries from being opened or established in the city of Pittsburg, as well as prohibiting nonmedical cannabis deliveries from occurring in the city of Pittsburg, while also allowing certain commercial nonmedical cannabis businesses to operate subject to requirements set forth in this article. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to allow or authorize any use or activity which is otherwise prohibited by any state or federal law. [Ord. 18-1442 § 3 (Exh.

Article I. General Provisions

8.06.010 Findings and purpose.
A. Existing landfill space for the disposal of municipal solid waste is rapidly diminishing. The California Integrated Solid Waste Management Act now mandates 25 percent landfill diversion by 1995 and 50 percent landfill diversion by the year 2000. (Public Resources Code Section 41780). The recycling of recyclable materials will help postpone the need for new landfill capacity, help the city meet its mandatory landfill diversion quotas and also reduce pollution and loss of resources which occurs when perfectly usable materials are discarded.

B. Take-out food packaging constitutes a significant and growing portion of the material in the city’s waste stream. An additional concern is that much of the nonrecyclable take-out food packaging is made of polystyrene foam in which chlorofluorocarbons (“CFCs”) were used as a blowing agent in the manufacturing process. Available scientific evidence indicates a strong probability that CFCs, when discharged into the atmosphere, degrade the earth’s ozone layer. There are substitutes for these polystyrene take-out food packaging products which do not use CFCs in their manufacture. Requiring that take-out food packaging be made of non-CFC processed material be recyclable, reusable or made of recycled materials is an essential part of an effective integrated solid waste management program for the citizens of the city and others working or doing business in the city.

C. The health, welfare and safety of the people in the city are promoted by the use of returnable or recyclable materials in take-out food packaging and by the city-wide collection of recyclable waste materials. The purpose of this chapter is to mandate the collection and recycling of recyclable waste materials, establish a curbside recycling program to aid this requirement, and to reduce the use of take-out food packaging which is not reusable or recyclable. [Ord. 1019 § 1, 1991.]

8.10.050 CalGreen requirements.
The city will apply California Green Building Standards Code (CalGreen) standards that requires a percentage by weight of job site debris generated by most types of building project types be recycled, reused, or otherwise diverted from landfill disposal. This requirement applies to demolition projects and most new construction, as well as the majority of building additions or alterations. The recycled, reused, or otherwise diverted materials and requirements will comply with adopted CalGreen standards. CalGreen requires submission of plans and reports with verifiable post-project documentation to demonstrate that at least 65 percent of the nonhazardous construction and demolition (C&D) debris generated on the job site is salvaged for reuse, recycled or otherwise diverted. [Ord. 19-1461 § 2, 2019.]

8.10.060 Threshold for covered projects.
A. Covered Projects. All construction and renovation, residential and nonresidential, projects within the city, the total costs of which are, or are projected to be, greater than or equal to $100,000, or which involve the construction of projects 2,500 square feet or larger (“covered projects”), shall comply with this subsection (A). All demolition projects regardless of value shall comply with this section. All roofing or re-roofing projects valued at $10,000 or greater or a project where 50 percent or more of the roof areas is re-roofed, or where a project requires five squares or more of roofing material regardless of permit value, shall comply with this section. For the purposes of determining whether a project meets the foregoing thresholds, all phases of a project and all related projects taking place on a single and any adjoining parcel, as determined by the WMP compliance official, shall be deemed a single project.

B. Exempt Projects. Applicants for construction and renovation projects within the city which are not covered projects (“exempt projects”) shall divert as much project-related construction and demolition debris as possible as set forth in PMC 8.06.040, Mandatory duty to recycle – Penalties. Immediate or emergency demolition required to protect the public health, safety or welfare, as determined by a public safety official or code compliance officer, shall also be considered an exempt project.

C. Building and Demolition Permits. No building, site development or demolition permit shall be issued for a covered project unless and until the WMP compliance official has approved a WMP for the project. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be listed as a condition of approval on any building, site development or demolition permit issued for a covered project.

D. Projects Sponsored by the City or Successor Agency. All construction, demolition and renovation projects sponsored by the city or successor agency shall be considered covered projects for the purposes of this chapter. The project sponsor shall submit a WMP to the WMP compliance official prior to beginning any activities and shall be subject to all applicable provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 19-1461 § 2, 2019.]

If an applicant for a covered project experiences unique circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for an exemption at the time that he or she submits the WMP required under PMC 8.10.070. Increased costs to the applicant will not be a sufficient basis for an exemption unless such costs are extraordinary. The applicant shall indicate on the WMP the maximum amount of diversion he or she concludes is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances that he or she concludes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement.

B. Meeting with WMP Compliance Official. The WMP compliance official shall review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement. Upon request of the city, the WMP compliance official may request staff attend this meeting or may require the applicant to request a separate meeting with staff. Based on the information supplied by the applicant and, if applicable, staff and the WMP compliance official shall determine whether it is feasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement.

C. Granting of Exemption. If the WMP compliance official determines that it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to unique circumstances, he or she shall establish a minimum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the WMP submitted by the applicant. The WMP compliance official shall return a copy of the WMP to the applicant marked “Approved for Infeasible Exemption.”

D. Denial of Exemption. If the WMP compliance official determines that it is feasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement, he or she shall so inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall have 30 days to resubmit a WMP form in full compliance with PMC 8.10.070. If the applicant fails to resubmit the WMP, or if the resubmitted WMP does not comply with PMC 8.10.070, the WMP compliance official shall deny the WMP. [Ord. 19-1461 § 2, 2019.]

8.10.120 Appeal.
The applicant may appeal the denial of application for infeasibility exemption or denial of WMP decision to the city pursuant to this chapter in accordance with Chapter 1.08 PMC et seq. The matter shall be heard by a hearing officer and shall be limited to (A) the granting or denial of an infeasibility exemption or (B) a noncompliance determination. Notice of any appeal from the applicant from the ruling of the WMP compliance official must be filed with the community development director within 10 days of the date that such ruling is made. The decision of the hearing officer upon such appeal shall be final and shall not be appealable to the city council or to any other city body or official. [Ord. 19-1461 § 2, 2019.]

8.10.130 Submittal of completed waste management plan.
A. Documentation. No permit or approvals related to the project site shall be issued by the city until the applicant complies with the provisions of this section. The completed WMP must be approved prior to final occupancy.

The applicant shall submit documentation to the WMP compliance official along with a completed WMP that documents the diversion requirement for the project has been met in order to receive final occupancy approval or final demolition permits. This documentation shall include the following:

1. The completed WMP submitted for approval shall list for each construction and demolition material type generated, the actual material by weight the project generated, and receipts from both the disposal and recycling facilities and/or licensed haulers that received each material showing clearly whether the material was disposed or recycled;

2. Any additional information the applicant deems is relevant to determining its efforts to comply in good faith with this chapter.

B. Weighing of Wastes. Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all construction and demolition debris diverted or landfilled are measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all construction and demolition debris shall be weighed by measurement on scales. Such scales shall follow all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition debris for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose.

C. Determination of Compliance and Release of Permit. The WMP compliance official shall review the information submitted under subsection (A) of this section and determine whether the applicant has complied with the diversion requirement, as follows:

1. Full Compliance. If the WMP compliance officer determines that the applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirement applicable to the project, he or she shall indicate such compliance on the WMP.

2. Good Faith Effort to Comply. If the WMP compliance official determines that the diversion requirement has not been achieved, he or she shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter. In making this determination, the WMP compliance official shall consider the availability of markets for the C&D debris landfilled, the size of the project, and the documented efforts of the applicant to divert C&D debris. If the WMP compliance official determines that the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, he or she shall so indicate on the WMP.

3. Noncompliance. If the WMP compliance official determines that the applicant has not made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by subsection (A) of this section within the required time period, then the applicant shall be in violation of this chapter and be liable for a civil penalty, and may be subject to any other remedy provided by this chapter. No certificates of occupancy or other permits or approvals relating to the project site shall be issued by the city until the civil penalty has been paid in full. [Ord. 19-1461 § 2, 2019.]

If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land within such 10-day period, the statement shall be construed as a request for hearing which does not require his presence. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed, by registered mail, at least 10 days before the hearing to the owner of the land and to the owner of the vehicle, unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership. If such a request for hearing is not received within 10 days after mailing of the notice of intention to abate and remove, the city shall have the authority to abate and remove the vehicle, or parts thereof, as a public nuisance without holding a public hearing.

The city council finds that:

A. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has determined that tobacco smoke is the major contributor of particulate indoor air pollution; and

B. Reliable studies have shown that breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard, in particular for elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function; including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease; and

C. Health hazards induced by breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke include heart disease, lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise tolerance, decreased respiratory function, bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm; and

D. Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who suffer other ill effects of breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of adverse reactions to same; and

E. The smoking of tobacco, or any other weed or plant, is a danger to health; and

F. The health care costs and lost productivity incurred by smoking-related disease and death represent a heavy and avoidable financial drain on our community; and

G. The free distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco products encourages people to begin smoking and using tobacco products, and tempts those who had quit smoking to begin smoking again; and

H. Free distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco products promotes unsightly litter, thereby increasing the costs to the public in cleaning the streets; and also causes pedestrian traffic congestion; and

I. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has determined that some electronic cigarettes, which deliver an inhalable dose of nicotine or other chemicals by vaporized solution, contain carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as diethylene glycol, an ingredient used in antifreeze; and

J. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the safety and efficacy of electronic cigarettes has not been fully studied, and for that reason non-users of electronic cigarettes exposed to smoke or vapor from electronic cigarettes have no way of knowing whether or to what extent such exposure is safe; and

K. The use of electronic cigarettes in public places and places of employment complicates efforts to enforce and comply with smoke-free regulations; and

L. Smoking is initiated and established primarily during adolescence, where nearly nine out of 10 smokers started smoking by age 18, and 99 percent started by age 26; and

M. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of students in grades 6 through 12 reporting having ever used an e-cigarette doubled from 3.3 percent to 6.8 percent from 2011 to 2012. [Ord. 14-1382 § 2, 2014; Ord. 1098 § 1, 1995; Ord. 1087 § 2, 1994.]

9.08.010 Purpose.
The display of drug and narcotic paraphernalia in business establishments, open to the public and frequented by minors, tends to induce acquisition and use by minors for smoking, injecting or consumption of controlled substances. Possession and use of controlled substances are prohibited or limited by the Controlled Substances Act, California Health and Safety Code, Section 11000, et seq. It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to eliminate the exposure of minors to such devices and, thereby, curb the sale to and use of illicit and harmful drugs and narcotics to and by minors in the interests of their mental and physical health. [Ord. 788 § 1, 1980.]

9.08.020 Minors.
No owner, manager, proprietor or other person in charge of any room in any place of business selling, or displaying for the purpose of sale, any device, contrivance, instrument or paraphernalia used, altered or modified for the purpose of smoking, injecting or consuming marijuana, hashish, PCP, or any controlled substance, as defined in the Health and Safety Code of the State of California, other than prescription drugs, as well as roach clips and rollers designed for the smoking of the foregoing, shall allow or permit any person under the age of 18 years to be, remain in, enter or visit such room unless such minor person is accompanied by one of his or her parents, or by his or her legal guardian. [Ord. 788 § 1, 1980.]

9.08.030 Minors – Excluded.
A person under the age of 18 years shall not be, remain in, enter or visit any room in any place used for the sale or displaying for sale devices, contrivances, instruments or paraphernalia used, altered or modified for the purpose of smoking, injecting or consuming marijuana, hashish, PCP, or any controlled substance, other than prescription drugs and devices to ingest or inject prescription drugs, including roach clips and rollers designed and used for smoking the foregoing, unless such person is accompanied by one of his or her parents or his or her legal guardian. [Ord. 788 § 1, 1980.]

9.08.040 Sale and display rooms.
A person shall not maintain, in any place of business to which the public is invited, the display for sale or the offering to sell of devices, contrivances, instruments, or paraphernalia used, altered or modified for the purpose of smoking, injecting or consuming marijuana, hashish, PCP, or any controlled substance, other than prescription drugs and devices to ingest or inject prescription drugs, including roach clips, and rollers designed and used for the smoking of the foregoing, unless within a separate room or enclosure to which minors not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian are excluded. Each entrance to such a room shall be a sign posted in visible and legible words to the effect that minors unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian are excluded. For the purposes of this section, an “enclosure” shall mean an area of a room separated in such a manner that no material regulated by this section shall be visible from any area of the room open to minors. [Ord. 788 § 1, 1980.]

9.08.050 Sale and display rooms – Nuisance.
The distribution or possession for the purpose of sale, exhibition, or display in any place of business from which minors are not excluded as set forth in this section, and where devices, contrivances, instruments or paraphernalia used, altered or modified for the purpose of smoking, injecting, or consuming marijuana, hashish, PCP, or any controlled substance, other than prescription drugs and devices to ingest or inject prescription drugs, including roach clips and rollers designed and used for smoking the foregoing, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, and may be abated pursuant to the provisions of Section 731 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of California.

9.24.010 Purpose.
False alarms pose a hazard to police officers and the general public, divert police officers from useful duties and therefore cause a waste of police services. The purpose of this chapter is to reduce or eliminate the incident of false alarms. [Ord. 867 § 1, 1985.]

9.24.020 Definitions.
A. “Alarm agent” means a person employed by an alarm company operator whose duties include selling on premises, altering, installing, maintaining, moving, repairing, replacing, servicing, responding or monitoring an alarm system, or a person who manages or supervises the duties described. “Alarm company operator” means a person who engages in business or accepts employment to install, maintain, alter, sell on premises, monitor, or service alarm systems or who responds to alarm systems (except for an alarm agent). “Alarm company operator,” however, does not include a business which merely sells on premises, monitors, or responds to alarm systems at the protected premises.

B. “Alarm systems” means equipment which is intended to notify persons of an emergency requiring urgent attention and to which police are expected to respond. The term “alarm system” includes equipment which is designed to (1) detect an emergency, or (2) to be activated by a person to report an emergency.

C. “Alarm user” means (1) a person who owns or is entitled to possession of any premises on which an alarm system has been installed; or (2) a person subscribing or contracting with an alarm business for the leasing, servicing or monitoring of an alarm system. In the case of corporate or other users which are not natural persons, the natural person who has a managerial responsibility for the premises where the alarm is located shall be deemed the “alarm user.” “Alarm user” includes a county, school district and any other public corporation or district.

D. “Audible alarm” means an alarm system which, when activated, generates a sound which is audible outside the structure where the system is located.

E. “Central station alarm system” means an alarm system which, when activated, generates a signal or transmission to a station outside the structure where the alarm was generated (which station then notifies Delta Regional Communications Center of the alarm).

F. “Emergency” means a situation which poses an immediate threat to persons or property. An “emergency” includes an unlawful entry onto premises or an attempted unlawful entry, the commission of a crime, the existence of a fire, or the occurrence of a serious medical problem.

G. “False alarm” means an activated alarm or alarm signal from any alarm which is responded to by the police department but for which no emergency situation exists or where there is no evidence to indicate that there was an emergency situation as determined by the responding officer.

False alarms are excessive if, after written notice from the police department that the system has generated a false alarm, the system then generates two or more false alarms within any 30-day period within a year. Any number of false alarms within a 24-hour period, however, are deemed one false alarm under this chapter. [Ord. 993 § 1, 1990; Ord. 867 § 1, 1985.]

9.24.030 Exemptions.
Unless otherwise stated, this chapter does not apply to the following:

A. An alarm on an automobile, boat, boat trailer, house trailer, or recreational vehicle;

B. A fire alarm;

1. A severe storm or earthquake or other violent act of nature; or

2. The interruption of telephone service between premises (“trouble status alarm”). [Ord. 867 § 1, 1985.]

9.24.040 Registration of alarm agents.
A. Under Business and Professions Code Section 7592 et seq., each alarm agent is required to register with the Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Collection and Investigative Services.

B. An alarm agent doing business in the city shall register his name with the police department and file a copy of his state identification card. No fee is charged for registration in the city. [Ord. 867 § 1, 1985.]

9.24.050 Requirements – Registration – Technical standards – Posting.
A. Registration and Alarm Systems. An alarm user shall register his alarm system with the police department at least 24-hours before the system is activated.

1. Information. An alarm user shall provide registration information on a form provided by the city. The information shall include the names and telephone numbers of at least two persons who can respond to the premises where the alarm occurred. A subscriber to a central station alarm system shall also provide the two names and phone numbers to that central system.

2. Prior Installations. An alarm user whose alarm system was installed before the effective date of this chapter shall register the alarm system within 90 days, or 15 days after notification of the registration requirement by the city, whichever is sooner.

B. Technical Standards.

1. Backup Power Supply. Each alarm system shall be supplied with a backup power supply in such a manner that the interruption or failure of the normal utility electric service will not activate the alarm system. The backup power supply must be capable of operating for at least four hours. The transfer of power must occur in a manner which does not activate the alarm.

2. Automatic Deactivation of Audible Alarms. Each audible alarm system shall be designed to deactivate the sound within 30 minutes. An audible alarm system which has a cutoff and a rearming phase must be able to distinguish between an open and closed circuit. If the circuit is broken, the system must be designed so that it will not rearm.

3. Prior Installations. An alarm user whose alarm system was installed before the effective date of this chapter shall comply with these technical standards within six months after receiving notice from the city.

C. Posting. If an alarm user with an audible alarm has contracted with an alarm company for continuous monitoring service, the alarm user shall post the 24-hour contact phone number in a conspicuous place readable from ground level. [Ord. 983 § 1, 1990; Ord. 867 § 1, 1985.]

9.24.060 Prohibitions.
A. No person may install or operate an audible alarm system which emits a sound similar to that of an emergency siren or civil defense warning system. This excludes yelps, warbles and bells.

B. No person shall install, use or maintain an alarm system which automatically selects a city, police department or other public agency telephone number and plays a prerecorded message to report an emergency without the agency’s prior written consent.

C. No person shall install, use or maintain an alarm system or operate, manage, maintain or use the premises on which the alarm system is located in any manner which causes the alarm system to generate excessive false alarms. [Ord. 867 § 1, 1985.]

9.24.070 Enforcement.
A. It is an infraction for a person to violate or fail to comply with this chapter. An infraction is punishable by:

1. A fine not exceeding $50.00 for a first violation;

2. A fine not exceeding $75.00 for a second violation of the same ordinance within one year;

3. A fine not exceeding $100.00 for each additional violation of the same ordinance within one year.

B. In addition to the penalty in subsection (A) of this section and if there are excessive false alarms at a premises, the chief of police may place the premises on “probationary, low priority response status” or on “no response” status after written notification to the alarm user. [Ord. 983 § 2, 1990; Ord. 867 § 1, 1985.]

9.24.080 Miscellaneous provisions.
A. Additional Rules and Regulations. The chief of police may adopt rules and regulations considered necessary to ensure conformance to this chapter.

9.24.090 False alarm fee.
A. For every false alarm in excess of two within any 30-day period or in excess of eight within any 12-month period, the alarm user shall pay a false alarm fee.

B. The amount of the false alarm fee shall be established by council resolution.

9.24.100 Preventative assessment – Collection process.
A. The city may refuse to issue a business license renewal of a business from which the false alarm fee is due until the fee is paid.

B. Failure to pay the false alarm fee is a debt owed to the city. The city may bring an action for the collection of the debt.

C. The debt bears interest at the rate of nine percent a year. Interest accrues from the due date stated on the billing. [Ord. 993 § 2, 1990.]

9.25.010 Findings and purpose.
The city council finds as follows:

A. The city of Pittsburg, pursuant to the police powers delegated to it by the California Constitution, has the authority to enact laws which promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its residents.

B. The occurrence of loud or unruly gatherings, or gatherings where persons under the age of 21 are present and where alcoholic beverages are in the possession of, or are being consumed by, any person under the age of 21, is harmful to the community and the underage persons and is a public nuisance.

C. The city of Pittsburg has made numerous and substantial efforts to enforce underage drinking laws. Despite these efforts, alcohol use by youth remains a serious problem in the city, contributing significantly to the incidence of adolescent crime, addiction, truancy, driving under the influence of alcohol, and motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol and causing injury and/or death.

D. Residents have failed to prevent the occurrence of loud or unruly gatherings, including those where alcohol is served to, consumed by or possessed by underage persons, which seriously disrupt neighboring residents’ quiet enjoyment of their property.

E. Control of loud or unruly gatherings and control of gatherings where alcohol is served to a minor is necessary because such activity is determined to be a public nuisance.

F. Persons held responsible for allowing, permitting or hosting loud or unruly gatherings or gatherings where alcohol is served to persons under 21 will be more likely to properly supervise or stop such gatherings.

G. Law enforcement, fire, and other emergency response services personnel have responded, sometimes on multiple occasions, to loud or unruly gatherings or gatherings where alcohol is served to, consumed by, or in the possession of underage persons, on private property, and responses to such gatherings result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the city, which are supplemented by the general municipal taxes paid by residents and taxpayers, and such responses result in a delay of responses to regular and emergency calls to the rest of the city.

H. Problems associated with loud or unruly gatherings or gatherings where alcohol is served, consumed by, or in the possession of underage persons are difficult to prevent or deter unless the city has the legal authority to issue an administrative citation or an administrative fine.

I. The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, peace, safety and quiet enjoyment of residential property, and general welfare.

J. Section 25658 of the Business and Professions Code makes it unlawful for a person under the age of 21 years to purchase or attempt to purchase or consume alcoholic beverages and makes it unlawful for any person to sell any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21.

K. According to local, state, and federal surveys, alcohol is overwhelmingly and consistently the most widely used drug at all adolescent age levels. A child who begins alcohol use prior to age 15 is four times as likely to experience alcohol dependence than one who refrains from alcohol until age 20 or older.

L. The city council of the city of Pittsburg determines that this chapter is a reasonable and necessary means to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the youth and other residents of the city of Pittsburg. [Ord. 13-1374 § 2, 2013.]

9.98.010 Purpose and intent.
The public health, safety and welfare require the timely removal of wrecked, disabled, abandoned or certain illegally parked motor vehicles. Such vehicles create hazards, especially to traffic safety, and must be removed as quickly as possible. In order to ensure the efficient removal of impediments from the city’s roadways and to provide dependable service to the public, it is necessary to establish regulations for the operation of vehicle towing services. [Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.020 Regulation.
A. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all participating tow operators responding to requests for tow services made by the city regardless of whether the request was originated by the city or a private citizen.

B. It is unlawful for any tow service or operator to tow any vehicles subject to the provisions of this chapter unless such operator or service is either on the city’s current rotational tow list or has entered into a written agreement with the city to provide towing services. Nothing in this chapter prevents a private citizen from requesting any towing service to remove and tow away that citizen’s vehicle. [Ord. 1119 § 3, 1996; Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.030 Unlawful solicitation.
It is unlawful for any operator or his agent or employee to solicit any work which is within the scope of this chapter. An operator shall only tow vehicles when requested to do so by the city or the owner or driver of a vehicle. A violation of this section shall be cause for the operator to be immediately terminated from the rotational tow list. [Ord. 1119 § 4, 1996; Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.040 Selection and designation.
A. There shall be two rotational tow lists in the city: (1) a list for towing abandoned vehicles; and (2) a list for towing all other vehicles. The city manager or his designee shall have general supervision and control over the rotational tow lists. The city manager may, in his sole discretion, delegate all or a portion of his authority under this chapter to one or more designees, and a reference to the city manager in this chapter shall also include his designee. In lieu of a rotational list for the towing of abandoned vehicles, the city manager may enter into an agreement with a qualified tow operator to provide abandoned vehicle towing and/or storage services. Prior to entering into such agreement, the city shall solicit proposals by eligible operators, as directed by the city manager.

B. An operator may only apply for inclusion on one list. For abandoned vehicle tows, the city manager shall select qualified tow operators from applications received and place their names on the abandoned vehicle rotational tow list.

C. An operator who wishes to be included on one of the city’s rotational lists shall complete an application provided by the city. An operator is eligible to apply if he possesses a valid city business license, his towing service has its principal place of business within city limits, and he meets the requirements of this chapter. For purposes of this section, “principal place of business” shall mean that the primary business office and primary storage facility shall be located within city limits. The city manager or his designee shall make the final decision as to whether or not an operator’s principal place of business is located within city limits and such decision may not be appealed. The operator’s primary storage facility shall be the same location as the operator’s primary business office, absent prior approval from the city. The operator shall submit such additional information as the city manager may request to demonstrate the operator’s ability to comply with this chapter.

D. The city manager may, in his sole discretion, approve or deny the application if in his judgment the operator is unable to comply with the provisions of this chapter; the operator has made or caused to be made a false statement on his application; or the operator has been convicted of any crime punishable as a felony or any crime involving stolen or embezzled vehicles, stolen property, fraud, driving while intoxicated, sale or use of illegal drugs, or moral turpitude.

E. If the operator’s application is denied, the operator may appeal the denial in the manner provided in PMC 9.98.260. [Ord. 1119 § 5, 1996; Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.050 Application fee.
An operator who applies for inclusion on the rotation lists shall pay a processing fee as established by the chief of police. [Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.060 Minimum standards for equipment and drivers.
Minimum standards for equipment and drivers of tow operators who perform services under this chapter are as follows:

A. Truck Chassis. A truck chassis shall have a capacity of at least one ton and have rear dual wheels or their equivalent.

B. Company Name. A sign showing the name of the towing company or the owner or operator of the tow car and the business address and telephone number of the owner or driver shall be displayed on both doors of the tow vehicle cab. These signs shall comply with the provisions of Vehicle Code Section 27907.

C. Lights. Tow trucks must be equipped with all lights required by state law, such as headlights, taillights, red reflectors, stoplights and warning lights. Tow trucks must also be equipped with one adjustable or portable white utility light. Tow trucks may be equipped with other lights the owner or operator may desire which are not forbidden by law.

D. Winch. Each tow truck must have one power-driven winch operated from a transmission equipped with safety dogs or equivalent braking devices.

E. Additional Equipment. Trucks must be equipped with red flares, lanterns or reflectors, portable warning signs, hand tools, crowbar, rope, broom, shovel, dustpan, fire extinguisher (dry chemical type), portable red taillight and stoplight for towed vehicles, dry sand or other material for absorbing gas and oil from streets, equipment for opening locked vehicles and safety snubber chain. Each truck shall have at least one set of dollies readily available at all times.

F. Drivers. Tow truck drivers shall display reasonable competence in their work and possess a valid California driver’s license of the proper class as provided in Vehicle Code Section 12520. The chief of police may remove an operator from the rotation lists if he finds that the operator employs a driver who, within the preceding 36 months of the date of his service with the operator, has been convicted of one or more of the following crimes:

1. Auto theft, burglary, possession of stolen property, grand or petty theft;

2. A crime involving violence of the person of another;

3. A violation of the Health and Safety Code relating to narcotics or dangerous drugs;

4. A violation of Sections 4461, 4462(b), 4463, 4464, or 5017 of Division 3 of the California Vehicle Code;

5. A violation of any provision of Division 4 of the California Vehicle Code; or

6. A crime relating to illegal acquisition of a vehicle or vehicle parts or documents relating to vehicle registration or ownership.

G. Communications. An operator shall provide equipment to allow two-way radio communication capability between the operator’s dispatcher and each tow truck. [Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.070 Storage facilities.
A. Each operator of a towing service on the rotational list or under agreement with the city shall maintain a storage lot within city limits in an appropriately zoned district with adequate and secure storage space to accommodate towed vehicles. Storage lots, buildings and any fences shall be approved in writing by the city. An operator shall have access to a secured building in an approved location with the capacity to store at least 10 vehicles. Storage lots and secured building shall be designed so that stored vehicles are reasonably screened from public view.

B. The operator shall be responsible for the reasonable care, custody and control of any property contained in towed and/or stored vehicles and shall take all appropriate action to ensure that stored vehicles and their contents are safe from tampering or vandalism.

C. Notwithstanding subsection (A) of this section, abandoned vehicles may be stored outside city limits if the storage location has been approved in writing by the city. [Ord. 1119 § 6, 1996; Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.080 Rotation procedure for towing vehicles other than abandoned vehicles.
The police department shall evenly rotate its requests for towing vehicles other than abandoned vehicles between the operators on the rotational list for such vehicles.

A. When an operator is given and completes a call, that operator moves to the bottom of the list.

B. Whenever more than one tow truck is needed to respond to a call for service, a separate operator shall be called for each truck. Each operator called shall be credited with a call and moved to the bottom of the list in the order called.

C. Whenever the owner of a vehicle or the owner’s representative requests a tow operator by name, the tow operator’s position on the rotation lists shall not be changed. This practice shall also be followed if the owner or his representative requests a tow operator authorized to tow on behalf of a named insurance company.

D. If the department is unable to reach the operator in first position for a call, or if the operator accepts a call and is subsequently unable to respond as required, that operator shall be credited with a call and moved to the bottom of the list.

E. If the department in its judgment determines that the operator in first position is improperly equipped or otherwise incapable of adequately responding to a specific call, the department may pass over that operator and continue down the list until it reaches an operator it considers capable of adequately responding to the call. If no operator on the list has the necessary skills or equipment to adequately respond, the department may request service from an operator not on the list. A change from the normal rotation procedure under these circumstances does not alter any operator’s position on the list, except that the operator actually chosen shall be credited with a call and moved to the bottom of the list.

F. The department shall maintain rotation records and make them available for inspection to tow operators and the public upon request. [Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.090 Rotation procedure for towing abandoned vehicles.
With respect to the towing of abandoned vehicles, the city manager may either enter into an agreement with one tow operator on such terms and conditions as may be negotiated or create a rotational tow list and follow the rotational process described in PMC 9.98.080. If the city manager elects to have an agreement with a tow operator for removal of abandoned vehicles, the city shall undertake a solicitation for proposals as directed by the city manager prior to entering into any such agreement. [Ord. 1119 § 7, 1996; Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.100 Hours of availability and response time.
A. Each tow operator shall have at least one driver on call at all times (24 hours per day, seven days per week including Sundays and holidays) capable of responding to a police request for towing.

B. Once an operator is called by the department for service, the operator must respond to the scene within 20 minutes, unless the department has specifically requested an expedited tow, in which case the operator must respond to the scene within 10 minutes. If an operator accepts a call and subsequently cannot respond, he must notify the department of his inability to respond within five minutes of initially receiving the call. If the operator gives this required notice, he shall be moved to the bottom of the appropriate rotation list. If the operator fails to give this required notice, he shall be moved to the bottom of the rotation list and be subject to a 30-day suspension from the rotation lists by the chief of police. There is no recourse or appeal from this suspension.

C. An operator is also subject to a 30-day suspension by the chief of police without recourse if the operator accepts a call and then fails to respond within the required time. [Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.110 City vehicles.
The chief of police is authorized to enter into an agreement with any tow operator on the rotation lists to tow disabled city vehicles as needed. An operator shall not be credited with a call or moved to the bottom of a rotation list when called to tow a disabled city vehicle. [Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.120 Impounded vehicles.
The chief of police is authorized to enter into an agreement with a tow operator to tow and store vehicles which the department requires to be impounded for special investigative or evidentiary reasons. Vehicles towed under this section shall be stored in a place of maximum security. The chief shall select an operator from among those operators on the rotation lists and may in his discretion call for sealed bids and any additional information he requires. An operator selected by the chief to tow vehicles under this section shall not be credited with a call or moved to the bottom of a rotation list when called to tow a vehicle under this section. [Ord. 912 § 1, 1986.]

9.98.130 Removal of hazards.
Once an operator arrives at the location to which he has been dispatched, he shall cooperate with police officers on the scene in removing hazards and illegally parked vehicles as requested, and shall remove all other debris and perform the duties required by Vehicle Code Section 27700.

1. The application shall contain a description or a map showing the proposed residential permit parking area.

2. The application shall include a petition containing the signature, printed name, and address of residents of at least 67 percent of the dwelling units in the proposed area.

3. At the top of each page of the petition shall appear the following statement, with the proposed time restriction included:

We, the undersigned, are residents of the proposed residential permit parking area described in this application. We request that it be designated a preferential residential permit parking area and, if it is, understand that the following restrictions will be placed upon on-street parking within the area:_______________; that residents of the area and their visitors will be eligible to obtain permits exempting them from such parking restrictions; that an annual fee for residential parking permits may be charged. The fee, if any, will be determined by Council Resolution, and may be adjusted annually.

B. An area for which an application meeting the above requirements has been received shall have its eligibility for permit parking determined on the basis of the criteria listed below.

If an area is deemed eligible, a resolution establishing it as a permit parking area shall be drafted. The resolution shall specify the following:

1. The boundaries of the area;

2. The appropriate prohibition or restriction on parking for the area;

3. The period of the day and the days of the week of the parking prohibition or restriction’s application;

4. The beginning and ending dates of the 12-month period for which permits for the area shall be issued.

In addition, this chapter ensures that storeowners will take action to reduce the removal of shopping carts from a business establishment’s premises.

10.59.070 Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this chapter is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter.

10.60.010 Findings.
The city council finds that:

A. Transportation systems management (TSM) programs have the potential to reduce vehicle trips and vehicle emissions more efficiently and cost effectively than major roadway improvements;

B. For many years prior to the passage of Measure C, local jurisdictions developed and implemented a variety of TSM projects and programs, e.g., operation of transit systems, construction of bicycle facilities, land use policy coordination and related improvements;

C. The Contra Costa Transportation Authority (“the authority”) has committed both Measure C and transportation fund for clean air (TFCA) funds to four subarea programs for the implementation of Measure C and clean air plan goals;

D. In compliance with the requirements contained in the authority’s model TSM ordinance, large employers are required to develop and implement trip reduction programs at work sites; pursuant to that requirement, implementation of the model TSM ordinance was delegated to Tri-Delta Transit;

E. The countywide comprehensive transportation plan incorporates each regional committee’s action plan for routes of regional significance, which support specific TSM goals and objectives;

F. Over the past four years, the subarea TSM programs have been successful in reducing vehicle trips and emissions at the employment sites specified in the authority’s model TSM ordinance as well as in school and residential areas where programs have been implemented;

G. Since adoption of the authority’s model TSM ordinance, TSM efforts have been expanded to include aspects of the transportation systems other than employer programs, e.g., enhancement of transit and bicycle facilities, incorporation of new technologies into the system, land use policy coordination and related enhancements;

H. Cooperation and coordination with other local jurisdictions and regions in TSM will enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the TSM efforts; and

I. Adoption of this chapter is in the best interests of the public health, safety and general welfare and is in accordance with the policies, goals and objectives set forth in the authority’s model TSM ordinance. [Ord. 1139 § 2, 1997.]

10.60.020 Purpose.
This chapter is enacted by the city for the following purposes:

A. To assist staff in continuing the implementation of the model TSM ordinance and programs contained therein;

B. To promote maximum efficiency in the existing transportation system and to further the transportation goals of the Measure C growth management program, Contra Costa’s congestion management program and the Bay Area clean air plan by:

1. Promoting and encouraging the use of transit, ride sharing, bicycling, walking, flexible work hours and telecommuting as alternatives to solo driving,

2. Incorporating these goals and objectives into the land use review and planning process,

3. Developing proactive programs and/or projects either alone or in conjunction with other jurisdictions, or with local jurisdiction’s regional transportation planning committee aimed at achieving these goals,

4. Considering the incorporation of appropriate technology designed to facilitate traffic flow, provide transit and highway information, provide trip generation alternatives and related technology into the transportation system, and

5. Cooperating with other jurisdictions, the private sector, and transit operators in planning and implementing transportation programs;

C. To reflect an ongoing commitment to expand TSM efforts beyond employer-based trip reduction programs, in order to achieve traffic congestion management and air quality goals; and

D. To comply with applicable state and federal laws as well as with Measure C growth management program requirements. [Ord. 1139 § 2, 1997.]

10.60.030 Goal.
The goal of this chapter is to ensure the continuation of proactive TSM program efforts aimed at reducing vehicle trips, vehicle emission and traffic congestion in the most efficient and cost effective manner. [Ord. 1139 § 2, 1997.]

10.60.040 Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are to establish the following policies:

A. The city’s participation, in conjunction with other jurisdictions and their regional transportation planning committee, in proactive efforts to support and develop projects which will achieve the Measure C TSM/TDM goals as described in the Regional Transportation Planning Committee’s action plan; the countywide comprehensive transportation plan; the Measure C strategic plan; the congestion management plan; and/or the Bay Area clean air plan. Such participation may include, but need not be limited to:

1. Promotion and encouragement of the use of transit, ride sharing, bicycling, walking, flexible work hours, telecommuting or other alternatives to solo driving, and

2. Projects incorporating appropriate technology designed to facilitate traffic flow, provide transit and highway information and related technology;

B. To incorporate these goals into the city’s land use review and planning process. [Ord. 1139 § 2, 1997.]

D. If upon the expiration of the 30-day period the required underground facilities have not been provided, the city engineer shall proceed to do the work; provided, however, if such premises are unoccupied and no electric or communications services are being furnished thereto, the city engineer shall, in lieu of providing the required underground facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying utility service to the property. Upon completion of the work by the city engineer, he shall file a written report with the city council setting forth the fact that the required underground facilities have been provided and the cost thereof, together with a legal description of the property against which such cost is to be assessed. The council shall thereupon fix a time and place for hearing protests against the assessment of the cost of such work upon such premises, which time shall not be less than 10 days thereafter.

E. The city engineer shall, upon the time for hearing such protests having been fixed, give a notice in writing to the person in possession of such premises, and a notice in writing thereof to the owner thereof, in the manner hereinabove provided for the giving of the notice to provide the required underground facilities, of the time and place that the council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against such assessment.

[1937 Code § 385.8.]

12.36.100 Responsibility of city.

12.36.110 Extension of time.
In the event that any act required by this chapter or by a resolution adopted pursuant to PMC 12.36.030 cannot be performed within the time provided on account of shortage of materials, war, restraint by public authorities, strikes, labor disturbances, civil disobedience or any other circumstances beyond the control of the actor, then the time within which the act will be accomplished shall be extended for a period equivalent to the time of such limitation.

12.44.050    Payment by benefited property owner.

12.44.060    Implementation.

12.44.010 Purpose.
A. As a condition of approval of the grant of a land use entitlement for the development of property, a developer may be required to install public improvements that provide a benefit to the general public and to other specific properties in the vicinity of the improvements. This situation may occur when one developer elects to seek approval and begin development sooner than another. In connection with such a development, governmental entities such as the city, the redevelopment agency or others may contribute to the cost of additional or oversized improvements.

B. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a mechanism whereby a property owner who benefits by, but does not contribute to, certain public improvements will, at the time the benefited property owner develops property, reimburse the developer or government agency that has installed improvements. [Ord. 1169 § 1, 2000.]

12.44.020 Definitions.
In this chapter:

A. “Benefit district” means the geographical area which benefits by a privately or governmentally financed public improvement.

B. “Benefited property” means a property within a benefit district for which no contribution to the cost of the public improvement was made at the time of its construction. Benefited property can include property owned by a public agency.

C. “Financing party” means a property owner, developer or governmental entity that installs or pays for the installation of public improvements within or of benefit to a benefit district.

D. “Land use entitlement” may include any of the following as specified in a reimbursement agreement: a permit or approval granted by the city for the development of property, a use permit, final subdivision map (but not a tentative subdivision map unless accompanied by another entitlement described herein), a land use permit, a development agreement, a grading permit, and an architectural or design review approval. [Ord. 1169 § 1, 2000.]

12.44.030 Public improvement reimbursement agreement – Procedure.
A. General. If a property owner is required to construct public improvements as a condition of approval of a proposed development and the required public improvements have the capacity and capability of serving and are designed to serve additional properties not within the proposed development and to directly benefit other properties in the vicinity, the property owner may apply to the city for a reimbursement agreement as provided in this chapter.

B. Application. A person requesting a reimbursement agreement shall submit an application on a form provided by the city and shall provide information as required by the city engineer, including the area of the proposed benefit district. The applicant shall also submit a proposed form of agreement.

C. Governmental Contributions and Reimbursement. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if the city of Pittsburg, the redevelopment agency of the city or any other governmental agency contributes to the cost of an improvement for which a benefit district is established pursuant to this chapter, such contributing entity may also request a reimbursement agreement as a financing party.

D. Notice and Hearing. The city council shall hold a public hearing on the application. At least 10 days before the hearing the city shall notify each affected property owner in writing, advising of the hearing and providing a copy of the proposed reimbursement agreement and staff report which will be submitted to the council. In this subsection, “affected property owner” means (1) the record owner (as shown on the latest county assessor’s secured real property assessment roll) of each property within the proposed benefit district, and (2) the financing party.

1. An affected property owner may file written or oral comments or objections to the application before or at the hearing.

2. No property may be added to a benefit district unless the notice is sent to the affected property owner. Failure to receive the notice required by this section shall not invalidate the reimbursement agreement.

E. City Council Action – Findings. After the public hearing, the city council may by resolution grant, grant with modification or deny approval of a reimbursement agreement. Before granting approval, the city council shall make each of these findings:

1. The improvement for which reimbursement is sought is a public improvement which will, upon completion be accepted by the city;

2. The public improvement has the capacity and capability of serving and is designed to serve additional properties not within the proposed development due to the supplemental size, capacity, number or length of the improvement;

3. The proposed benefit district represents a geographical area of property which will benefit directly and substantially by the public improvement; and

4. The method of determining contribution and the amount of contribution is fair and reasonable to both the financing party and the benefited property owner and fairly distributes the charge among all subject parcels in proportion to the estimated benefit each will receive from the proposed improvement.

The findings of the city council shall be deemed to be legislative findings and shall be final and conclusive.

F. Timing. A financing party may not request and the city council may not approve a public improvement reimbursement agreement after the date construction begins on a public improvement. For purposes of this section, the date construction begins is the later of: (1) the first date on which physical construction of the improvement is commenced, or (2) the first date that privately owned and constructed improvements are dedicated to or acquired by the city. Design work, soil testing, environmental study or other similar activity shall not be considered construction under this section.

G. Recordation. The city shall have an approved public improvement reimbursement agreement, including a list of the benefited properties, recorded in the office of the county recorder.

H. Limitation of Actions. The validity of a benefit district, reimbursement agreement or any of the findings or actions of the city council under this chapter shall not be contested in any action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding is commenced within 30 days after the approval of the reimbursement agreement pursuant to subsection (E) of this section. Any appeal from a final judgment in such an action or proceeding shall be perfected within 30 days after the entry of judgment. [Ord. 1169 § 1, 2000.]

12.44.040 Public improvement reimbursement agreement – Contents.
A public improvement reimbursement agreement shall include, but is not limited to, the following provisions:

A. A statement of the total construction cost, the applicant’s equitable share of the cost, and the amount of the total cost eligible for reimbursement;

B. A map approved by the city engineer showing each property included within the benefit district and a list of each property by county assessor parcel number;

C. The method of spreading the eligible reimbursement cost to the charges under the agreement to properties within the benefit district and the rate of interest (not to exceed 12 percent), to be added to the initial charges during the period of the agreement; provided, however, that the total accumulated interest payable at the time of reimbursement under the reimbursement agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the initial charges;

D. A provision indicating who the financing party is for the purpose of receiving reimbursement, i.e., whether the developer or the property owner of record at the time the reimbursement is made. (This may depend upon whether the public improvement is financed by the developer or by individual property owners through an assessment district);

E. The date on which the reimbursement agreement takes effect and benefited property owners begin contributions;

F. A statement that no reimbursement charges collected by the city may be distributed to a financing party until the public improvement is completed and accepted by the city;

G. A list of the administrative costs, if any, to be charged by the city to administer the agreement. These costs may be shown as a percentage of the charges collected by the city;

H. A provision that reimbursement to the financing party shall be paid only from charges collected by the city trader the agreement from the benefited properties listed in the agreement as such properties receive a land use entitlement. Reimbursement to the financing party shall be paid only from such charges collected within 25 years from the date the agreement becomes effective, unless a different time period is approved by the city council; and

I. A provision that the city is not liable to the financing party for failure of the city to collect a reimbursement charge due from a property or because of legal inability of the city to collect the charge from a property. [Ord. 1169 § 1, 2000.]

12.44.050 Payment by benefited property owner.
A. A benefited property owner shall pay to the city the applicable contribution charge set forth in the agreement whenever that person obtains a land use entitlement. The charge is payable at the time the entitlement is granted.

B. The contribution charge applies only: (1) after the reimbursement agreement is recorded; (2) during a period a reimbursement agreement is in effect; and (3) if the city engineer determines that the land use entitlement involves the scope and type of development contemplated by the agreement. Payment of the contribution charge is not required as a condition of issuing a land use entitlement for the alteration or enlargement of an existing building or structure (or the erection of an accessory building or structure) if the work:

1. Is on the same parcel of land; and

2. Does not create an additional dwelling unit; and

3. Will not change the potential for traffic generation; and

4. In any three-year period will not exceed one-half the value of all existing improvements on that parcel of land.

C. No property may be assessed a double fee under this chapter.

D. A benefitted property owner has no obligation to pay a contribution charge if the owner does not develop the property during the effective period of the reimbursement agreement. [Ord. 1169 § 1, 2000.]

12.44.060 Implementation.
The city council may adopt rules and regulations it considers necessary to implement this chapter. [Ord. 1169 § 1, 2000.]

13.10.010 Findings and purpose.
A. The board of directors of the Contra Costa water district (the “district”) has adopted Resolution No. 93-24 which creates and imposes a new facilities reserve charge (the “raw water fee”) on wholesale municipal customers. The raw water fee applies to all new or enlarged water meters permitted by the city.

B. The city council has determined that the raw water fee owed to the district for each new or enlarged water meter shall be passed through to the water customer requesting the new or enlarged water meter. [Ord. 1066 § 1, 1993.]

13.10.020 Collection of fee.
Any applicant requesting a new or enlarged water meter shall pay a raw water fee. The raw water fee shall be in the amount established and collected by the Contra Costa water district. [Ord. 08-1301 § 1, 2008; Ord. 1066 § 1, 1993.]

13.10.030 Time of payment.
A. The raw water fee set forth in this chapter shall be paid prior to the issuance of any required building permit, or at such earlier time as established by district’s written procedures and consistent with applicable law. If a building permit is not required, the raw water fee shall be paid at the time any connection or change in meter size is made, or at such earlier time as established by the district’s written procedures and consistent with applicable law.

B. District shall submit proof that the raw water fee has been collected to the building division, in a form satisfactory to the city. Upon receipt of satisfactory proof that the raw water fee has been paid, the city may issue any required permit consistent with applicable law.

13.12.010 Billing – Frequency.
Water accounts shall be billed monthly. [Ord. 04-1220 § 2, 2004; 1937 Code § 497.1.]

13.12.020 Meter – Reading.
Under ordinary conditions meters will be read monthly or bimonthly on approximately the same day of the month and a bill issued showing the period covered by the meter readings, the amount of water used and the total charges applicable for that bill period. [Ord. 1106 § 4, 1996; 1937 Code § 497.2.]

13.12.030 Designated.
A. The monthly rates to be charged by the city for water supplied from its waterworks to consumers shall be in the amount established by city council resolution.

B. Additional administrative charges may be assessed on the water bill and be collected in the same manner as charges for water. Such charges shall be designated by city council resolution, and may include, but not be limited to, charges for returned checks, collection agency fees, charges for obstructed meters and return visits, special installations and other such charges. Administrative fees shall be established by resolution by the city council and staff and shall only be in an amount necessary to recover actual costs.

C. Any water purveyor, whether public or private (if allowed by ordinance), who provides municipal water service shall pay to the city a franchise fee in the amount of seven percent of the entity’s gross water revenues collected in the city. Such franchise fee is justified on the basis that franchise fees generally compensate the city for a water purveyor’s utilization of city rights-of-way, including the burden on the city’s infrastructure. A public water system likewise benefits from use of the public rights-of-way for the pipelines, distribution systems and other aspects of the existing infrastructure. Therefore, it is reasonable to factor the franchise payment into the cost of the water purveyor’s provision of water service. Additionally, courts have recognized that where a municipality acts in its proprietary capacity, it has the same rights and liabilities of any private person or entity. [Ord. 08-1308 § 2, 2008; Ord. 05-1243 § 5, 2005; Ord. 04-1220 § 3, 2004; Ord. 1167 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1125 § 2, 1997; Ord. 1106 § 5, 1996; Ord. 870 § 1(A), 1985; 1937 Code § 497.3.]

13.12.035 Special exemption – Qualifying senior citizens.
A. Residential water customers of the city who qualify as set forth in this section shall be eligible for reduced water rates as set forth in subsection (E) of this section. In order to be eligible for the exemption, a claimant must meet the requirements of either subsection (A)(1) or (2) as follows:

1. A claimant under this subsection must have an annual household income as set by city council resolution and be at least 62 years of age, or disabled as established by the Social Security Administration Supplemental Income Program for the aged, blind and disabled; or

2. A claimant under this subsection shall be a qualified nonprofit entity that owns and operates a shared residential facility for senior citizens. For purposes of this section, a “qualified nonprofit entity” means an organization formed for other than profit-making purposes and exempt from the payment of federal income taxes, and which meets such other requirements as determined by the finance director. For purposes of this subsection, “shared facility” means a residential facility that has common or shared kitchen, laundry and similarly related facilities available for its residents. The exemption provided under this subsection shall be applicable only to qualified nonprofit entities and shall not apply to individual water customers. The portion of the claimant’s water bill which is subject to this exemption shall be that attributable to water use by its residents who have a household income as set by city council resolution and who are at least 62 years of age, or disabled as established by the Social Security Administration Supplemental Income Program for the aged, blind and disabled;

3. In subsections (A)(1) and (2) of this section where it refers to “household income” it means the adjusted gross income (not including Social Security income) of all members of the household as shown on the completed application form. In the case of a husband and wife, it is the amount indicated in their joint return or the sum of the amounts indicated on their individual returns.

B. A claim for an exemption under this section shall be submitted on a form provided by the city and shall be filed with the finance department. All statements shall be made under oath and subject to penalty of perjury. The finance department may require such additional evidence as it deems necessary or appropriate in processing such claim.

C. Any change in the qualifying status of the claimant during the fiscal year of the exemption shall be immediately reported to the finance director for review.

D. An exemption approved under subsection (A)(1) of this section shall be limited to water service charges paid for the residential dwelling occupied by the claimant and shall apply only when the claimant contributes no less than 50 percent to the financial support of the household. As to an exemption approved under subsection (A)(2) of this section, the finance director is authorized to adjust water charges in a proportionate manner based upon the number of residents at the nonprofit shared facility who meet the relevant qualifying income and other criteria contained in this section.

E. Effective June 2, 2004, the monthly rates for water delivered by the city to residents who qualify, as set forth in this section, shall be in the amount established by city council resolution. [Ord. 08-1308 § 2, 2008; Ord. 05-1243 § 6, 2005; Ord. 04-1220 § 4, 2004; Ord. 1167 § 3, 2000; Ord. 1142 § 1, 1998; Ord. 1125 § 3, 1997; Ord. 1106 § 6, 1966.]

13.12.040 Meter – Monthly charges.
There shall be a minimum monthly charge on each meter which shall include the water purchased on the rates designated by PMC 13.12.030. The minimum monthly charge shall be as established by city council resolution. [Ord. 10-1324 § 2, 2010; Ord. 05-1243 § 7, 2005; Ord. 1167 § 4, 2000; Ord. 1125 § 4, 1997; Ord. 870 § 1(B), 1985; 1937 Code § 497.4.]

13.12.050 Meter – Additional service charge.
In addition to the minimum charges set forth in PMC 13.12.040 and in addition to the rates for water supplied as set forth in PMC 13.12.030, there shall be a monthly service charge on each water meter as established by city council resolution. [Ord. 05-1243 § 8, 2005; Ord. 1167 § 5, 2000; Ord. 1125 § 5, 1997; Ord. 870 § 1(C), 1985; 1937 Code § 497.5.]

13.12.060 Payment – Delinquencies – Shutoffs.
A. Payment Delinquencies. A water bill shall be due and payable within 25 days after the city mails the bill to the property owner. In any case, for any bill that is not paid within 30 days after the city mails the bill to the property owner, the unpaid balance is subject to a 10 percent penalty.

If thereafter the bill is not paid by the forty-fifth day from the billing date, the finance director or designated representative may cause the water to be shut off at the meter pursuant to the procedure set forth in subsection (B) of this section. The water shall not thereafter be turned on except upon the payment of the delinquent bill in full and a reconnection fee as established by city council resolution.

If turn on is required any time after 3:00 p.m., an additional charge as established by city council resolution shall be made to cover the additional costs. In case the water is turned on at the premises of the property owner after it has been turned off by the finance director or designated representative and before the delinquent bill has been paid, the finance director or designated representative shall cause the water meter at such consumer’s premises to be removed without advance notice. Provisions under PMC 13.12.105 (Unauthorized use of water – Tampering – Illegal water access) shall apply.

The meter shall not be reinstalled except upon the payment of the delinquent bill and additional reinstallation charges for a pulled meter as established by city council resolution for removal and replacement of the meter.

B. Shutoffs. The finance director or designated representative is authorized to cause the shutoff of water to the premises, providing the following procedure is followed:

The director of finance or designated representative shall mail in the United States mail service a letter giving the consumer five days from the date of receipt of the letter to show cause why the water should not be turned off. The finance director or designated representative shall afford the consumer an opportunity to be heard, either in writing or orally, as to why the water should not be turned off. In the event that the consumer does not respond, or that the finance director or designated representative finds that the money is due and owing from the consumer, the water may be shut off after so finding.

C. Nothing in this section shall affect the city’s authority and ability to shut off the water at any time for purposes of making repairs, tests or extensions to the system, or for any other purpose as provided in PMC 13.04.050. [Ord. 11-1354 § 1, 2011; Ord. 10-1324 § 2, 2010; Ord. 08-1308 § 2, 2008; Ord. 1106 § 7, 1996; Ord. 738 § 1, 1978; Ord. 734 § 1, 1978; 1937 Code § 497.6.]

13.12.070 Payment – Under protest.
A. When a consumer complains that the amount of water consumed in any one billing period was less than the amount billed, then the bill may be paid under protest. After payment of the bill under protest and the filing by the consumer of a written complaint that the meter at their premises is out of order, which complaint must be accompanied by a deposit the amount of which is so designated by city council resolution, the city shall within 48 hours thereafter test the meter and then record the amount of error found, if any. If the meter is found to register less than two percent fast, the deposit shall be forfeited to the city. If the meter is found to register two percent fast or faster, the deposit shall be refunded to the customer, together with the amount overcharged on the protested bill, plus the estimated overcharge on two previous bills for the premises.

B. A dispute regarding a bill shall not justify nonpayment, underpayment or delay in payment. Disputed bills shall be paid when due. [Ord. 1106 § 8, 1996; 1937 Code § 497.7.]

13.12.080 Previous bill – Dispute procedure.
In case of dispute as to payment of a bill previously rendered, the consumer must present the receipted bill, canceled check or other evidence of payment before adjustment can be made. [1937 Code § 497.8.]

13.12.090 Consumer responsibilities.
The consumer has sole control of the amount of water drawn through the water meter and is responsible for maintenance and repairs of the pipes and fixtures beyond the water meter. The city, in order to encourage prompt repairs of leaking pipes and fixtures, will make allowances for excessive bills resulting from leakage beyond the water meter when, in its judgment, conditions warrant. In making allowances, the city will in general be governed by the following:

A. Adjustment will be allowed when claim has been made and evidence clearly shows that the excessive charge is due to leaking pipes or fixtures and not wasteful use, and then only when repairs have been promptly made and consumer has provided proof of repair to the city. No allowance will be made covering more than two consecutive billing periods, including the billing period in which the leak is discovered. Adjustments will be credited to water account.

B. At staff’s discretion, adjustment may be allowed, without showing evidence of repairs, but not more than once in any 24-month period to the same customer for the same premises. No allowance will be made covering more than two consecutive billing periods, including the billing period in which the leak is discovered.

C. Adjustments ordinarily will be made on the basis of one-half of the excess delivery due to leakage during two consecutive billing periods, but in the case of concealed leaks in underground or unexposed pipes, full excess may be allowed for such two billing periods.

D. Not more than one allowance shall be made to the same consumer for the same premises in any 12-month period when claim has been made and evidence clearly shows that the excessive charge is due to leaking pipes or fixtures and not wasteful use. The city shall be the sole judge in determining the excess delivery due to leakage.

E. For purposes of receiving an adjustment under this section, a repair is promptly made when completed within 15 days of knowledge of the leak. A repair is also promptly made if completed within 30 days of knowledge of the leak if the leaking piping/equipment is turned off within two days of knowledge of the leak. An adjustment will not be made until repairs are completed and proof of repair has been submitted to the city.

F. Upon approval, a credit adjustment shall be posted to the customer’s water account. A request for an adjustment shall not justify nonpayment, underpayment or delay in payment on account. [Ord. 15-1392 § 2, 2015; Ord. 08-1308 § 2, 2008; 1937 Code § 497.9.]

13.12.100 Bills – Owner and tenant responsibilities.
A. In residential uses, where a tenant establishes his or her own account for water service, the city shall not seek to recover any charges or penalties for nonpayment of charges from a subsequent tenant or the property owner as a result of a previous tenant’s nonpayment of water charges. For purposes of this section, the term “subsequent tenant” shall not include any adult person who lived at the residence during the period that the charges or penalties accrued. The city shall not require that water service to a subsequent tenant be furnished on the landlord’s or property owner’s water service account unless the property owner consents in writing to such requirement.

B. The city shall provide a property owner that establishes a water service billing account under their name with the option to have the bill directed to a third party. If the property owner elects to direct the bill to a third party, the property owner shall remain liable for all fees and charges to the water service account. The city shall accept payments for services provided on the water service billing account from third parties.

C. The city shall require proof of legal property ownership or tenancy along with a valid identification to establish a water service billing account. The finance director shall determine documentation required to establish proof of legal property ownership or tenancy.

D. The city may collect a security deposit in an amount not to exceed three times the estimated monthly bill prior to establishing a new residential water service account. The decision whether to require a deposit shall be based solely upon the creditworthiness of the applicant. In the event of nonpayment of all or a portion of the bill, the city shall apply the deposit to the final bill issued when service is terminated.

E. A residential tenant who applies to establish his or her own account for water service shall be deemed creditworthy, within the meaning of subsection (D) of this section, if the tenant:

1. Makes a deposit; or

2. If the applicant has a previous credit history with the city, and can demonstrate that that applicant has paid all utility bills to the city promptly during the 12 months prior to the date of the application.

F. Regardless of the provisions of subsection (E)(2) of this section, the city may always require a cash deposit if deemed appropriate.

G. Attachment of liens on property for which charges remain unpaid.

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 54354 of the Government Code of the state of California:

1. For water service accounts established by property owners, delinquent water charges of 90 days or more past due and all penalties thereon shall constitute a lien upon the real property served; provided, that the director of finance or designee records a list of delinquent unpaid charges and penalties thereon with the county recorder, stating the amount of each charge and the penalty thereon, a description of the real property upon which the charges and penalties are a lien, and the name of the city to which the delinquent charges and penalties are payable.

2. The lien shall continue in full force and effect until all of the charges and penalties are fully paid or the property sold.

3. The city shall endeavor to record a list of all such delinquent charges at least every six months, but no delay or informality in recording the same shall invalidate the lien or any unpaid water or sewer charge or any subsequent act or proceeding.

4. If through error or otherwise the amount of unpaid charges plus penalties thereon as stated in said list shall be incorrect, said error shall be disregarded and shall not affect or invalidate the filing if said error is $1.00 or less.

5. The lien will have the same force, effect, priority and duration as a judgment lien.

6. As a remedy for the collection of said charges and penalties, an action may be brought in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction, and reasonable attorney’s fees shall be awarded to the city as plaintiff. [Ord. 15-1392 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-1354 § 2, 2011; Ord. 08-1308 § 2, 2008; Ord. 1112 § 1, 1996; Ord. 1106 § 9, 1996.]

13.12.105 Unauthorized use of water – Tampering – Illegal water access.
A. Anyone using water without having made application to the city for water service shall be held liable for the service from the date of any previous meter reading that most nearly coincides with the actual date the service was first authorized for use by the customer.

B. Meter tampering is not allowed. The city reserves the right to discontinue service without notice upon the occurrence and discovery of any tampering, alteration, modification or interference with any city water meter, register, measuring device or any component of the meter with or without the knowledge of the customer.

C. Unlawful taking of water by bypassing meters, installing a jumper or any other means of reconnecting to the water system and taking water without payment is prohibited. The person will be responsible for paying for all costs, penalties and all associated damage assessments including possible criminal charges.

D. Any person violating these provisions may be found guilty of a misdemeanor. [Ord. 10-1324 § 2, 2010.]

13.12.110 Vacation of premises – Billing.
The property owner is responsible for notifying the city for discontinuance of service. The full applicable water rates shall be charged in every instance for vacated premises until the city has been notified in writing and upon proof of identification by the property owner of the discontinuance of the use of the water and instructed by the owner to turn the water off and render a final bill. [Ord. 11-1354 § 3, 2011; Ord. 10-1324 § 2, 2010; Ord. 1106 § 10, 1996; 1937 Code § 495.3.]

13.12.120 Installment purchase agreements and rate covenants.
A. The city may, from time to time, enter into one or more installment purchase agreements with the city of Pittsburg public financing authority for the purpose of financing, acquiring and/or constructing any additions, betterments, extensions or improvements to the water system designated by the city council of the city as a designated water project, the design, acquisition or construction of which (together with the incidental costs and expenses related thereto) is to be financed by the proceeds of bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness issued by the city of Pittsburg public finance authority. All payments under any such installment purchase agreement shall be payable solely from the net revenues of the water system and shall not constitute an obligation of the city’s general fund.

B. Any installment purchase agreement entered into in accordance with subsection (A) of this section may contain a covenant on the part of the city to establish, fix and collect rates, fees and charges for the water service which are reasonably fair and nondiscriminatory at such minimum levels as provided in the covenant in order to provide a secure source of payment of amounts payable under the installment purchase agreement and in order to provide adequate security for such bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, as deemed necessary by the city in connection with any such financing. Any such covenant entered into as provided in this subsection shall be deemed an obligation imposed by law, enforceable in mandamus pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085.

Under the terms of the city’s water supply permit issued by the California Department of Public Health, the city is required to comply with Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations (“CCR Title 17”) and California Health and Safety Code Section 4017 regarding cross-connection control. The state regulations imposed by the Department of Public Health are necessary to ensure that the city’s water supply is protected from harmful contaminants and pollutants resulting from backflow. [Ord. 11-1354 § 5, 2011; Ord. 08-1308 § 3, 2008; Ord. 1094 § 1, 1995.]

13.14.020 Findings and purpose.
The purposes of this chapter are:

A. To protect the city’s municipal water system from contaminants or pollutants by isolating sources of contaminants or pollutants within a customer’s internal water distribution system which could backflow or back-siphon into the city’s water system;

B. To eliminate and control cross-connections that exist between a customer’s potable water system and nonpotable water systems; and

C. To evaluate and reduce the following potential hazards to the city’s potable water supply:

1. Health hazard: any actual or potential threat of contamination of a physical or toxic nature to the city’s water system or the consumer’s potable water system that would create or, in the judgement of the director, may create a danger to health;

2. Plumbing hazard: any internal or plumbing type of cross-connection in a customer’s potable water system that may be either a pollutant or contamination-type hazard. The term “plumbing hazard” includes, but is not limited to, cross-connections to toilets, sinks, lavatories, wash trays, washing machines or lawn sprinkling systems. Plumbing-type cross-connections may be located in many types of structures, including homes, apartment houses, hotels and commercial and industrial establishments. An appropriate type of cross-connection control assembly, if permitted, must properly protect such a connection;

3. Pollution hazard: any actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or to the potability of the city’s or the consumer’s potable water system, but which would not constitute a health or system hazard, as defined;

4. System hazard: any actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the city’s water system or the consumer’s potable water system or of a pollutant or contaminant that may have a protractive effect on the quality of the potable water in the system;

5. Industrial fluids system hazard: any fluid or solution that may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as to constitute a health, water system, pollution or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This type of contamination includes but is not limited to polluted waters; all types of process waters and used waters; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies; circulated cooling tower waters (open or closed) that may be chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters, such as from wells, springs, streams, rivers, harbors or irrigation canals; oils; gases; glycerine; caustic and acidic solutions; and all other solutions which may be used for industrial or fire-fighting purposes;

D. The city council finds that adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter is necessary to ensure renewal of the city’s water supply permit and to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. [Ord. 08-1308 § 3, 2008; Ord. 1094 § 1, 1995.]

13.14.090 Backflow prevention assemblies required for fire protection systems.
The following subsections describe six classes of fire protection systems and specify the minimal backflow prevention assembly required for connection of the fire protection systems to the city’s water system. The director may require an additional backflow prevention assembly to prevent contamination of the city’s water system.

A. A Class I system is directly connected only to the city’s public water mains. All sprinkler drains discharge to the atmosphere, dry wells or other safe outlets. A Class I system has no physical connection to other water supplies and contains no antifreeze or other additives. No backflow prevention assembly shall be required for connection of a Class I system to the city’s water system unless special conditions exist as determined by the director and the fire marshal.

B. A Class II system is the same as a Class I system, except that a booster pump may be installed in the service line from the street main. No backflow prevention assembly shall be required for connection of a Class II system to the city’s water system unless special conditions exist as determined by the director and the fire marshal.

C. A Class III system is directly connected to the city’s main water supply and includes one or more of the following features: (1) an elevated storage tank; (2) a fire pump taking suction from an aboveground reservoir or tank; and (3) a pressure tank. All storage facilities may only be filled by or connected to the city’s water supply and water in the facilities must be maintained in a potable condition.

An approved DCDC backflow prevention assembly shall be required for connection of a Class III system to the city’s water system between the post-indicator valve and the on-site fire system. The DCDC shall be installed aboveground to allow a minimum of 18 inches of clearance around the valve.

D. A Class IV system is directly supplied from the city’s main water supply in the same manner as a Class I or Class II system. In addition, a Class IV system includes an unapproved auxiliary water supply on or available to the premises, or an auxiliary supply located within 1,500 feet of a pumper connection. An RPP backflow prevention assembly shall be installed for connection of a Class IV system to the city’s water system. The RPP shall be installed aboveground as closely as possible to the city’s water system.

E. A Class V system is directly supplied from the city’s main water system and is interconnected with an unapproved auxiliary water supply from a harbor, river, pond, well or other water supply where industrial fluids, additives, antifreeze and other contaminants or pollutants may be used. An RPP backflow prevention assembly shall be required for connection of a Class V system to the city’s water system. The RPP shall be installed aboveground as closely as possible to the city’s water system.

SEWER MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR
Sections:

13.26.010    Definitions.

13.26.020    Responsibility for sewer lateral and main.

13.26.030    Maintenance of sewer lateral.

13.26.040    Dispute over location of sewer malfunction – Reimbursement to city.

13.26.010 Definitions.
In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:

A. “Sewer lateral” is the pipe or conduit that discharges wastewater from an individual building into a sewer main. The lateral includes sewer piping extending both within private property and within a public street or public easement. The lateral does not include the “y” or “t” connection to the sewer main.

B. “Sewer main” is the pipe or conduit located wholly within the public street or public right-of-way which attaches to and collects wastewater being discharged from one or more sewer laterals. The sewer main includes the “y” or “t” connection attaching the sewer main line to the individual sewer lateral lines. [Ord. 1011 § 1, 1991.]

13.26.020 Responsibility for sewer lateral and main.
A. Each property owner is responsible for the installation, repair and maintenance of the sewer lateral within the owner’s private property (upper lateral).

B. The city is responsible for the repair and maintenance of the sewer lateral within the public street or public easement (lower lateral) and the sewer main. [Ord. 08-1308 § 6, 2008; Ord. 01-1188 § 2, 2001; Ord. 1011 § 1, 1991.]

13.26.030 Maintenance of sewer lateral.
Each owner shall keep his/her sewer lateral in good order at his/her own expense and is responsible for damage to any of the city’s property comprising any part of the sewer system which results from the owner’s use, repair or maintenance of the sewer lateral within the control and responsibility of the property owner. If repair or maintenance of the sewer lateral is confined to the area between the private structure and the street right-of-way or utility easement (upper sewer lateral), then this is the responsibility of the property owner. If the required sewer lateral repair extends into the sewer lateral between the street right-of-way or utility easement and the city sewer main (lower lateral), then it becomes the responsibility of the city.

The city shall have the right to enter onto private property for the purpose of inspection, maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of the portion of the lateral sewer that may be maintained by the city. [Ord. 10-1324 § 5, 2010; Ord. 08-1308 § 6, 2008; Ord. 01-1188 § 2, 2001; Ord. 1011 § 1, 1991.]

13.26.040 Dispute over location of sewer malfunction – Reimbursement to city.
A. If the location of a sewer malfunction and the responsibility for its repair is disputed or cannot be determined from surface observation, the director of public services may expose parts of the sewer line within the public street, public right-of-way, or sewer main as necessary to determine the cause of the malfunction and whether it originates within either the sewer lateral within the owner’s private property or within the sewer main or public street or public easement.

B. If the malfunction is determined to be within the lateral for which the city is responsible under the provisions of this section including the sewer main as defined in this section, the city shall conduct the repair at no charge to the property owner.

C. If the malfunction is determined to be within the sewer lateral for which the property owner is responsible, the city may proceed with the repairs to such lateral upon notice to the property owner. The city may require a written reimbursement agreement executed by the property owner before beginning repair. A malfunctioning sewer lateral located within the owner’s private property is declared to be a public nuisance. If the owner refuses to execute a reimbursement agreement, the city may abate the nuisance pursuant to Chapter 1.20 PMC and may cause the cost of abatement to be a lien against the property in the manner described in Chapter 1.20 PMC. The property owner shall reimburse the city for all costs necessarily incurred by the city in performing the repair work to the sewer lateral. [Ord. 01-1188 § 2, 2001; Ord. 1011 § 1, 1991.]

15.09.020 Post disaster demolition.
A. Intent. This chapter establishes demolition criteria for all buildings and structures damaged as a result of a disaster for which a local emergency has been declared by the city council, state, or federal government to the degree where demolition is a viable alternative to repair.

B. Application of Provisions. The provisions of this chapter are applicable following each disaster for which a local emergency has been declared by the city council, state or federal government to all buildings and structures of all occupancies regulated by the city. [Ord. 18-1458 § 2, 2018.]

15.09.021 Definitions.
The following words and phrases as used in this chapter are defined as follows:

“Condemn and condemned” shall mean no person shall enter the building or structure for any reason without the express written permission of the building official or his or her designee.

“Event” is any occurrence which results in the declaration of an emergency, and shall include, but not be limited to, fires, wind storms, earthquakes and floods. [Ord. 18-1458 § 2, 2018.]

15.09.022 Demolition criteria.
A. If after the event, and during any state of emergency, the building official determines that any building or structure poses an imminent threat to public health and safety and that protection of the public health and safety requires immediate demolition of the building or structure, or a portion of a building or structure, the official or his designee shall, without contacting the owner or providing a hearing to the property owner, order that said building or structure be demolished immediately. Upon the order of the building official or designee, the city shall immediately demolish said building or structure. Such demolition shall be performed in the interest of public health and safety without condemnation hearings otherwise required by the Pittsburg Municipal Code.

B. If, after the event, the building official determines that any building or structure poses a hazard, but not an imminent threat to the public health and safety, the official or his designee shall notify the building owner of such determination and the reasons thereof by certified mail return receipt deposited in the United States mail no later than five days after the determination is made. The notice shall set forth the date, time and place of a hearing which the building official or his designee shall conduct, and also state that during the hearing the building owner may present any evidence to explain why the building or structure should not be condemned. The decision of the building official or his designee to condemn the building or structure unless all required repairs are made shall be final. In making the final decision, the building official or his or her designee shall consider: (1) all evidence presented at the hearing by the owner or his or her representative; (2) the nature of the hazard presented by the building or structure; and (3) the likelihood of personal injury or death occurring if the building or structure is not condemned.

(See Government Code Sections 8875 through 8875.5.] Primary emphasis is placed on certain buildings of unreinforced masonry wall construction, because those buildings are particularly susceptible to serious damage accompanied by loss of life during earthquakes.

This chapter identifies potentially hazardous buildings within the city and establishes a program to mitigate hazards. [Ord. 992 § 1, 1990.]

15.14.010 Purpose.
Vacant buildings are a major cause and source of blight in both residential and nonresidential neighborhoods, especially when the owner of the building fails to actively maintain and manage the building to ensure that it does not become a liability to the neighborhood. Vacant buildings attract vagrants and transients and invite criminal activity. Use of vacant buildings by transients who may employ primitive cooking or heating methods creates a risk of fire for vacant buildings and adjacent properties. Vacant buildings (whether or not those buildings are boarded) discourage economic development and retard appreciation of property values. It is the responsibility of the owner to prevent owned property from becoming a burden to the neighborhood and community and a threat to the public health, safety and welfare.

Because of the potential economic and public health, welfare and safety problems caused by vacant buildings, the city needs to monitor vacant buildings, so that they do not become attractive nuisances, are not used by vagrants or trespassers, are properly secured and maintained, and do not become a blighting influence in the neighborhood. City departments involved in such monitoring include the police department, code enforcement, planning department and engineering department. There is a substantial cost to the city for monitoring vacant buildings which should be paid by the owners of the vacant buildings. The city has established the vacant building monitoring program to accomplish this purpose. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.020 Definitions.
A. “Building” means any structure, including, but not limited to, any residential, commercial, industrial, or assembly structure, approved for occupancy.

B. “Vacant building” means any structure or building or portion thereof that (1) is unoccupied or occupied by unauthorized persons, and (2) is unsecured or boarded.

C. “Owner” for the purpose of this chapter means a person listed on the last equalized tax roll, as maintained by the county and/or person designated by the owner who is in charge or control of the vacant building. [Ord. 07-1288 § 2, 2007; Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.030 Enforcement and remedies for violation.
A building that is boarded or vacant in violation of this chapter is a public nuisance. In addition to the provisions in this chapter, the city is authorized to use the remedies set forth in state law, the California Building Code, the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings, and the Pittsburg Municipal Code.

The remedies, procedures and penalties provided by this chapter are cumulative to each other and to any others available under state law or other city ordinances. The imposition of a vacant building monitoring fee shall not preclude the building official from seeking an administrative penalty pursuant to PMC 15.14.130.

The city’s failure to provide notices within the time specified does not constitute waiver by the city of the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.040 Owner responsibilities.
A. No person shall allow a building designed for human use or occupancy to stand vacant for more than 30 days, unless the owner establishes by substantial evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the city manager or his/her designee one of the following applies:

1. The building is the subject of an active building permit for repair or rehabilitation and the owner is progressing diligently to complete the repair or rehabilitation.

2. The building meets all applicable codes, does not contribute to blight, is ready for occupancy, and is actively being offered for sale, lease or rent.

3. The building does not contribute to and is not likely to contribute to blight because the owner is actively maintaining and monitoring the building so that it does not contribute to blight. Active maintenance and monitoring shall include:

a. Maintenance of landscaping and plant material in good condition.

b. Maintenance of the exterior of the building, including but not limited to paint and finishes, in good condition.

c. Prompt and regular removal of all exterior trash, debris and graffiti.

d. Maintenance of the building in continuing compliance with all applicable codes and regulations.

e. Prevention of criminal activity on the premises, including but not limited to use and sale of controlled substances, prostitution, criminal street gang activity, loitering or trespassing.

4. The building is vacant due to fire, flood, earthquake, landslide, mudslide, or other form of natural disaster and the owner is actively pursuing assistance for demolition, rehabilitation or restoration of the building and/or premises from local, state or federal assistance programs or from insurance agencies.

B. The owner of any boarded building, whether boarded by voluntary action of the owner or as a result of enforcement activity by the city, shall cause the boarded building to be rehabilitated for occupancy within 90 days after the building is boarded and shall comply with subsection (A) of this section.

C. The owner of any boarded building, whether boarded by voluntary action of the owner or as a result of enforcement activity by the city, shall ensure that the building is boarded to board-up standards provided in PMC 15.14.060. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.050 Quarterly monitoring fee.
A. Purpose. The quarterly monitoring and inspection fee will be used to finance the cost of inspection and enforcement related to this chapter. The revolving fund for board-up of buildings and property maintenance shall be used to secure buildings and abate conditions on the property.

B. Fee Imposed. There is imposed upon every owner of a vacant building a quarterly monitoring fee in an amount to be set by city council resolution; provided, that the fee shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of monitoring vacant buildings in the city. The city council may adjust the fee by resolution as necessary. The quarterly monitoring fee is due within 30 days of notice that the building is vacant in violation of this chapter. The fee is due for every quarter upon which the building is vacant, even if the building is only vacant part of the quarter. The owner will be billed at the beginning of each quarter while the building is in violation of this chapter. The fee shall be payable as to any building, residential or nonresidential, which:

1. Is boarded up by voluntary action of the owner or as the result of enforcement activities by the city; or

2. Is vacant for more than 30 days for any reason.

C. Fee Waiver. The vacant building monitoring fee may be waived by the city manager or his/her designee upon a showing by the owner that:

1. The owner has a building permit and is progressing diligently to repair the premises for occupancy or has an application pending for a building permit or other entitlement; or

2. The building meets all applicable codes and is actively being offered for sale, lease, or rent; or

3. The building does not contribute to and is not likely to contribute to blight because the owner is actively maintaining and monitoring the building so that it does not contribute to blight; or

4. The building is vacant due to fire, flood, earthquake, landslide, mudslide, or other form of natural disaster and the owner is actively pursuing assistance for demolition, rehabilitation or restoration of the building and/or premises from local, state or federal assistance programs or from insurance agencies; or

5. Imposition of the fee would impose a substantial economic hardship on the owner and would hinder the rehabilitation of the building.

D. Notice and Procedures. The vacant building monitoring fee shall be billed to the owner of the property. Notice shall be served either personally or by first class mail, addressed to the owner as the address appears on the last equalized assessment roll or as known to the enforcement officer. An owner is sent a bill with the notice stating a violation of this chapter exists, and that notice shall constitute enrollment in the vacant building monitoring program. Any owner may apply for a waiver on the grounds set forth in subsection (C) of this section by submitting a written statement setting forth the grounds for the waiver, and the owner’s daytime telephone number, to the city manager or his/her designee within 10 days after the billing is mailed to the owner. The owner shall provide substantial evidence in support of the owner’s statement on the grounds for the waiver. The city manager or his/her designee shall review the written statement and all related evidence and may contact the owner to discuss the application for waiver. The city manager or his/her designee shall prepare a written decision which shall be mailed to the owner and shall set forth the reasons for the decision.

E. The owner of a vacant building shall not allow or cause any use of the property or any buildings thereon unless the property owner has first corrected the violations which caused placement into the program and has paid the required quarterly monitoring fee, as well as any other penalties or fines owed to the city.

F. Upon transfer or sale of a vacant building, the seller shall provide written notification to the city manager or his/her designee that the property has been transferred or sold.

G. Within 15 days of the bill for the vacant building monitoring fee, or within 15 days after the decision of the city manager or his/her designee, the city manager or his/her designee shall file in the office of the county recorder a notice that the building is subject to the vacant building monitoring fee.

H. Any fees established pursuant to this chapter which are more than 30 days delinquent, or not paid within 30 days after the decision of the city manager or his/her designee has been mailed to the owner, shall constitute an assessment against the property. The city may use all procedures available to it to collect any unpaid fee including, but not limited to, collecting the unpaid fee on the tax roll or recording a lien on the property, consistent with applicable law. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.060 Standards for boarding a vacant building.
A. Except as provided in subsection (B) of this section, the owner shall board a vacant building according to the specifications adopted by the city and available at City Hall.

B. Buildings Abated by City. If the city manager or his/her designee boards the vacant building, the building may be boarded in a manner which is determined to adequately prevent unauthorized entry or vandalism. All costs of boarding will be recovered pursuant to the procedures in PMC 15.14.100. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.070 Abatement procedures for vacant and unsecured buildings.
A. Notice of Violation. Whenever the city manager or his/her designee determines that a vacant and unsecured building exists, an abatement notice and order may be sent to the owner directing abatement by boarding and compliance with the board-up standards, within a reasonable time of the notice.

B. Time for Correction. The notice shall provide a reasonable time for correction depending on the severity of the violation. The owner may request an extension of time, which may be granted if the city manager or his/her designee determines an extension is warranted. However, the building shall not be removed from the program and the quarterly monitoring fees shall be charged until all violations of this chapter have been corrected. It is the responsibility of the owner to alert the city of compliance and have the building removed from the program. Boarding shall be done pursuant to the standards established in PMC 15.14.060.

C. Service of Notice. Notice shall be served personally to the owner, or notice shall be posted on the premises and mailed to the owner’s address set forth on the last equalized assessment roll or as known to the enforcement officer. Such notice shall be effective upon mailing or personal service. In addition to the mailed notice, the city shall post conspicuously at least one copy of the notice upon the real property where the vacant building exists. The enforcement officer shall retain in the file a declaration of the person effecting service, declaring the date, time and manner that service was made and the date of posting.

D. The city manager or his/her designee may also require, as part of the abatement notice and order, that the owner erect fences, barriers or other suitable means to discourage access to the vacant building and to discourage illegal dumping or littering on the yards surrounding the vacant building. The city manager or his/her designee may also require the owner to post signs visible to public view that prohibit trespassing, littering or illegal dumping. The city manager or his/her designee may also require that the owner remove any litter, waste, rubbish, debris or excessive vegetation from the yard surrounding the vacant building.

E. The city manager or his/her designee may also require the owner of the property to complete and sign a letter with the Pittsburg police department authorizing the department to enforce no trespassing on the premises.

F. If the owner does not comply with the abatement notice and order within the specified time, and no appeal is filed, the city manager or his/her designee may (1) board the unsecured vacant building; (2) remove all litter, waste, rubbish, debris or excessive vegetation from the yards surrounding the vacant building; and (3) recover all costs pursuant to the procedures in PMC 15.14.100.

G. If the city manager or his/her designee boards the building, all barricade materials supplied by the city shall become the property of the owner upon payment of all costs to the city. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.080 Emergency hazard abatement.
When any open building or structure constitutes such an imminent threat to life, limb or property such that it must be secured, closed or barricaded and compliance with other provisions of this code becomes infeasible, as determined by the city manager or his/her designee, the city manager or his/her designee may summarily secure, close, and barricade the building without prior notice to the property owner. All costs incurred by the city in abating the hazard shall be borne by the property owner and failure to receive prior notice shall not affect or relieve the property owner’s obligation for payment of such costs. The city may proceed to collect the costs in the same manner as collection of unpaid vacant building monitoring fees. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.090 Additional abatement.
If a vacant building previously abated by the owner or the city manager or his/her designee pursuant to an abatement notice and order again becomes unsecured and open to unauthorized entry, the city manager or his/her designee will provide written notice to the owner to secure the building within 10 calendar days. If the yard surrounding a vacant building again contains debris, rubbish, waste or excessive vegetation, the city manager or his/her designee will provide notice to the owner to clean the property surrounding the building within 10 calendar days. If the owner fails to fix the condition within 10 calendar days of the notice, or if the owner fails to provide written notice to the city manager or his/her designee as to why the city should not abate the condition 10 days from the notice, the city manager or his/her designee may abate the nuisance and recover costs as provided for in this chapter. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.100 Abatement cost.
A. Abatement costs shall include the cost to perform the actual work, the city’s cost to administer any abatement and all other expenses incurred.

B. Once the abatement is complete, the city manager or his/her designee shall recover all abatement costs pursuant to the procedures found in PMC 1.24.070 through 1.24.150. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.110 Continuous public nuisance.
Any vacant building that was originally secured by the owner or pursuant to the administrative order may be declared a continuing public nuisance by the city manager or his/her designee if the building continues to remain open and unsecured on a periodic basis, thereby requiring additional monitoring and resecuring of the building. The city manager or his/her designee may seek demolition of this continuous public nuisance by seeking a court order or following any of the administrative abatement procedures found in this code. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.120 Appeals regarding placement into program.
A. The city hearing officer or the appropriate appeals hearing board shall have the jurisdiction to hear appeals of the following:

1. The placement of the building or property into the vacant building monitoring program; or

2. The requirement to pay fees under this chapter.

B. A determination which is appealable under this section may be appealed by the owner of the property to the city hearing officer or the appropriate appeals hearing board by filing written notice of appeal to the city manager or his/her designee within 10 days of the action for which the appeal is taken. When a notice of an appeal has been received by the city manager or his/her designee for filing:

1. The city manager or his/her designee shall, within 10 days after receipt of the notice of appeal, file it with the city hearing officer or the appropriate appeals hearing board.

2. The hearing officer or appropriate appeals hearing board staff shall set the date for the hearing and determination by the board. The hearing dates shall not be less than 10 days nor more than 60 days after the date on which the copy of the notice of appeal was filed. The decision of the hearing officer or board shall be final. [Ord. 06-1272 § 2, 2006.]

15.14.130 Boarded and vacant building penalty.
A. Penalty. Any owner of a boarded building that remains boarded in violation of PMC 15.14.040(B) or any owner of a building that remains vacant in violation of PMC 15.14.040(A) shall be liable for an administrative penalty in an amount of $500.00 per building.

1. If the building continues to meet the definition of vacant building as provided in this chapter beyond the initial 30 calendar days, and if the owner does not meet any of the exceptions set forth in this section, the city manager or his/her designee may continue to assess penalties in the following amounts: $1,000 for the next 90-calendar-day period each building continues to constitute a vacant building; $1,500 for the next 90-calendar-day period for each building that continues to constitute a vacant building; $2,000 for the next 90-calendar-day period that each building continues to meet the definition of a vacant building. At no time may the amount of the penalty exceed $4,500 per building in a calendar year.

2. The penalty imposed pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be in lieu of the administrative citation penalties imposed pursuant to the provisions of PMC 1.20.030.

If a person authorized by the city manager to enforce the provisions of this code determines that a violation of this chapter has occurred, that person shall have the authority to issue an administrative penalty to any person whose acts or omissions have caused or contributed to the violation.

C. Service of Notice. Notice shall be served personally to the owner, or notice shall be posted on the premises and mailed to the owner’s address set forth on the last equalized assessment roll or as known to the enforcement officer. Such notice shall be effective upon mailing or personal service. In addition to the mailed notice, the city shall post conspicuously at least one copy of the notice upon the real property where the vacant building exists. The enforcement officer shall retain in the file a declaration of the person effecting service, declaring the date, time and manner that service was made and the date of posting. A separate notice of violation and penalty shall be issued for each subsequent penalty that may be assessed pursuant to this section.

D. Contents of Notice of Violation and Penalty. The notice of violation shall contain the date of the violation; information identifying the violating property; the amount of the penalty; a description of the penalty payment process, including time for paying the penalty; a description of the administrative penalty review process, including the requirements for requesting a hearing; and the name and signature of the person issuing the notice of violation.

E. Payment of Penalty. The administrative penalty shall be paid to the city within 30 days after the notice of violation is issued, unless a request for hearing pursuant to PMC 15.14.140 is filed in a timely manner.

F. Delinquent Penalties.

2. A solar energy system that conforms to all applicable state fire, structural, electrical, and other building codes as adopted or amended by the city and paragraph (iii) of subdivision (c) of Section 714 of the Civil Code, as such section or subdivision may be amended, renumbered, or redesignated from time to time.

3. A solar energy system that is installed on a single or duplex family dwelling.

4. A solar panel or module array that does not exceed the maximum legal building height as defined by the authority having jurisdiction.

“Solar energy system” has the same meaning set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 801.5 of the Civil Code, as such section or subdivision may be amended, renumbered, or redesignated from time to time.

B. Section 65850.5 of the California Government Code provides that, on or before September 30, 2015, every city, county, or city and county shall adopt an ordinance that creates an expedited, streamlined permitting process for small residential rooftop solar energy systems.

C. Section 65850.5 of the California Government Code provides that in developing an expedited permitting process, the city, county, or city and county shall adopt a checklist of all requirements with which small rooftop solar energy systems shall comply to be eligible for expedited review. The building official is hereby authorized and directed to develop and adopt such checklist. (Note: Your city may adopt an ordinance that modifies the checklists and standards found in the California Solar Permitting Guidebook due to unique climatic, geological, seismological, or topographical conditions.)

D. The checklist shall be published on the city’s Internet website. The applicant may submit the permit application and associated documentation to the city’s building division by personal, mailed, or electronic submittal together with any required permit processing and inspection fees. In the case of electronic submittal, the electronic signature of the applicant on all forms, applications and other documentation may be used in lieu of a wet signature. (Or, if the city will not accept electronic signature, the reasons for the inability to accept electronic signatures must be described.)

E. Prior to submitting an application, the applicant shall:

1. Verify to the applicant’s reasonable satisfaction through the use of standard engineering evaluation techniques that the support structure for the small residential rooftop solar energy system is stable and adequate to transfer all wind, seismic, and dead and live loads associated with the system to the building foundation; and

2. At the applicant’s cost, verify to the applicant’s reasonable satisfaction using standard electrical inspection techniques that the existing electrical system including existing line, load, ground and bonding wiring as well as main panel and subpanel sizes are adequately sized, based on the existing electrical system’s current use, to carry all new photovoltaic electrical loads.

F. For a small residential rooftop solar energy system eligible for expedited review, only one inspection shall be required, which shall be done in a timely manner and may include a consolidated inspection by the building official and fire chief. (Note: A separate fire inspection may be performed if your city does not have an agreement in place with your local fire authority to conduct a fire safety inspection on behalf of the fire authority.) If a small residential rooftop solar energy system fails inspection, a subsequent inspection is authorized; however, the subsequent inspection need not conform to the requirements of this subsection.

G. An application that satisfies the information requirements in the checklist, as determined by the building official, shall be deemed complete. Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the building official shall issue a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance.

H. Upon confirmation by the building official of the application and supporting documentation being complete and meeting the requirements of the checklist, the building official shall administratively approve the application and issue all required permits or authorizations. Such approval does not authorize an applicant to connect the small residential rooftop energy system to the local utility provider’s electricity grid. The applicant is responsible for obtaining such approval or permission from the local utility provider. [Ord. 15-1393 § 2, 2015.]

15.16.070 Expedited electric vehicle charging station permitting.
A. The ordinance codified in this section shall be known as the city of Pittsburg electric vehicle charging station permit expediting ordinance. The terms, phrases, and words used in this section shall be construed in compliance with the definitions set forth by California Government Code Section 65850.7.

B. Electric vehicle charging stations which qualify for expedited permit processing, pursuant to Government Code Section 65850.7, shall be subject to the administrative permitting procedures set forth in this section.

C. Expedited Review Process. Consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, the building official shall implement an expedited administrative permit review process for electric vehicle charging stations, and adopt a checklist of all requirements with which electric vehicle charging stations shall comply in order to be eligible for expedited review. The expedited administrative permit review process and checklist may refer to the recommendations in the checklist prescribed by the most current version of the “Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist” of the “Zero-Emission Vehicles in California: Community Readiness Guidebook” published by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research. The city’s adopted checklist shall be published on the city’s website.

D. Electronic Submittals. Consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, the building official shall allow for electronic submittal of permit applications covered by this section and associated supporting documentation. In accepting such permit applications, the building official shall also accept electronic signatures on all forms, applications, and other documentation in lieu of a wet signature by any applicant.

E. Association Approval. Consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, the building official shall not condition the approval for any electric vehicle charging station permit on the approval of such a system by an association, as that term is defined by Civil Code Section 4080.

F. Permit Application Processing. A permit application that satisfies the information requirements in the city’s adopted checklist shall be deemed complete and be promptly processed. Upon confirmation by the building official that the permit application and supporting documents meet the requirements of the city-adopted checklist, and are consistent with all applicable laws, the building official shall, consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, approve the application and issue all necessary permits. Such approval does not authorize an applicant to energize or utilize the electric vehicle charging station until approval is granted by the city. If the building official determines that the permit application is incomplete, he or she shall issue a written correction notice to the applicant, detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance.

G. Technical Review. It is the intent of this section to encourage the installation of electric vehicle charging stations by removing obstacles to permitting for charging stations so long as the action does not supersede the building official’s authority to address higher priority life-safety situations. If the building official makes a finding based on substantial evidence that the electric vehicle charging station could have a specific adverse impact upon the public health or safety, as defined in Government Code Section 65850.7, the city may require the applicant to apply for a use permit.

As an alternative to mailing, the notice may be posted upon the affected property and published in the jurisdiction, not less than 15 days prior to the date of the abatement hearing. Copies of the notice will be headed with the words “Notice to Abate Weeds and Rubbish” in letters at least one inch high. The notice will be in substantially the following form:

NOTICE TO ABATE WEEDS AND RUBBISH

You are hereby notified that weeds and rubbish constitute a fire hazard on the following described property owned by you:

(Describe property by common street designation, by metes and bounds, Assessor’s code area and parcel number, or by reference to attached map).

You must remove the weeds and rubbish within fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice. If you fail to do so, the (jurisdiction) Fire Protection District will remove it, and the cost of the abatement, including administrative costs, will be collected as property taxes and will be a lien on your property until paid.

You are further notified that the Board of Supervisors has declared that such weeds and rubbish constitute a public nuisance and that such weeds also constitute a seasonal and recurring nuisance.

You may appear before the Board of Fire Commissioners of this jurisdiction on (time and date) at (place-room, street, address, and city) to show cause why this order should not be enforced.

(Signed): (Name of fire code official of name of jurisdiction)

320.5.2 Hearing Date. A date for hearing on the notice will be sent at least 15 days after the date of the notice. The date of the notice is the date on which the notice is placed in the United States mail or the date on which it is posted on the property. At the hearing, the property owner or his agent may appear to show cause why the order should not be enforced. For good cause shown, the Board of Fire Commissioners may extend the time for compliance with the order or may rescind the order.

320.5.3 Contract Award. If the owner fails to comply with the order, the fire code official may have the weeds and rubbish abated either by employees of this jurisdiction or by contract. If a contract is awarded, it will be by public bid, awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. A contract may include work on more than one parcel. Concerning any contract previously awarded as provided in this subsection and that has been fully extended as provided in that contract, it may thereafter be extended on its same terms and conditions for a further period (not to exceed one year) by agreement of the Board of Supervisors and the involved contractor.

320.5.4 Abatement Report of Costs. The fire code official or his or her designee abating the nuisance will keep an account of the cost of abatement in front of or on each separate parcel of land and will render an itemized report in writing to the Board of Fire Commissioners showing the cost of removing the weeds and rubbish on or in front of each separate lot or parcel of land, or both. Before the report is submitted to the Board of Fire Commissioners, a copy of it will be posted for at least three days on or near the chamber door of the Board with a notice of the time and when the report will be submitted to the Board for confirmation. At the time fixed for receiving and considering the report, the Board of Fire Commissioners will hear it and any objections of any of the property owners liable to be assessed for the work of abatement. Thereupon, the Board of Fire Commissioners may make such modifications in the report as it deems necessary, after which the report will be confirmed. The amount of the cost, including administrative costs, of abating the nuisance in front of or upon the various parcels of the land mentioned in the report as confirmed will constitute special assessment against the respective parcels of land, and are a lien on the property for the amount of the respective assessments. Such lien attaches upon recordation, in the office of the County Recorder, of a certified copy of the Resolution of Confirmation.

320.5.5 Cost Assessments. Upon confirmation of the report of cost by the Board of Fire Commissioners and the recordation of the Resolution of Confirmation, a copy of the report of cost will be sent to the County Auditor, who will enter the amount of the assessments against the parcels. Thereafter the amount of the assessments will be collected at the same time and in the same way as County taxes are collected. The owners are subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary county taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of county taxes are applicable to these assessment taxes.

320.6 Alternate Mitigation. In lieu of ordering abatement as provided in Section 320.5.1, the fire code official of this jurisdiction may order the preparation of firebreaks/fuelbreaks around parcels of property where combustible weeds, crops, or brush are present. In determining the proper width for firebreaks/fuelbreaks, the fire code official will consider the height of the growth, weather condition, topography, and the accessibility to the property for fire protection equipment. The procedure set forth in Section 320.5.1 for the abatement of weeds and rubbish shall apply to the preparation of firebreaks/fuelbreaks.

15.80.010 Statutory authorization, finding of fact, purpose and methods.
A. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Pittsburg does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.

B. Finding of Fact.

1. The flood hazard areas of the city of Pittsburg are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

2. These losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to flood losses.

C. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all public and privately owned land within flood-prone, mudslide, mudflow, or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:

1. Protect human life and health;

2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; and

6. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

D. Methods. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:

1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage;

5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. [Ord. 16-1422 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1163 § 1, 1999.]

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance study (FIS) for the city of Pittsburg dated September 30, 2015, with accompanying FIRMs and FBFMs dated September 30, 2015, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. This study and FIRMs are on file at City Hall, 65 Civic Avenue.

C. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Pittsburg from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

D. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

E. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

1. Considered as minimum requirements;

2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

F. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Pittsburg, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

G. Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof, other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

A. Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The city engineer is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions.

B. Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

1. Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine:

a. Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;

b. All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;

c. The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

d. The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Pittsburg; and

e. All letters of map revision (LOMARs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMARs). Approved CLOMARs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

2. Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

a. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining “market value.”

b. Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

3. Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with PMC 15.80.030(B), the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer PMC 15.80.050.

Note: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations” dated July 1995.

3. All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

4. All subdivisions and other proposed development shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

D. Standards for Manufactured Homes.

1. All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on sites located: (a) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (b) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (c) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (d) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood shall, within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s flood insurance rate map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

2. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (D)(1) of this section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the:

a. Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or

b. Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade.

Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

E. Standards for Recreational Vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed in zones A1-30, AH, and AE will either:

1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacked system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or

3. Meet the permit requirements of PMC 15.80.040(C) and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection (D)(1) of this section.

F. Floodways. Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

1. Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Pittsburg.

2. Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city of Pittsburg shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certificate by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the flood discharge.

3. If PMC 15.80.060(A) and (B) are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvements, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. [Ord. 16-1422 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1163 § 1, 1999.]

15.80.060 Variance procedure.
A. Nature of Variances.

1. The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.

2. The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

3. It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.

B. Conditions for Variances.

1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots of existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of PMC 15.80.040 and 15.80.050 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

2. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in PMC 15.08.020) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

3. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to the elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

5. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

a. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and

b. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of Contra Costa County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

6. The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

C. Appeal Board.

1. In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:

a. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

b. Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

c. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

d. Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

e. Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

f. Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

g. Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

h. Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

i. Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

j. Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

k. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

2. Variances shall only be issued upon a:

a. Showing of good and sufficient cause;

b. Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional “hardship” to the applicant; and

c. Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see “public safety and nuisance”), cause “fraud and victimization” of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

3. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsection (C)(1) through (C)(4) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

4. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (B)(1) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. [Ord. 16-1422 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1163 § 1, 1999.]

F. Determination of Contributing and Noncontributing Buildings. In conjunction with the designation of a historic district, the historic resources commission may recommend to the city council, and the council may, by resolution, approve, modify or disapprove the designation of any building within the designated historic district as a contributing building. All other buildings in the district will be considered noncontributing buildings.

G. Amendment or Rescission. An application may be made for the amendment or rescission of designated historic resource status in the same manner and procedure followed for designation.

1. A designation may be amended when the findings required for designation in the first instance may be made with respect to the amended designation.

2. A designation may be rescinded in whole or in part upon one or more of the following findings:

a. The designated historic building, designated historic site, designated historic district, or contributing building or buildings within a district, through demolition, alteration, neglect or loss of integrity, has lost its historic qualities upon which the designation was based; or

b. New information or analysis shows that the designated historic building, designated historic site, or contributing building or buildings within a district was not eligible at the time of its listing which was not discovered through the exercise of due diligence at the time of the original designation; or

c. If it is discovered that the information upon which the historic resources commission or city council made its recommendation and determination regarding designation was false. [Ord. 07-1290 § 4, 2007; Ord. 06-1266 §§ 1, 2, 2006.]

15.84.060 Official local historic register.

The city council, by resolution, may adopt amendments to the design criteria code.

B. The following provisions of law are incorporated by reference into the adopted design guidelines and may be used in reviewing proposed alterations to designated historic resources:

1. The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. These standards and guidelines are a part of the design criteria for the rehabilitation of contributing buildings. These standards are utilized in the review of improvements for certain income tax benefits.

2. State Historic Building Code (State of California Administrative Code, Title 24, Part 8). This regulation deals with as many aspects of alternative approaches to the prevailing codes as possible, including, among other topics, structural, fire, safety, handicapped requirements, and the use of archaic materials.

C. Pursuant to Health and Safety Code Sections 18950 et seq., the State Historic Building Code shall have application only to those buildings designated as historic resources. [Ord. 07-1290 § 4, 2007; Ord. 06-1266 §§ 1, 2, 2006.]

15.84.090 Demolition of historic structures.
A. Notice Required. Demolition, wholly or partially, of a designated historic building or a designated contributing building within a historic district is prohibited unless the proposed demolition is part of a project that has received all entitlements including approved environmental documentation which evaluated the proposed demolition, or if the property owner of such structure gives the city council 180 days’ prior written notice that such act is planned for such structure. Subject to the provisions of subsection (B) of this section, no application to the city for a permit to carry out such demolition shall be accepted during said 180-day notice period.

B. Waiver of Notice. The city council, upon the request of the property owner, may waive the requirement of 180 days’ prior written notice if the action planned for the structure involves:

1. The relocation of the structure to a site in conjunction with a design review application approved by the planning commission; or

2. Relief of extreme financial hardship to the owner of the structure.

C. Waiver of Notice for Emergency. The city planner, upon the request of the property owner, may waive the requirement of 180 days’ prior written notice if, in the opinion of the chief building official, emergency repairs are necessary to remove a dangerous and unsafe condition. [Ord. 07-1290 § 4, 2007; Ord. 06-1266 §§ 1, 2, 2006.]

15.84.100 Substandard buildings.

15.88.060 Grading regulations.
A. General.

1. Grading shall be designed, as far as possible, so that lot lines are at the top of slope and with adequate property line setback from the slope to provide for required vertical slope rounding.

2. Grading shall be designed wherever possible to be at the same elevation or below adjoining properties outside the development so as not to negate the privacy of the adjoining property owners. If it is not possible and there are adjoining properties which will be adversely affected, the developer shall be required to either move the slope onto the adjacent property owner’s land replacing fences and improvements or replace the property owner’s fence (if one exists) at the top of the slope and deed the slope to the property owner. The city may waive this requirement wherein the adversely affected property owner fails to negotiate for either option.

3. Stockpiling of materials shall be subject to city approval and shall be removed or relocated when required for public health or safety.

4. All graded surfaces and materials, whether filled, excavated, transported or stockpiled, shall be wetted, protected or contained in such a manner as to prevent any nuisance from dust, or spillage upon adjoining property or streets. Equipment and materials on the site should be used in such a manner as to avoid excessive dust.

5. All grading and noise therefrom, including, but not limited to, warming of equipment motors in residential zones, or within 1,000 feet of any residential occupancy, hotel, motel or hospital shall be limited between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays, unless other hours are approved by the city engineer, upon receipt of evidence that an emergency exists which would constitute a hazard to persons or property.

6. Whenever any portion of the work requires entry onto adjacent property for any reason, the permit applicant shall obtain a right of entry from the adjacent property owner or his authorized representative in a form acceptable to the city, and shall file a copy of the fully executed right of entry with the city prior to issuance of the grading permit and/or approval of the grading plans.

B. Setbacks.

1. The tops and toes of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from property lines and structures as far as necessary to provide for safety of adjacent property, safety of pedestrians and vehicular traffic, required slope rounding, adequate foundation support, required swales, berms and drainage facilities and applicable zoning requirements. Except for pier-type foundations or other special foundation design, setbacks shall be not less than shown in Figure “A.”



2. The setbacks and other restrictions specified by this section are minimum and may be increased by the building official or by the recommendations of a civil engineer, soils engineer or engineering geologist, if necessary, for safety and stability or to prevent damage of adjacent properties from deposition or erosion or to provide access for slope maintenance and drainage. Retaining walls may be used to reduce the required setbacks when approved by the building official.

C. Preparation of Ground. The ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill by removing vegetation, noncomplying fill, topsoil and other unsuitable materials scarifying to provide a bond with the new fill, and where slopes are steeper than five to one, and the height is greater than five feet, by benching into sound bedrock or other competent material as determined by the soils engineer. The bench under the toe of a fill on a slope steeper than five to one shall be at least 10 feet wide. The area beyond the toe of fill shall be sloped for sheet overflow or a paved drain shall be provided. Where fill is to be placed over a cut, the bench under the toe of fill shall be at least 10 feet wide, but the cut must be made before placing fill and approved by the soils engineer and engineering geologist as suitable foundation for fill. Unsuitable soil is soil which, in the opinion of the city or the civil engineer or the soils engineer or the geologist, is not competent to support other soil or fill, to support structures or to satisfactorily perform the other functions for which the soil is intended.

D. Cut and Fill Slopes.

1. Cut and fill slopes shall be in general, no steeper than is safe for the intended use or is necessary to ensure the protection and safety of adjacent properties.

2. Unless recommended otherwise by the soils engineer, and approved by the city, the steepness of cut or fill slopes shall not exceed two horizontal to one vertical.

3. The height of cut and fill slopes (including retaining walls) and the maximum depth of cut or fill shall not exceed that which is shown on the approved hillside planned development permit.

4. Guidelines for vertical slope rounding shall be in accordance with details as approved by the city engineer.

5. Cut and fill slopes shall be contour rounded as approved by the city during the various stages of approval.

2. No grading shall be conducted as to cause erosion or flooding of any natural drainage way.

3. Sediment basins, as required by the interim and final erosion and sediment control plans, shall be constructed to detain runoff and trap sediment. Temporary sediment basin dams and collected silt shall then be removed and the resulting material hauled from the site or used as topsoil.

4. The faces of cut and fill slopes shall be prepared and maintained to control against erosion and to return the slope to its natural appearance as near as possible. The protection for the slopes shall be installed as soon as practicable and prior to calling for final approval. The planting shall be so timed that ground covers will not be washed out by rains nor burned due to lack of water. Where necessary, check dams, cribbing, rip rap and other devices or methods shall be employed to control erosion and to provide safety.

5. All exposed or finished banks or slopes of any fill or excavation shall be protected from erosion by approved planting, irrigation, hydroseeding, cribbing, walls or terracing or a combination thereof. All graded surfaces exceeding 5,000 square feet in area shall be planted and irrigated, paved or built upon and shall be provided with berms and approved drainage facilities adequate to prevent erosion and to conduct the accumulation of runoff of surface waters to an approved place of discharge. It is the intent of this section to prohibit the abandonment of graded areas or slopes which are not provided with erosion protection and adequate drainage facilities, even though all other requirements in this section have been provided and approved.

G. Drainage.

1. General.

a. All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry waters to the nearest practicable drainageway approved by the city and/or other appropriate jurisdiction as a safe place to deposit such waters. Erosion of ground in the area of discharge shall be prevented by installation of nonerosive downdrain or other devices.

b. All building sites shall be graded and sloped away from the building foundation with a minimum slope of two percent for a distance of 10 feet on all sides of every building, except where yard requirements are less than 20 feet, in which case the soil shall be graded away from the foundation to a minimum of two-tenths of one foot in elevation at a distance not less than one-half the required yard width.

c. Lot drainage shall be directed toward approved drainage facilities at a minimum gradient of one and one-half percent. The gradient from the building pad may be one percent if all the following conditions exist throughout the building area:

i. No proposed fills are greater than 10 feet in maximum depth;

ii. No proposed finish cut or fill slope faces have a vertical height in excess of 10 feet;

iii. No existing slope faces have a slope face steeper than 10 horizontal to one vertical.

2. Terraces.

a. Terraces at least six feet in width shall be established at not more than 30-foot vertical intervals to control surface drainage and debris on cut or fill slopes. For cut or fill slopes greater than 60 feet and up to 120 feet in vertical height, one terrace at approximately mid-height shall be 12 feet in width. Terrace widths and spacing for cut and fill slopes greater than 120 feet in height shall be designed by the civil engineer and approved by the city.

b. Suitable access shall be provided to permit proper cleaning and maintenance.

3. Interceptor Ditches.

a. Interceptor ditches shall be installed where necessary to protect slopes from surface runoff. They shall be designed for the anticipated runoff from a 25-year design storm and paved with portland cement to a minimum three-inch thickness and a 32-inch top width. The minimum depth at the center shall be one foot or as required for a minimum of three-inch free board during the 25-year design storm.

b. The minimum gradient of interceptor ditches shall be one percent and no single run shall collect runoff from a tributary area exceeding 15,000 square feet (horizontal projection) without discharging into an approved down drain.

4. Trash Racks. Properly designed trash racks shall be installed on the upstream end of storm drain pipes where that pipe accepts drainage from a waterway which is not to be undergrounded. These racks are to be constructed so as to preclude large debris and small children from being pulled into the pipe from heavy storm flows. The city may require the installation of trash racks at other locations as deemed necessary for proper maintenance and safety.

H. Wet Season Work.

1. For commencement of the activity during the wet season, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city engineer, that land disturbance is relatively minor and that erosion and sedimentation can be controlled.

2. For continuation of activities, other than installation, maintenance or repair of measures in the interim or final plans, during the wet season, the permittee must apply for and receive, every five working days, special permission to proceed. The request shall be accompanied by a recommendation from the soils engineer for continuation of the work.

3. The city engineer may grant permission under this section on the basis of weather forecasts, recommendation of the soils engineer, experience and other pertinent factors which indicate the activity may commence or continue without erosion and/or sedimentation occurring.

4. The applicant/permittee’s failure to obtain permission for wet season activity shall result in the imposition of suspension/revocation, and action against the security or criminal penalties as described herein.

5. The city engineer may prohibit the activity during the months in which he/she finds that rainfall will likely preclude compliance with these recommendations.

I. Modifications.

1. Modifications to the specific grading regulations in this section may be approved or required by the city upon finding that such modification:

a. Is necessary to preserve existing natural features, such as trees, streams, hills, significant vegetation or rock outcroppings, etc.; or

b. Will reduce the adverse visual impacts of cut and fill operations.

2. For subdivisions of five or more units, this finding must be made by the planning commission and/or the city council at the time of approval of the tentative map or hillside planned development permit.

3. For all other grading where a grading permit is required, the finding must be made by the city engineer.

4. When a soils report is required for the proposed grading, the modifications shall be subject to approval by the soils engineer. [Ord. 856 § 1, 1984.]

15.90.010 Findings and purpose.
A. In order to implement the goals of the circulation element of the city’s general plan and, more specifically, the transportation improvements contained in the capital improvement program, and to mitigate the transportation impacts caused by new development in the city, certain public road improvements must be or had to be constructed. The city council has determined that a transportation mitigation fee is needed to finance these public improvements and to pay for new development’s fair share of the construction costs of these improvements. In establishing the fee described in this chapter, the city council has found the fee to be consistent with its general plan and, pursuant to Government Code Section 64913.2, has considered the effects of the fee with respect to regional housing needs and the city’s housing needs as established in the housing element of the general plan.

B. The purpose of this chapter is to implement the general plan requirements set forth in subsections (A) and (B) of this section and, under the authority of Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution, to impose a transportation mitigation fee to fund the cost of certain facilities and services, the demand for which is directly or indirectly generated by the type and level of new development proposed in the city general plan.

C. It is the further purpose of this chapter to require that adequate provision is made for developer-financed facilities and services within the city limits as a condition to the approval of new development.

D. A transportation mitigation fee is hereby established on issuance of a building permit for development in the city to pay for transportation improvements. The city council shall, in a council resolution, set forth the specific amount of the fee, describe the benefit and impact area on which the fee is imposed, list the specific transportation improvements to be financed, describe the estimated cost of these facilities, describe the reasonable relationship between this fee and the various type of new developments and set forth time for payment.

E. The specific transportation improvements to be financed by the fee are described in the most recent “Pittsburg Local Transportation Mitigation Fee (LTMF) Program Update,” adopted by council resolution and on file with the city clerk.

F. New development will generate new trips which must be accommodated by transportation facilities. The amount of trips generated and, therefore, the benefit gained, varies according to the kind or use. Therefore, a “dwelling unit equivalent” (DUE) factor was developed to convert the new trip generation rates for each general plan land use into as ratio of the particular use’s rate to the rate associated with a low-density, single-family dwelling unit. It follows that the fee per unit of development is directly proportional to the DUE associated with each particular use. [Ord. 06-1281 § 2, 2007; Ord. 1033 § 1, 1992.]

15.90.020 Definitions.

D. “City of Pittsburg” means all property located within the geographical area within the city of Pittsburg sphere of influence.

E. “Department” means the engineering department.

F. “Director” means the city engineer.

G. “Dwelling unit equivalent factor (DUE)” is a conversion factor used to reflect the new traffic generation intensity and roadway use, for each land use, with respect to the same characteristics for a low-density, single-family detached dwelling unit in a residential use category (“RL” low density) based on the Pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study.

H. “Estimated cost” means the total estimated cost of constructing a facility, as set forth in the city traffic mitigation fee study.

I. “Facilities” means those public facilities described in the Pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study.

J. “Mitigation fee” means the fee levied by this chapter upon the issuance of a building permit.

K. “Pittsburg roadway and transit fund” means that special interest-bearing trust fund established under PMC 15.90.030.

15.90.080 Credit and reimbursement for construction of facilities.
A. Upon application by the property owner, the director may authorize the owner to construct certain on-site and off-site roadway and transit facilities specified in the Pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study, or portions thereof, as designated in the Study, in lieu of all, or a portion of, the fee required by this chapter. The owner is entailed to a credit if the owner (1) constructs the improvements, (2) finances an improvement by cash, assessment district, or Mello-Roos community facilities district, or (3) a combination of the above. If so authorized, the credit to be provided to the property owner shall be equal to the estimated cost of the facility as set forth in the then current Pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study, including, but not limited to, unit prices, quantities and project descriptions. The construction of a facility authorized by this section must be approved by the city, and conducted in accordance with the city’s roadway development standards. The property owner must post a bond or other security in a form acceptable to the director for the complete performance of the construction, before credit is given and before issuance of a building permit.

B. The owner is not entitled to a credit for the dedication of land, except to the extent that right-of-way or land acquisition costs were included in the estimated cost for the improvement as described in the Pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study or any updates.

C. If the amount of the credit is less than the amount of the otherwise applicable fee, the property owner shall pay the difference.

D. If the amount of the credit is greater than the amount of the otherwise applicable transportation mitigation fee, the property owner shall be paid the difference only from the Pittsburg roadway and transit fund, after the project is accepted by the city, as described in the Pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study or any updates.

To implement this subsection (D), the property owner and the city shall first enter into a reimbursement agreement. In addition to its other terms, the agreement shall provide that: (1) the general fund of the city is not liable for payment of any obligations arising from the agreement; (2) the credit or taxing power of the city is not pledged for the payment of any obligations arising from the agreement; (3) the land owner shall not compel the exercise of the city taxing power or the forfeiture of any of its property to satisfy any obligations arising from the agreement; and (4) the obligation arising from the agreement is not a debt of the city, nor a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien, or encumbrance, upon any of its property, or upon any of its income, receipts, or revenues, and is payable only from the development fees deposited in the Pittsburg roadway and transit fund; and (5) the amount of reimbursement at any one time from the fund shall not exceed that portion of the fund which represents the same percentage as the percentage obtained by comparing the amount of fees in the study allocable to the project to the total fees to be collected under the program. (Example: If the project subject to reimbursement was to receive 10 percent of the total fees collected under the program, reimbursement at any point in time to the property owner could not exceed 10 percent of the fees actually collected.) Nothing in this section shall preclude the city or redevelopment agency from voluntarily contributing additional funds other than those contained in the Pittsburg roadway and transit fund for the purpose of constructing roadway and transit facilities described in the Pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study.

E. The construction of facilities by a private owner under this section shall be performed and contracted for only as required by law, including but not limited to compliance with the city standards, and requirements for public works, if applicable to the particular facility.

F. Nothing in this chapter shall require use of the city’s public bidding procedures in the construction of facilities by a private owner under this section, unless otherwise required by state or federal law. [Ord. 1033 § 1, 1992.]

15.90.090 Other authority.
This chapter is intended to establish a supplemental method for funding the cost of certain facilities and services the demand for which will be generated by the level and type of development proposed in the Pittsburg general plan. The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to limit the power of the city council to impose any other fee or exactions or to continue to impose existing ones on development within the city but shall be in addition to any other requirements which the city council is authorized to impose, or has previously imposed within the city. In particular, individual property owners shall remain obligated to fund, construct, and/or dedicate the improvements, public facilities and other exactions required by the city, including without limitation those required by the city standard details and specifications and other applicable public works standards. Any credits or reimbursements under PMC 15.90.080 shall not include the funding, construction or dedications described in this subsection. [Ord. 1033 § 1, 1992.]

15.90.100 Findings regarding use of fees.
A. As required under Government Code Section 66001(d), the city shall make findings once each fiscal year (commencing in August, 1993) with respect to any portion of the fee remaining unexpended or uncommitted in its account five or more years after deposit of the fee, to identify the purpose to which the fee is to be put and demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was charged.

B. As required under Government Code Section 66001(e), the city shall refund to the current record owner on a prorated basis the unexpended or uncommitted portion of the fee, and any interest accrued thereon, for which need cannot be established. The manner or making a refund may be by direct payment, a temporary suspension of fees, or by other means consistent with the intent of Government Code Section 66001(e). [Ord. 1033 § 1, 1992.]

15.90.110 Fee adjustment or waiver.
A. The developer of a project subject to a fee under this chapter may apply to the director for an adjustment to or waiver of that fee. The waiver of this fee shall be based upon the absence of any reasonable relationship between the impact on public facilities of that development and either the amount of fee charged or the type of facilities to be financed.

B. The application shall be made in writing and filed with the development permit application for the project. If no development permit is required, the application for a fee adjustment or waiver shall be made with the application for a building permit. The application shall state in detail the factual basis and legal theory for the claim of adjustment or waiver.

C. The director shall consider the application at an informal hearing held within 60 days after the filing of the fee adjustment application. The director and applicant may agree to extend the time for hearing. The decision of the director is appealable pursuant to PMC 15.90.120.

D. The applicant bears the burden of proof in presenting substantial evidence to support the application. The director shall consider the following factors in his determination whether or not to approve a fee adjustment or waiver:

1. The factors identified in Government Code Section 66001:

a. The purposes and proposed uses of the fee,

b. The type of development,

c. The relationship between: the fee’s use and type of development; the need for the improvements and the type of development; and the amount of the fee and the cost of the public facility or the portion of it attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed; and

2. The substance and nature of the evidence including the Pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study and the applicant’s technical data supporting its request. The applicant must present comparable technical information to show that the fee in inappropriate for the particular development. [Ord. 1033 § 1, 1992.]

15.90.120 Appeal procedure.
A. The director is responsible for administering, collecting, crediting, adjusting, and refunding development fees. Any administrative decision by the director regarding a fee imposed under this chapter is appealable in accordance with this section. A person seeking judicial review shall first seek an appeal hearing under this section.

B. A person appealing a decision under this chapter shall file a request with the director who is responsible for processing the appeal. The appeal shall be in writing, stating the factual and legal grounds, and shall be filed within 10 calendar days following the decision being appealed.

C. The director shall notify the city manager of the appeal. The manager shall set the matter for hearing before the city council within 60 calendar days after the date of the notice of appeal, and shall notify the person appealing in writing of the time and place of the hearing.

D. The city council shall conduct the hearing, prepare written findings of fact and a written decision on the matter, and shall preserve the complete administrative record of the proceeding. The council shall consider relevant evidence presented by the appellant and by the director.

E. The decision of the city council is final; it is reviewable by a court under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5.

F. The city hereby adopts Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 for the purposes of judicial review under this section. A petition seeking review of a decision under this chapter shall be filed not later than the nintieth day following the date on which the decision of the hearing officer (or city council in the event of an appeal) becomes final. [Ord. 1033 § 1, 1992.]

15.90.130 Compliance with Government Code Section 66001.
The Pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study contains information and analysis which the council finds provides substantial evidence for each of the following findings:

A. The purpose of the fee adopted by this chapter is to provide a source of funding which will be used to construct roadway projects to mitigate citywide traffic impacts associated with new development occurring between 1990 and 2005 within the city’s sphere of influence.

B. The fee will be used to construct roadway projects throughout the city, including street widening and improvements, traffic signalizations, new road extensions and connections, overcrossings, grade separations and similar improvements. The project list in Section V of the traffic mitigation fee study was used as a basis for estimating costs, but is not intended as a limitation on the projects for which the fee can be used.

C. Each of the types of development projects upon which the traffic fee is imposed contributes to the increase in traffic congestion which is projected for the city. The relationship between the level of traffic impacts and the type of land uses upon which the fee is imposed is based on trip generation rates published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers for 1987 for each type of land use studied. The study also relied upon the Pittsburg Transportation Mitigation Fee Study, 1989. This is described in more detail in Appendix B of the 1992 traffic mitigation fee study. Since the fee will be used for roadway improvement projects which will mitigate these citywide traffic impacts, the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the fee (roadway improvements) and the type of development projects (residential, commercial and industrial) on which the fee is imposed.

D. Currently there is traffic congestion in the city, and this congestion will continue to increase due to the development that is expected to occur in Pittsburg and Eastern Contra Costa County. The need for the planned traffic model projections and the decreased volume to capacity ratios. The improvements will increase the capacity of the transportation system to maintain the existing volume to capacity ratios. Without the projects, there will be a degradation in the volume to capacity ratios. These projections are presented in Section III of the traffic mitigation fee study and in its attachments. Based upon this data, the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the roadway improvements and types of development projects on which the fee is imposed.

E. The traffic impact fee is being imposed on 12 types of development projects. For each of those types of projects, the traffic mitigation fee study calculated the appropriate fee amount based upon current estimates for anticipated project costs and the types of future growth projected by ABAG for the Pittsburg sphere of influence. These calculations are presented in Table 3 of the study. The distribution of the costs are based on trip generation rates for each land use classification which contributes to the degradation in volume to capacity ratios. The cost of maintaining the volume to capacity ratios has been attributed by development type according to its relative contribution to the degradation in the ratio. Based upon this data and calculations, the city council finds that the amount of fees attributable to the types of developments on which the fee is imposed represents a fair and reasonable distribution of the cost of the public facilities for each type of development project used in the study. [Ord. 1033 § 1, 1992.]

15.90.140 Regional transportation mitigation fee.
In the event that any provision of Chapter 15.100 PMC (Regional Transportation Mitigation Fee) is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the Pittsburg traffic mitigation fee study adopted under PMC 15.90.050 shall be amended to include the “Development Program Report for the Eastern Contra Costa Sub-Regional Transportation Mitigation Fee,” prepared by and for the Contra Costa public works department, dated March 8, 1994, and any updates, revisions or amendments thereto. Furthermore, the regional transportation mitigation fee shall be deemed to be an increase in the existing traffic mitigation fee imposed under PMC 15.90.060 and any amendments thereto.

15.96.060    Requirements for construction.

15.96.010 Background.
The city council finds that in order to preserve the public safety it is necessary to provide bus turnouts and shelters along arterial and other major streets within the city. Bus turnouts provide added traffic safety and the turnouts and shelters help to encourage the use of public transit, thus decreasing traffic congestion. [Ord. 941 § 1, 1987.]

15.96.020 Definitions.
In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires:

A. “Arterial street” means an arterial street as designated on the city’s general plan, a specific plan, or transportation plan;

B. “Bus shelter” means an enclosure designed to protect passengers waiting for buses;

C. “Bus turnout” means an inset of the curb, gutter and sidewalk to allow buses to stop and discharge and receive passengers so that the travel lane of a street is not blocked by the bus;

D. “Director” means the city’s community services director or his designate;

E. “Transit district” means the Eastern Contra Costa County Transit District. [Ord. 941 § 1, 1987.]

15.96.030 Developments – Notice to transit district.
The director shall notify the transit district whenever the city receives an application for any of the following types of development:

A. Housing project with 50 or more units which is adjacent to an arterial street;

B. Commercial or industrial project which is adjacent to an arterial street;

C. One of the above types of projects which is adjacent to a street not designated as an arterial but which is likely to be serviced by a bus route and where buses would pose a substantial traffic hazard if stopped in the traffic lane for passengers. [Ord. 941 § 1, 1987.]

15.96.040 Determination of review by district.
The transit district shall review each project which is referred to it by the city and, within 15 days of receipt of the referral, notify the city whether a bus turnout or a bus shelter or both should be required to be constructed in conjunction with the project. The determination shall be based upon the existence of a bus route on an adjacent street or the likelihood that a route will be created along said street. If the transit district finds that a bus stop at the subject location is or would be desirable, it shall notify the director to require installation of the turnout or shelter. [Ord. 941 § 1, 1987.]

15.96.050 Failure of district to respond.
If the district fails to respond to the referral within 15 days as specified in PMC 15.96.040, the city may consider the requirement for a bus turnout or shelter waived. However, if the transit district subsequently affirmatively responds, and if there is sufficient time to incorporate design of the improvements into the developer’s application and plans, then the director may require the facility. [Ord. 941 § 1, 1987.]

15.96.060 Requirements for construction.
If the transit district requests construction of a bus turnout or shelter the director of public works shall make construction of it a condition of approval of the development project. However, a failure of the city to so require because of error or omission does not create liability of the city to the transit district. Construction of the improvements shall be in conformance with specifications approved by the director and the transit district. [Ord. 941 § 1, 1987.]

A. Projected new development in the cities of Pittsburg, Antioch, Brentwood and the eastern portion of the county of Contra Costa (the “regional area”) will further congest the eastern portion of the roadways and thoroughfares and increase traffic delays. The construction of bridge and major roadway improvements is necessary to mitigate the transportation impacts caused by such new development.

B. The city of Pittsburg (“the city”) is entering into a joint powers agreement with Contra Costa County, the city of Antioch and the city of Brentwood for the purpose of generating and pooling funds to finance transportation improvements within the regional area (the “JPA”). Under the terms of the JPA, each party is committed to contributing funds towards construction of transportation improvements described in the “Development Program Report for the Eastern Contra Costa Sub-Regional Transportation Mitigation Fee,” prepared by and for the Contra Costa public works department, dated March 8, 1994, (the “development program report”).

C. In accordance with the JPA, the city council finds that imposition of a regional transportation mitigation fee is necessary to finance transportation improvements and to pay for new development’s fair share of the construction costs of these improvements. The city council shall, by resolution, set forth the specific amount of the fee, describe the benefit and impact area on which the fee is imposed, list the specific transportation improvements to be financed, describe the estimated cost of these facilities, describe the reasonable relationship between this fee and the various types of new development and set forth the time of payment.

D. The specific transportation improvements to be financed by the fee are described in the development program report on file with the city clerk and which the council hereby approves. The costs of the transportation improvements are uniformly distributed per each dwelling unit or each square foot of building space throughout the entire regional area, with the fees assessed to the various land use categories in proportion to the number of daily trips generated.

15.100.060 Credit and reimbursement for construction of facilities.
A. Upon application by the property owner and upon approval under the JPA, the director may authorize the owner to construct certain on-site and off-site transportation improvements specified in the development program report, or portions thereof, as designated in the report, in lieu of all or a portion of the fee required by this chapter. The owner is entitled to a credit if the owner: (1) constructs the improvements, (2) finances an improvement by cash, assessment district, Mello-Roos community facilities district, or (3) a combination of the above. If so authorized, the credit to be provided to the property owner shall be equal to the estimated cost of the improvement as set forth in the then current development program report, including but not limited to unit prices, quantities and project descriptions. The construction of an improvement authorized by this section must be approved by the city and conducted in accordance with the city’s roadway development standards. The property owner must post a bond or other security in a form acceptable to the director for the complete performance of the construction, before credit is given and before issuance of a building permit.

B. The owner is not entitled to a credit for the dedication of land, except as authorized under the JPA.

C. If the amount of the credit is less than the amount of the otherwise applicable fee, the property owner shall pay the difference.

D. If the amount of the credit is greater than the amount of the otherwise applicable regional transportation mitigation fee, the property owner shall be paid the difference only from the Pittsburg regional transit fund, after the project is accepted under the JPA, as described in the development project report or any updates.

To implement this subsection, the property owner and the city shall first enter into a reimbursement agreement, subject to any necessary approval under the JPA. In addition to its other terms, the agreement shall provide that: (1) the general fund of the city is not liable for payment of any obligations arising from the agreement; (2) the credit or taxing power of the city is not pledged for payment of any obligations arising from the agreement; (3) the property owner shall not compel the exercise of the city taxing power or the forfeiture of any of its property to satisfy any obligations arising from the agreement; and (4) the obligation arising from the agreement is not a debt of the city, nor a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance, upon any of its property, or upon any of its income, receipts or revenue, and is payable only from the development fee deposited into the Pittsburg regional transit fund; or other funds available under and through the JPA. Nothing in this section shall preclude the city or redevelopment agency from voluntarily contributing additional funds other than those contained in the Pittsburg regional transit fund for the purpose of constructing transportation improvements described in the development program report.

E. The construction of improvements by a private owner under this section shall be performed and contracted for only as required by law, including but not limited to compliance with the city standards, and requirements of public works, if applicable to the particular improvement.

F. Nothing in this chapter shall require use of the city’s public bidding procedures in the construction of improvements by a private owner under this section, unless otherwise required by state or federal law. [Ord. 1083 § 1, 1994.]

15.100.070 Other authority.
This chapter is intended to establish a supplemental method for funding the cost of certain improvements and services the demand which will be generated by the level and type of development anticipated in the Pittsburg general plan. The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to limit the power of the city council to impose any other fee or exactions or to continue to impose existing ones on development within the city but shall be in addition to any other requirements which the city council is authorized to impose, or has previously imposed, within the city. In particular individual property owners shall remain obligated to fund, construct and/or dedicate the improvements, public facilities and other exactions required by the city, including without limitation those required by the city standard details and specifications and other applicable public works standards. Any credits or reimbursements under PMC 15.100.060 shall not include the funding, construction or dedications described in this section. [Ord. 1083 § 1, 1994.]

15.100.080 Findings regarding use of fees.
A. As required under Government Code Section 66001(d), the city shall make findings once each fiscal year (commencing on or about August, 1995) with respect to any portion of the fee remaining unexpended or uncommitted in its account five or more years after deposit of the fee, to identify the purpose to which the fee is to be put and demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was charged.

B. As required under Government Code Section 66001(e), and subject to the JPA, the city shall refund to the current record owner on a prorated basis the unexpended or uncommitted portion of the fee, and any interest accrued thereon, for which need cannot be established. The manner of making a refund may be by direct payment, a temporary suspension of fees, or by other means consistent with the intent of Government Code Section 66001 (e). No refund shall be made available from JPA funds. [Ord. 1083 § 1, 1994.]

15.100.090 Fee adjustment or waiver.
A. The developer of a project subject to a fee under this chapter may apply to the director for an adjustment to or waiver of that fee. The waiver of this fee shall be based upon the absence of any reasonable relationship between the impact on transportation facilities of that development and either the amount of fee charged or the type of improvements to be financed.

B. The application shall be made in writing and filed with the development permit application for the project. If no development permit is required, the application for a fee adjustment or waiver shall be made with the application for a building permit. The application shall state in detail the factual basis and legal theory for the claim of adjustment or waiver.

C. The director shall consider the application at an informal hearing held within 60 days after the filing of the fee adjustment application. The director and applicant may agree to extend the time for hearing. The decision of the director is appealable pursuant to PMC 15.100.100.

D. The applicant bears the burden of proof in presenting substantial evidence to support the application. The director shall consider the following factors in his determination whether or not to approve a fee adjustment or waiver:

1. The factors identified in Government Code Section 66001;

a. The purposes and proposed uses of the fee,

b. The type of development,

c. The relationship between: the fee’s use and the type of development; the need for the improvements and the type of development; and the amount of the fee and the cost of the public facility or the portion attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed; and

2. The substance and nature of the evidence including the development program report and the applicant’s technical data supporting its request. The applicant must present comparable technical information to show that the fee is inappropriate for the particular development. [Ord. 1083 § 1, 1994.]

15.100.100 Appeal procedure.
A. The director is responsible for administering, collecting, crediting, adjusting and refunding development fees. Any administrative decision by the director regarding a fee imposed under this chapter is appealable in accordance with this section. A person seeking judicial review shall first seek an appeal hearing under this section.

D. The city council shall conduct the hearing, prepare written findings of fact and a written decision on the matter, and shall preserve the complete administrative record of the proceeding. The council shall consider relevant evidence presented by the appellant and by the director. The council may defer a decision until after consultation with the JPA governing board, as provided in subsection (G) of this section.

E. The decision of the city council is final, subject to the jurisdiction if any of the JPA governing board, and reviewable by a court under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5.

F. The city adopts Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 for the purposes of judicial review under this section. A petition seeking review of a decision under this chapter shall be filed not later than the ninetieth day following the date on which the decision of the hearing officer (or city council in the event of an appeal) becomes final.

G. An application or appeal under this section shall be subject to review under the JPA by the JPA’s governing boards, as necessary under the terms of the JPA. [Ord. 1083 § 1, 1994.]

15.100.110 Compliance with Government Code Section 66001.
The development program report contains information and analysis which the council finds provides substantial evidence for each of the following findings:

A. The purpose of the fee adopted by this chapter is to provide a source of funding which will be used to construct transportation improvements to mitigate citywide traffic impacts associated with new development occurring between 1994 and 2005.

B. The fee will be used to construct transportation improvements such as the construction of additional lanes, improved median barriers, wider medians, and HOV and mixed flow lanes on projects in the regional area, including construction of the Buchanan Road Bypass, improvements to State Route 4 between Bailey Road and the State Route 4/160 Junction, and construction of the State Route 4 Bypass (or the Delta Expressway). The project list on page 3 of the development program report was used as a basis for estimating costs, but is not intended as a limitation on the projects for which the fee can be imposed. Such projects shall be as determined under the JPA.

C. There is a reasonable relationship between the fee’s use and the type of development projects on which the fee is imposed in that the types of development projects subject to the fee will generate additional traffic which will increase delays and further congest bridges and roadways in the regional area. The additional traffic created by the development projects will result in a need to expand, extend and improve existing transportation facilities and a need to construct new facilities to mitigate the adverse traffic affects that would otherwise result from such development projects. Since the fee will be used for transportation improvements which will mitigate impacts and reduce traffic congestion and delays, and improve noise and air quality citywide and throughout the regional area, the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the fee (transportation improvements) and the type of development projects (residential, commercial and industrial) on which the fee is imposed.

D. State Route 4 between Bailey Road in Pittsburg and the State Route 4/160 Junction in Antioch is a major access route for traffic throughout the regional area. Travelers on Route 4 currently experience significant congestion and delays which are expected to increase significantly in severity as the result of projected development. Expansion of Route 4 and construction of related improvements to Junction 4/160 will increase the flow of traffic, reduce congestion, delays and noise, and improve air quality citywide and throughout the regional area. Based upon this data, the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the Route 4 expansion and related improvements to Junction 4/160 and the types of projects on which the fee is imposed.

E. The construction of a new access route known as State Route 4 Bypass (or the Delta Expressway) extending from the Junction of 4/160 in Antioch to Highway 4 south of Brentwood will reduce congestion and traffic, decrease delays and noise and improve air quality throughout the regional area. Based upon this data, the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between construction of the State Route 4 Bypass (or the Delta Expressway) and the types of projects on which the fee is imposed.

F. Buchanan Road is a heavily used thoroughfare for commuter traffic accessing homes and jobs located within the regional area. Buchanan Road is currently exceeding its capacity and travelers frequently experience delays and congestion which are expected to increase in severity as a result of projected development. Construction of the Buchanan Road Bypass extending Sommersville Road to Kirker Pass Road in Pittsburg will reduce congestion, decrease travel time and noise and improve air quality citywide and throughout the regional area. Based upon this data, the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between construction of the Buchanan Road Bypass and the types of projects on which the fee is imposed.

G. The regional transportation mitigation fee is being imposed on five types of development projects. For each of those types of projects, the development program report calculated the appropriate fee amount based upon projected development and a trip generation factor designated for each of the five types of development projects. These factors were determined utilizing the Institute of Transportation Engineers (“ITE”), Trip Generation Manual, 4th Edition and results of the East County Traffic Model. The Traffic Model indicates that nonresidential development may reduce the impact on the projects by creating a better employment/housing balance. As a result, the proposed fee is directly related to traffic generated by each particular land use with nonresidential trip generation factors significantly reduced to approximately one tenth of the standard values in the ITE manual. Based upon this data and calculations, the city council finds that the amount of fees attributable to the types of development on which the fee is imposed represents a fair and reasonable distribution of the cost of the transportation improvements for each type of development project used in the development program report. [Ord. 1083 § 1, 1994.]

15.100.120 Challenge to regional transportation mitigation fee.
Any person desiring to challenge the regional transportation mitigation fee imposed under this chapter shall comply with all of the procedural requirements contained in Government Code Sections 66020, et seq. [Ord. 1083 § 1, 1994.]

15.100.130 Severability.
In the event that any provision of this chapter is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the city council expressly states its intention that the regional transportation mitigation fee shall be deemed an increase in the existing transportation mitigation fee imposed under Chapter 15.90 PMC. [Ord. 1083 § 1, 1994.]

15.102.010 Findings and purpose.
A. Projected new development in the cities of Pittsburg, Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley and the unincorporated eastern portion of Contra Costa County (the “regional area”) will further congest the freeways and arterial roadways and place additional demand on the regional transportation system.

B. The cities of Antioch, Brentwood, Pittsburg, and Oakley together with the county of Contra Costa, entered into an agreement pursuant to California Government Code Section 6500 et seq., entitled “East Contra Costa Regional Fee and Financing Authority Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement” (the “agreement”), which provides for the creation of a separate joint powers agency (“ECCRFFA”), to assist in the establishment of a uniform regional development fee program and the funding and implementation of transportation improvement projects in the east county area. The four cities listed above and the county are the “member agencies” of ECCRFFA.

C. ECCRFFA’s purposes are as follows:

1. To establish a uniform regional development fee program (“fee program”) within the region, and to coordinate planning and implementation of the fee program within a single public agency;

2. To identify projects to be funded by the fee program solely or in conjunction with other funding sources;

3. To establish funding goals for identified projects, and to seek commitments from the member agencies regarding funding for the projects;

4. To establish an implementation schedule for the projects;

5. To establish fee collection, financing, and management mechanisms, and to formalize institutional arrangements for the implementation of the fee program.

D. In furtherance of its purposes and goals, ECCRFFA has adopted a comprehensive fee program to help fund regional transportation improvements which are necessary to offset the impacts of continuing growth and development in the areas of each of the member agencies. Expansion and construction of the improvements identified in the East Contra Costa regional fee program update report (“ECCRFFA Fee Program Report”), approved by ECCRFFA in June 2005, will increase the flow of traffic, reduce congestion and noise, and improve safety and air quality throughout the regional area.

E. Pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act, California Government Code Section 66000, et seq., a local agency is authorized to charge a fee to development applicants in connection with approval of a development project for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the costs of public facilities related to the development project.

F. The Pittsburg city council finds that the creation of a regional transportation-development impact mitigation fee (RTDIM) program is necessary to ensure that new development pays its fair share of the construction costs of the regional transportation improvements identified in the ECCRFFA fee program report and any subsequently adopted fee program updates.

G. This chapter is statutorily exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) pursuant to Section 21080(b)(8) of the Public Resources Code and Section 15273(a)(4) of the CEQA Guidelines because the fees collected as a result of this action will be used for regional transportation infrastructure necessary to maintain an acceptable level of service within existing service areas. Once sufficient funds are collected and prior to approval of the final alignment and configuration of the individual transportation improvement projects, ECCRFFA or the city of Pittsburg will take all other CEQA required actions. The city council further finds that the adoption of the automatic change in the RTDIM fees annually in accordance with changes in the Engineering News-Record index is also statutorily exempt under Section 15273(a)(4) of the California Environmental Quality Act because the amount of any increase is precisely determinable based on the published change of the index and relates solely to the increase of construction costs for the previously identified projects. [Ord. 05-1247, 2005.]

15.102.020 Adoption of RTDIM fees and reports.
The city council shall, by resolution, set forth the specific amount of the RTDIM fees based on the ECCRFFA fee program report and any subsequently adopted ECCRFFA fee program updates. The city council may, by resolution, update the RTDIM fees as often as necessary. All such resolutions adopting or updating RTDIM fees shall contain the findings necessary under the Mitigation Fee Act. [Ord. 05-1247, 2005.]

15.102.030 Automatic fee increases.
RTDIM fees established by city council resolution shall, on January 1st of each year, be automatically increased or decreased from the amount then applicable by the same percentage as the percentage of increase or decrease in construction costs between September 1st of the calendar year immediately preceding September 1st of the current calendar year, based on the Engineering News-Record Construction Costs Index – San Francisco Bay Area, without further action by the city council. [Ord. 05-1247, 2005.]

15.102.040 Payment of fees.
A. The property owner shall pay to the city the RTDIM fee established by city council resolution. The fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit.

B. The applicable RTDIM fee shall be determined on the basis of the fee schedule in effect at the time of the building permit, or other applicable permit is issued. If no permit is required, then the fees are payable in the amounts in effect at the commencement of the project. The chief building official or other official designated by the city manager shall determine the amount of the fee in accordance with the standards set forth in the city council resolution.

C. No building permit shall be issued for property within the city unless the RTDIM fee for that property is paid as required by this chapter.

D. The RTDIM fees shall also be paid as a condition of an extension or renewal of a public permit issued after passage of this resolution if a fee has not been paid previously. [Ord. 05-1247, 2005.]

15.102.050 Fee exemptions.
The RTDIM fee shall not be imposed on a development project in the following instances:

A. Developments that are subject to and pay the RTDIM fee shall be exempt from payment of the city of Pittsburg regional transportation mitigation fee (RTMF) codified in Chapter 15.100 PMC, and most recently updated by Resolution No. 04-10199;

B. Developments that are not subject to payment of the RTDIM fee shall remain subject to payment of the city of Pittsburg regional transportation mitigation fee (RTMF) codified in Chapter 15.100 PMC, and most recently updated by Resolution No. 04-10199;

C. The fee shall not be required of any project involving replacement of existing structures destroyed by fire or other natural disaster, or the rehabilitation of existing structures where the total cost of the work undertaken is less than 50 percent of the value of the existing structure;

D. The following uses are categorically exempt from the fees imposed by this chapter: Christmas tree lots, seasonal fruit stands, mobile food vendors and circuses and carnivals;

E. Any alteration or addition to a residential structure, except to the extent that a residential unit is added to a single-family residential unit or another unit is added to an existing multifamily residential unit. [Ord. 05-1247, 2005.]

15.102.060 Creation of RTDIM fee account.
The revenues raised by payment of the RTDIM fee shall be placed in a separate account to permit accounting for such revenues until such time as the fees are remitted to ECCRFFA.

Fees paid pursuant to this resolution shall be remitted periodically to the East Contra Costa regional fee and financing authority to be placed in an account to be used solely for the purposes and projects as described in this section. Any interest accumulated on such funds shall also be used only for the purposes and projects.

A. To pay for acquisition/construction of the improvements identified in the ECCRFFA fee program report and any subsequently adopted fee program updates (“improvements”);

B. To pay for design, engineering, construction of and property acquisition for, and reasonable costs of outside consultant studies related to, the improvements;

F. To pay for and/or reimburse costs of the city of Pittsburg’s administration of the RTDIM fee program, including, but not limited to, the cost of studies, legal costs, and other costs of updating the fee. [Ord. 05-1247, 2005.]

15.102.070 Annual and five-year RTDIM program reviews.
A. Within 180 days after the close of each fiscal year, the city manager or his designee shall prepare a report for the city council, pursuant to Government Code Section 66006, identifying the balance of fees in the account at the beginning and end of the fiscal year, the fee, interest, and other income, and the amount of expenditure by public facility, any refunds and other expenditures.

B. The city shall make the periodic report available to the public, and the city council shall review the report at a regularly scheduled meeting in accordance with Section 66006.

C. The city shall similarly conduct the periodic review under Government Code Section 66001(d) every five years.

D. Pursuant to Government Code Section 66002, the city council shall also annually review, as a part of its capital improvement plan, the ECCRFFA regional traffic improvements to be financed with the RTDIM fees. The city council shall make findings identifying the purpose to which the existing fee balances are to be put and demonstrating a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it is charged. This annual review may warrant adjustments to the RTDIM fees. [Ord. 05-1247, 2005.]

15.102.080 Other authority.
This chapter is intended to establish a supplemental method for funding the cost of certain regional transportation improvements as identified in the ECCRFFA fee program report and any subsequently adopted ECCRFFA fee program updates. The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to limit the power of the city council to impose any other fee or exactions or to continue to impose existing ones on development within the city, but shall be in addition to any other requirements which the city council is authorized to impose or has previously imposed. In addition, individual property owners shall remain obligated to fund, construct and/or dedicate the improvements, public facilities and other exactions required by the city, including without limitation those required by the city standard details and specifications and other applicable public works standards. [Ord. 05-1247, 2005.]

15.102.090 Severability.
Each component of this chapter is severable. Should any portion of this chapter be held invalid and unenforceable by a body of competent jurisdiction, then the remaining portions shall continue to be in full force and effect. The city council of the city of Pittsburg declares that it would have adopted this chapter and each section, subsection, clause, sentence, phrase and other portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that one or more section, subsection, clause, sentence, phrase or other portion may be held invalid or unconstitutional.

15.103.010 Findings and purpose.
A. Projected new development in the city of Pittsburg will further congest the freeways and arterial roadways in the cities of Pittsburg, Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley and the unincorporated eastern portion of Contra Costa County (the “regional area”) and place additional demands on the regional transportation system.

B. The city of Pittsburg previously participated in the East Contra Costa Regional Fee and Financing Authority (“ECCRFFA”), a joint powers agency, for the funding and implementation of transportation improvement projects in the regional area.

C. The city of Pittsburg intends to establish its own comprehensive fee program to help fund regional transportation improvements which are necessary to offset the impacts of continuing growth and development within the city, and to cooperate with the city’s regional partners, including ECCRFFA, to fund and implement transportation projects in the regional area. Expansion and construction of the improvements identified in the 2010 East Contra Costa Regional Fee Program Update (“fee study”), on file and available for review at the city, will increase the flow of traffic, reduce congestion and noise, and improve safety and air quality throughout the regional area.

D. Pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act, California Government Code Section 66000 et seq., a local agency is authorized to charge a fee to development applicants in connection with approval of a development project for the purpose of offsetting all or a portion of the costs of public facilities related to the development project.

E. The Pittsburg city council finds that the creation of a Pittsburg regional transportation development impact mitigation fee (“PRTDIM”) program is necessary to ensure that new development pays its fair share of the construction costs of the regional transportation improvements identified in the 2010 East Contra Costa Regional Fee Program Update, and any subsequently adopted fee program updates.

F. This chapter is statutorily exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) pursuant to Section 21080(b)(8) of the Public Resources Code and Section 15273(a)(4) of the CEQA Guidelines because the fees collected as a result of this action will be used for regional transportation infrastructure necessary to maintain an acceptable level of service within existing service areas. Once sufficient funds are collected and prior to the approval of the final alignment and configuration of the individual transportation improvement projects, the city of Pittsburg or other lead agency, as appropriate, will take all other CEQA required actions. The city council further finds that the adoption of the automatic change in PRTDIM fees annually in accordance with changes in the Engineering News-Record Index is also statutorily exempt under Section 15273(a)(4) because the amount of any increase is precisely determinable based on the published change of the index and relates solely to the increase of construction costs for the previously identified projects. [Ord. 10-1329 § 2, 2010; Ord. 10-1328 § 2, 2010.]

15.103.020 Adoption of PRTDIM fees and reports.
The city council shall, by resolution, set forth the specific amount of the PRTDIM fees based on the 2010 East Contra Costa Regional Fee Program Update and any subsequent fee program updates adopted by the city council. The city council may, by resolution, update the PRTDIM fees as often as necessary. All such resolutions adopting or updating PRTDIM fees shall contain the findings necessary under the Mitigation Fee Act. [Ord. 10-1329 § 2, 2010; Ord. 10-1328 § 2, 2010.]

15.103.030 Automatic fee increases.
PRTDIM fees established by city council resolution shall, on January 1st of each year, be automatically increased or decreased from the amount then applicable by the same percentage as the percentage of increase or decrease in construction costs between September 1st of the calendar year immediately preceding September 1st of the current calendar year, based on the Engineering News-Record Construction Costs Index – San Francisco Bay Area, without further action by the city council. [Ord. 10-1329 § 2, 2010; Ord. 10-1328 § 2, 2010.]

15.103.040 Payment of fees.
A. The property owner shall pay to the city the PRTDIM fee established by city council resolution. The fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit, or at such earlier time as agreed to in writing between the property owner and the city and as consistent with applicable law, or at a time set forth under a fee deferral program established by resolution, but certainly no later than the time of final inspection.

B. The applicable PRTDIM fee shall be determined on the basis of the fee schedule in effect at the time of building permit issuance, or at such earlier time as agreed to in writing between the property owner and the city. If no permit is required, then the fees are payable in the amounts in effect at the commencement of the project. The chief building official or other official designated by the city manager shall determine the amount of the fee in accordance with the standards set forth in the city council resolution.

C. No building permit shall be issued for property within the city unless the PRTDIM fee for that property is paid or otherwise satisfied as required by this chapter unless deferred to a time set forth under a fee deferral program established by resolution but certainly no later than the time of final inspection.

D. The PRTDIM fees shall also be paid as a condition of an extension or renewal of a public permit issued prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter if a city regional traffic mitigation fee has not been paid previously. [Ord. 10-1331 § 2, 2011; Ord. 10-1329 § 2, 2010; Ord. 10-1328 § 2, 2010.]

15.103.050 Fee exemptions.
A. Developments that are subject to the PRTDIM fee established by this chapter shall be exempt from payment of the city of Pittsburg regional transportation mitigation fee (RTMF) codified in Chapter 15.100 PMC and the regional transportation development impact mitigation fee (RTDIM) codified in Chapter 15.102 PMC.

B. Developments that are not subject to the PRTDIM fee established by this chapter shall remain subject to payment of the city of Pittsburg regional transportation development impact mitigation fee (RTDIM) codified in Chapter 15.102 PMC.

D. The PRTDIM fee shall not be required of any project involving the rehabilitation of existing structures where the total cost of the work undertaken is less than 50 percent of the value of the existing structure. The property owner has the burden to document, to the chief building official’s satisfaction, that a rehabilitation project on the property qualifies for this exemption.

E. The following uses are categorically exempt from the fees imposed by this chapter: Christmas tree lots, seasonal fruit stands, mobile food vendors and circuses and carnivals.

F. The PTRDIM fee shall not be required of any alteration or addition to a residential structure, except to the extent that a residential unit is added to a single-family residential unit or another unit is added to an existing multifamily residential unit.

15.104.010 Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the listed terms shall be defined as follows:

A. “Impervious surface” means any hard surface area which either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil mantle as it entered under natural conditions pre-existent to development, and/or a hard surface area which causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from the flow present under natural conditions existing prior to development.

B. “Permanent on-site detention facility” means to construct on said property to be developed a facility that is intended to remain in service permanently on the development site.

C. “Temporary on-site” means to construct a “temporary” short-term measure that will later be removed or changed.

D. “City official” means the director of community development or a staff person designated by the director to perform the duties set forth in the ordinance codified in this chapter.

E. “Kirker Creek watershed” is that area in the city of Pittsburg as defined on the map attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and as expanded to include the additional property shown on Map A-1 attached to the amending ordinance. [Ord. 03-1205 § 4, 2003; Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.020 Kirker Creek watershed stormwater management plan.
The Kirker Creek watershed drainage improvement plan and schedule adopted by the city council by Resolution 99-8789 on January 19, 1999, is the stormwater management plan for the Kirker Creek watershed drainage area. [Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.030 Findings.
The council finds and determines that said drainage area has inadequate drainage facilities; that future subdivision and development of property within said drainage area will have a significant adverse impact on existing and future development; that development of property within the drainage area, with its resultant increase in impervious surfaces, will require the construction of facilities described in the stormwater management plan; that the fees herein provided to be charged are uniformly applied per acre for commercial and industrial, or per unit for residential and multifamily residential, of impervious surface basis and fairly apportioned within said drainage area on the basis of benefits conferred on property upon which additional impervious surfaces in said drainage area are constructed; that the estimated total of all fees collectible hereunder does not exceed the estimated total costs of all drainage facilities shown on the stormwater management plan; and that the drainage facilities planned are in addition to existing drainage facilities already serving the drainage area at the time of the adoption of the stormwater management plan. [Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.040 Exemptions.
A. The fee shall not be required for the following: (1) to replace a structure destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, winds or other acts of God, provided the resultant structure has the same, or less imperious surface as the original structure; (2) to modify structures or other impervious surfaces, provided the amount of ground coverage is not increased by more than 100 square feet; or (3) to convey land to a government agency, public entity, public utility, or abutting property owner where a new building lot or site is not created as a result of the conveyance.

B. Except for that parcel identified in Map A-1 attached to the amending ordinance, the development of which is subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (C) of this section, the fee provided for herein shall not apply to other properties north of the Pittsburg/Antioch Highway because the city finds that such properties are downstream of Kirker Creek and do not contribute flow to Kirker Creek. Such downstream property owners, however, will be required to mitigate their stormwater flow in accordance with other applicable laws and city requirements.

C. As a condition precedent to the discharge of any stormwater into Kirker Creek from the property identified in Map A-1 (the added property), attached to the amending ordinance, and as conditions to the development in addition to those set forth in PMC 15.104.050, the following requirements and conditions must be met:

1. No storm water from the added property will be discharged into Kirker Creek that will cause the flow of the creek to exceed its maximum design capacity.

2. The added property shall be designed with retention basins capable of storing storm runoff when the condition set forth in subsection (A) of this section prevents pumping into the creek.

3. Design and construction of the retention basins and any pump facilities to be installed on the added property shall meet all city of Pittsburg requirements.

4. The operation and maintenance of all storm drain facilities on the added property shall be the responsibility of the property owner, unless the city, in its sole discretion, agrees to accept any dedication of such basin(s) or pump facilities.

5. The added property shall be subject to all charges and fees established herein for all properties subject to the ordinance.

6. All storm water discharging into Kirker Creek from the added property will be subject to meeting the requirements of applicable environmental agencies. [Ord. 03-1205 §§ 5, 6, 2003; Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.050 Conditions of development.
The city council finds that existing facilities are inadequate and that the creation of new impervious surface area in the Kirker Creek watershed prior to the completion of downstream improvements will create a substantial risk of flooding. Accordingly, the following conditions will apply to new development within the Kirker Creek watershed prior to completion of all recommended improvements to the drainage area downstream of the proposed development:

A. A property owner may construct permanent on-site detention facilities to contain any increase in runoff between pre- and post-development conditions. Pre-development conditions are at the time of application; post-development conditions are after construction of the development has begun. Sizing of detention facilities will be in accordance with the stormwater management plan criteria. If permanent on-site detention facilities are constructed, no fee is required under the ordinance codified in this chapter.

B. A property owner may construct temporary on-site or off-site detention measures that must remain in place until downstream improvements required by the stormwater management plan are completed. Temporary measures could include, but are not limited to: (1) allowing temporary ponding in parking lots or other impervious areas; (2) enclosing roofs with parapets to contain water; or (3) conveying the runoff to a temporary cistern/tank. Sizing for temporary detention measures will be according to the stormwater management plan criteria. The city official must review and approve temporary measures proposed for the development. When the downstream improvements required by the stormwater management plan are completed, then the temporary detention measures can be eliminated. Where temporary drainage measures are utilized, a property owner will be required to pay drainage fees in accordance with the fee schedule.

C. Unless a property owner utilizes either permanent on-site detention facilities or temporary detention measures as described above, approval of the proposed development will be delayed until the downstream improvements required by the stormwater management plan are completed. The drainage fees are payable when development occurs.

D. Single lots under 6,000 square feet are exempt from physical mitigation. However, payment of the drainage fee is still required.

E. All new development, whether subject to the drainage fee or not, is responsible for construction of all drainage facilities needed to connect the development site to the city’s existing storm drain system. [Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.060 Building permits.
Except as expressly permitted by the ordinance codified in this chapter, the city official shall not issue any building permit for construction within the drainage area until the required drainage fee has been paid. For initial construction, the fee shall be based upon calculations provided by the developer of the increase in impermeable areas of all improvements, including street improvements, sidewalks, building roofs, parking lots, etc. For single-family residential swimming pools on lots for which the drainage fee has not been paid, the fees shall be calculated for the pool area and increased impervious area such as the concrete decking and walkways built around the pool. For other construction, modifications or replacements to an existing facility that cause an increase in impervious surface, including but not limited to driveways, walks, patios, etc., the amount of net increase in impervious surface shall be subject to a fee paid prior to the issuance of a permit. All fees charged shall be at the rate listed in the fee schedule. [Ord. 05-1236 § 4, 2005; Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.070 Subdivisions.
Except as expressly permitted by the ordinance codified in this chapter, the property owner shall pay the drainage fee for the increase in impermeable surfaces on the frontage improvements for the proposed subdivision for which a final or parcel map is filed prior to recordation of such map. Drainage fees for each home within the subdivision shall be paid prior to issuance of the building permit for all impermeable surfaces created by the home and related on-site improvements. All fees charged shall be at the rate listed in the fee schedule. [Ord. 05-1236 § 5, 2005; Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.080 Fee schedule.
All fees charged under this section will be calculated at the rate of $0.68 per square foot for the increased impervious area. The fee charged under this section is based upon a uniform fee per square foot of impervious surface area created by development because the increased impervious surface results in increased stormwater runoff. The fees to be charged under this section shall be calculated from plans and measurements of the actual proposed increased impervious area, i.e., roof areas, sidewalks, and frontage improvements that cause increased runoff. [Ord. 05-1236 § 6, 2005; Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.090 Fee payment.
All fees collected hereunder shall be paid into the city and deposited to the account of the drainage facilities fund established by the finance department for the drainage area. Moneys in said fund shall be expended solely for land acquisition, construction, engineering, administration, repair, maintenance and operation or reimbursement for the same, in whole or in part, of planned drainage facilities within the drainage area or to reduce the principal or interest of any bonded indebtedness of the drainage area. [Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.100 Review of fees.
Project estimates shall be reviewed every year or sooner as deemed necessary that the ordinance codified in this chapter is in effect. The fee schedule shall be adjusted annually on January 1st to account for inflation using the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index. Such adjustment shall not require further notice or public hearing. [Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.010 Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the listed terms shall be defined as follows:

A. “Impervious surface” means any hard surface area which either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil mantle as it entered under natural conditions pre-existent to development, and/or a hard surface area which causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from the flow present under natural conditions existing prior to development.

B. “Permanent on-site detention facility” means to construct on said property to be developed a facility that is intended to remain in service permanently on the development site.

C. “Temporary on-site” means to construct a “temporary” short-term measure that will later be removed or changed.

D. “City official” means the director of community development or a staff person designated by the director to perform the duties set forth in the ordinance codified in this chapter.

E. “Kirker Creek watershed” is that area in the city of Pittsburg as defined on the map attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and as expanded to include the additional property shown on Map A-1 attached to the amending ordinance. [Ord. 03-1205 § 4, 2003; Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.020 Kirker Creek watershed stormwater management plan.
The Kirker Creek watershed drainage improvement plan and schedule adopted by the city council by Resolution 99-8789 on January 19, 1999, is the stormwater management plan for the Kirker Creek watershed drainage area. [Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.030 Findings.
The council finds and determines that said drainage area has inadequate drainage facilities; that future subdivision and development of property within said drainage area will have a significant adverse impact on existing and future development; that development of property within the drainage area, with its resultant increase in impervious surfaces, will require the construction of facilities described in the stormwater management plan; that the fees herein provided to be charged are uniformly applied per acre for commercial and industrial, or per unit for residential and multifamily residential, of impervious surface basis and fairly apportioned within said drainage area on the basis of benefits conferred on property upon which additional impervious surfaces in said drainage area are constructed; that the estimated total of all fees collectible hereunder does not exceed the estimated total costs of all drainage facilities shown on the stormwater management plan; and that the drainage facilities planned are in addition to existing drainage facilities already serving the drainage area at the time of the adoption of the stormwater management plan. [Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.040 Exemptions.
A. The fee shall not be required for the following: (1) to replace a structure destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, winds or other acts of God, provided the resultant structure has the same, or less imperious surface as the original structure; (2) to modify structures or other impervious surfaces, provided the amount of ground coverage is not increased by more than 100 square feet; or (3) to convey land to a government agency, public entity, public utility, or abutting property owner where a new building lot or site is not created as a result of the conveyance.

B. Except for that parcel identified in Map A-1 attached to the amending ordinance, the development of which is subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (C) of this section, the fee provided for herein shall not apply to other properties north of the Pittsburg/Antioch Highway because the city finds that such properties are downstream of Kirker Creek and do not contribute flow to Kirker Creek. Such downstream property owners, however, will be required to mitigate their stormwater flow in accordance with other applicable laws and city requirements.

C. As a condition precedent to the discharge of any stormwater into Kirker Creek from the property identified in Map A-1 (the added property), attached to the amending ordinance, and as conditions to the development in addition to those set forth in PMC 15.104.050, the following requirements and conditions must be met:

1. No storm water from the added property will be discharged into Kirker Creek that will cause the flow of the creek to exceed its maximum design capacity.

2. The added property shall be designed with retention basins capable of storing storm runoff when the condition set forth in subsection (A) of this section prevents pumping into the creek.

3. Design and construction of the retention basins and any pump facilities to be installed on the added property shall meet all city of Pittsburg requirements.

4. The operation and maintenance of all storm drain facilities on the added property shall be the responsibility of the property owner, unless the city, in its sole discretion, agrees to accept any dedication of such basin(s) or pump facilities.

5. The added property shall be subject to all charges and fees established herein for all properties subject to the ordinance.

6. All storm water discharging into Kirker Creek from the added property will be subject to meeting the requirements of applicable environmental agencies. [Ord. 03-1205 §§ 5, 6, 2003; Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.050 Conditions of development.
The city council finds that existing facilities are inadequate and that the creation of new impervious surface area in the Kirker Creek watershed prior to the completion of downstream improvements will create a substantial risk of flooding. Accordingly, the following conditions will apply to new development within the Kirker Creek watershed prior to completion of all recommended improvements to the drainage area downstream of the proposed development:

A. A property owner may construct permanent on-site detention facilities to contain any increase in runoff between pre- and post-development conditions. Pre-development conditions are at the time of application; post-development conditions are after construction of the development has begun. Sizing of detention facilities will be in accordance with the stormwater management plan criteria. If permanent on-site detention facilities are constructed, no fee is required under the ordinance codified in this chapter.

B. A property owner may construct temporary on-site or off-site detention measures that must remain in place until downstream improvements required by the stormwater management plan are completed. Temporary measures could include, but are not limited to: (1) allowing temporary ponding in parking lots or other impervious areas; (2) enclosing roofs with parapets to contain water; or (3) conveying the runoff to a temporary cistern/tank. Sizing for temporary detention measures will be according to the stormwater management plan criteria. The city official must review and approve temporary measures proposed for the development. When the downstream improvements required by the stormwater management plan are completed, then the temporary detention measures can be eliminated. Where temporary drainage measures are utilized, a property owner will be required to pay drainage fees in accordance with the fee schedule.

C. Unless a property owner utilizes either permanent on-site detention facilities or temporary detention measures as described above, approval of the proposed development will be delayed until the downstream improvements required by the stormwater management plan are completed. The drainage fees are payable when development occurs.

D. Single lots under 6,000 square feet are exempt from physical mitigation. However, payment of the drainage fee is still required.

E. All new development, whether subject to the drainage fee or not, is responsible for construction of all drainage facilities needed to connect the development site to the city’s existing storm drain system. [Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.060 Building permits.
Except as expressly permitted by the ordinance codified in this chapter, the city official shall not issue any building permit for construction within the drainage area until the required drainage fee has been paid. For initial construction, the fee shall be based upon calculations provided by the developer of the increase in impermeable areas of all improvements, including street improvements, sidewalks, building roofs, parking lots, etc. For single-family residential swimming pools on lots for which the drainage fee has not been paid, the fees shall be calculated for the pool area and increased impervious area such as the concrete decking and walkways built around the pool. For other construction, modifications or replacements to an existing facility that cause an increase in impervious surface, including but not limited to driveways, walks, patios, etc., the amount of net increase in impervious surface shall be subject to a fee paid prior to the issuance of a permit. All fees charged shall be at the rate listed in the fee schedule. [Ord. 05-1236 § 4, 2005; Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.070 Subdivisions.
Except as expressly permitted by the ordinance codified in this chapter, the property owner shall pay the drainage fee for the increase in impermeable surfaces on the frontage improvements for the proposed subdivision for which a final or parcel map is filed prior to recordation of such map. Drainage fees for each home within the subdivision shall be paid prior to issuance of the building permit for all impermeable surfaces created by the home and related on-site improvements. All fees charged shall be at the rate listed in the fee schedule. [Ord. 05-1236 § 5, 2005; Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.080 Fee schedule.
All fees charged under this section will be calculated at the rate of $0.68 per square foot for the increased impervious area. The fee charged under this section is based upon a uniform fee per square foot of impervious surface area created by development because the increased impervious surface results in increased stormwater runoff. The fees to be charged under this section shall be calculated from plans and measurements of the actual proposed increased impervious area, i.e., roof areas, sidewalks, and frontage improvements that cause increased runoff. [Ord. 05-1236 § 6, 2005; Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.090 Fee payment.
All fees collected hereunder shall be paid into the city and deposited to the account of the drainage facilities fund established by the finance department for the drainage area. Moneys in said fund shall be expended solely for land acquisition, construction, engineering, administration, repair, maintenance and operation or reimbursement for the same, in whole or in part, of planned drainage facilities within the drainage area or to reduce the principal or interest of any bonded indebtedness of the drainage area. [Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.104.100 Review of fees.
Project estimates shall be reviewed every year or sooner as deemed necessary that the ordinance codified in this chapter is in effect. The fee schedule shall be adjusted annually on January 1st to account for inflation using the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index. Such adjustment shall not require further notice or public hearing. [Ord. 1180 § 3, 2001.]

15.108.070 HCP/NCCP fee.
HCP/NCCP implementation fees are hereby adopted to fund the public facilities identified in the HCP/NCCP.

A. Development Fee.

1. The city planner, or his/her designee, shall determine in which of the three development fee zones the affected development project is located, pursuant to Exhibit A and the map data used to create Exhibit A attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter.

2. The development fee for each development project shall be calculated by multiplying the fee for the applicable development fee zone by the acreage of land permanently disturbed by the project, as determined by the city planner, pursuant to Chapter 9.3.1 of the HCP/NCCP. The development fee amount shall be based on the fee in place at the time of actual payment of HCP/NCCP development fee to the city. This fee amount shall be based on the development fee amount to be established by the city council by adoption of a fee resolution.

3. Except as otherwise provided in PMC 15.108.080(A) and (C), upon or before the issuance of a grading permit or, if no grading permit is issued, then upon or before issuance of the first building permit for the project, the project applicant shall either (1) pay the entire development fee or, (2) with the prior written approval of the city council, pay at least 67 percent of the development fee and execute an agreement with the city, in a form approved by the city attorney, to provide additional funding payments through assessments on the subject parcels or other mechanisms; provided, that assessments or other funding mechanisms are legally authorized for this purpose, pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 9.3.1 of the HCP/NCCP.

4. The development fee amount applicable to the affected development project shall be the development fee amount in effect at the time a grading permit is issued, or if no grading permit is issued, at the time the first building permit is issued for the project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a project applicant may submit a written request to pay the development fee prior to the issuance of a grading permit or first building permit. Such request shall be forwarded by the city planner to the implementing entity in order that the implementing entity can make a determination pursuant to Section 13.2.2.1 of the implementing agreement and Chapter 9.3.1 of the HCP/NCCP. If such request is granted by the implementing entity, the applicable development fee shall be the development fee in effect at the time the payment is thereafter made.

B. Wetland Mitigation Fee.

1. Except as otherwise provided in PMC 15.108.080(B) and (C), for any development project that will fill, dredge, or remove jurisdictional wetlands and waters, riparian woodland or scrub, or stream buffers, the applicant shall pay a wetland mitigation fee in addition to the development fee.

2. Wetland Mitigation Fees Vary by Wetland Type. The city planner shall determine on the basis of the verified wetlands delineation report completed pursuant the Chapter 6.2.1 of the HCP/NCCP which of the wetland types will be affected by the development project and shall determine the area affected by the development project and the total amount of the wetland mitigation fee required for the development project according to Chapter 9.3.1 of the HCP/NCCP. The wetland mitigation fee applicable to an affected development project that has been granted an exception to the stream setback shall be determined by the city planner, or his/her designee, based on the acreage of setback encroachment, in accordance with Chapter 9.3.1 of the HCP/NCCP. This fee amount shall be based on the wetland mitigation fee amount to be established by city council by adoption of a fee resolution.

3. Upon or before the issuance of a grading permit or, if no grading permit is issued, upon or before issuance of the first building permit for the project, the project applicant shall pay the wetland mitigation fee determined for the affected development project. The wetland mitigation fee amount shall be based on the fee in place at the time of actual payment of HCP/NCCP wetland mitigation fee to the city.

4. The wetland mitigation fee amount applicable to an affected development project shall be the wetland mitigation fee amount in effect at the time a grading permit is issued or, if no grading permit is issued, at the time the first building permit is issued for the project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a project applicant may submit a written request to pay the wetland mitigation fee prior to issuance of a grading or first building permit. Such request shall be forwarded by the city planner to the implementing entity in order that the implementing entity can make a determination pursuant to Section 13.2.2.1 of the implementing agreement and Chapter 9.3.1 of the HCP/NCCP. If such request is granted, the applicable wetland mitigation fee shall be the wetland mitigation fee in effect at the time the payment is thereafter made.

C. Administration Fee. Each HCP/NCCP applicant shall be charged a one-time fee for each respective HCP/NCCP application request to cover costs associated with the review of each application. Payment of this fee shall be required at the time of HCP/NCCP application submittal.

1. All fees collected hereunder, except for the administration fee, shall be transmitted to the city finance department and deposited into a noninterest-bearing pass-through account and dispersed to the HCP/NCCP Conservancy at the end of each month and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the Mitigation Fee Act.

2. Timing of mitigation fee payment not otherwise specified by this chapter shall be governed by the HCP/NCCP. Pages 9-31 and 9-32 of the HCP/NCCP provide additional guidance on timing of mitigation fee payments and are incorporated herein by reference.

D. Determination of Fee. The development fee, wetland fee, HCP/NCCP administration fee amount, and method for calculation shall be adopted by city council fee resolution. The fee calculation methodology established by resolution may be used to automatically update fees as required by the HCP/NCCP. [Ord. 07-1293 § 3, 2007.]

15.108.080 HCP/NCCP land and other options in lieu of fee.
A. Dedications.

1. Upon receiving a voluntary offer to dedicate land in lieu of some or all of the development fee that would otherwise be imposed upon a development project, the city planner will forward such offer to the implementing entity, in order that the implementing entity can make a determination whether to accept such offer in accordance with Section 13.2.2.2 of the implementing agreement and Chapters 8.6.7 and 9.3.1 of the HCP/NCCP.

2. If the implementing entity concludes that land in lieu of mitigation fees is required to comply with the stay ahead provision set forth at Chapter 8.6.1 of the HCP/NCCP and Section 9.2 of the implementing agreement and recommends that the city require land in lieu of mitigation fees, the city council may require that some or all affected development projects offer a dedication of qualifying land in lieu of some or all of the development fee that would otherwise be imposed.

B. Creation/Restoration of Habitat. Upon receiving a voluntary offer to perform wetland mitigation in lieu of paying some or all of the wetland mitigation fee, the city planner will forward such offer to the implementing entity in order that the implementing entity can make a determination whether to accept such offer in accordance with Conservation Measures 2.1 and 2.2 and Chapter 9.3.1 of the HCP/NCCP.

C. Separate Take Authorization. On a case-by-case basis, a project applicant that possesses separate and final approval from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and/or California Department of Fish and Game for incidental take of all federally or state listed species that may be adversely affected by the development project may apply to the city to pay a fee, the amount to be negotiated by the project applicant with the city manager, to support the conservation of habitat and open space under the HCP/NCCP in lieu of the HCP/NCCP implementation fees. If the city planner determines that the mitigation and conservation requirements under the separate approval are equivalent to or exceed what would be required under this chapter, the city planner may determine that no further fees are required for purposes of complying with the HCP/NCCP, in which case the HCP/NCCP implementation fees described herein shall not be required of the project. [Ord. 07-1293 § 3, 2007.]

15.108.090 Take authorization application review procedures.

15.110.010 Purpose and scope.
In order to implement the goals of the city’s general plan, including the improvements contained in the capital improvement program, and to mitigate the impacts caused by new development in the city, a development impact fee and credit program has been established in the city. The city council has determined that a transfer credit is needed to encourage the removal of dilapidated, blighted and/or unsafe structures and to encourage the development of newer structures which comply with current fire, building and other applicable life safety codes in the city. The use of transfer credit promotes orderly city development and adequate city infrastructure relating to public services and facilities concerning water, sewer, roads and parks and is necessary to promote the health, safety and welfare of the people.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve a property owner or developer of the duty to comply with other applicable laws related to the construction and demolition of structures in the city, including the provisions of this title and the city building code. [Ord. 09-1314 § 2, 2009.]

[Ord. 09-1314 § 2, 2009.]

15.110.050 Transfer credit application.
A. An applicant for transfer credit shall submit a written request to the city at least 30 calendar days prior to demolition or removal of the structure on the subject property. The written request must establish to the city’s satisfaction that the subject property is eligible for transfer credit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The written request shall include at a minimum a description, including both the address and assessor parcel number, of the subject property, evidence related to prior legal uses of the subject property, the proposed date of demolition or removal, and other information or documentation required by the city engineer.

B. In the event an emergency incident beyond an applicant’s control prohibits the applicant from complying with the 30-day request period and prior notification requirements identified in subsection (A) of this section, the applicant may submit a written request to the city within 30 calendar days of the emergency incident seeking transfer credit for the structure on the subject property. In addition to the applicable requirements identified in subsection (A) of this section, a transfer credit application submitted pursuant to this subsection shall include evidence satisfactory to the city engineer that an emergency incident beyond the applicant’s control now necessitates the demolition on the subject property.

C. No transfer credit is available to an applicant under this chapter unless a written request is submitted as required by this section and approved in writing by the city engineer. [Ord. 09-1314 § 2, 2009.]

The transfer credit agreement shall be in a form satisfactory to the city engineer.

B. A transfer credit agreement is required for any transfer credit from the subject property to a recipient property. In the event the city issues a transfer credit, the transfer credit agreement shall identify the recipient property, the proposed use of the recipient property, the development plans for the recipient property, and other information as required by the city engineer. The applicant must also present evidence satisfactory to the city that the proposed use of transfer credit is consistent with applicable laws, including the Pittsburg Municipal Code and the nexus requirements of the Mitigation Fee Act. [Ord. 09-1314 § 2, 2009.]

15.110.070 Transfer credit.
A. Transfer credit may be transferred from the subject property to a recipient property subject to city approval and the execution of a transfer credit agreement pursuant to PMC 15.110.060.

B. If the city approves a transfer credit, the applicant shall record a document on the subject property, subject to the city’s sole satisfaction, identifying the specific transfer credit removed from the subject property and providing notice to subsequent purchasers that any new development on the subject property will require the full payment of any applicable development impact fees. The transfer credit shall not be valid until the city receives a copy of the recorded document.

C. If the city approves a transfer credit, any future development on the subject property shall be subject to the full payment of all applicable development impact fees related to the proposed development. [Ord. 09-1314 § 2, 2009.]

15.110.080 Transfer credit limitations.
A. Transfer credit provided pursuant to this chapter is valid for a period of 10 years from the city’s issuance of the transfer credit. For purposes of this section, transfer credit is deemed to be issued on the day the city receives the recorded document, referenced in PMC 15.110.070(B), or the city accepts an executed transfer credit agreement, referenced in PMC 15.110.060, whichever occurs later. Transfer credit may only be used by an applicant in conjunction with the payment of all other applicable development impact fees for an approved and permitted development project.

B. No transfer credit shall be given for a structure or use established prior to the annexation of the subject property to the city.

C. Transfer credit has no cash value and the applicant is not entitled to reimbursement in the event that the applicant’s transfer credit exceeds the amount of development impact fees due on any proposed new development or expire. Each applicable development impact fee and corresponding transfer credit shall be calculated separately.

D. Transfer credit may only be used for a recipient property which is required to pay the same type of fees as the subject property.

E. Once development impact fees have been paid in conjunction with the issuance of a building permit or other approval for a replacement structure on the subject property or new development on a recipient property, the city shall not consider a request for the application of transfer credit or refund those development impact fees paid.

F. No transfer credit is valid unless approved in writing by the city engineer.

G. Transfer credit is valid for the applicant only and may not be assigned, sold or otherwise transferred to any third party. Any attempt by the applicant to assign, sell or otherwise transfer such transfer credit authorized by this chapter shall be void and unenforceable. [Ord. 09-1314 § 2, 2009.]

15.110.090 Administration fee.

Unless being considered as part of a consolidated application with other approvals that are subject to the final approval of the city council, the planning commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the tentative map, and the department shall report its decision to the subdivider within 50 days after the tentative map was accepted for filing. If an environmental impact report is prepared, the decision shall be made within 45 days after certification of the environmental impact report. (Government Code Sections 66452.1, 66452.3, 65952.1.)

If no action is taken within these time limits or an extension mutually approved under PMC 17.16.090, the tentative map is deemed approved insofar as it complies with the general plan, an applicable specific plan, this title, including city approved policies, standards and requirements, the city zoning ordinance, and the Subdivision Map Act. (Government Code Section 66452.4.)

C. Approval. The planning commission may approve or conditionally approve a tentative map, or recommend such actions to the city council, if it finds that: (Government Code Sections 66473.5, 66474, 66474.5.)

1. The proposed map is consistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan, or other applicable provisions of this code;

2. The site is physically suitable for the type of development;

3. The site is physically suitable for the proposed density of development;

4. The design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements will not cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat (notwithstanding the foregoing, the planning commission may approve such a tentative map if an environmental impact report was prepared with respect to the project and a finding was made that specific economic, social, or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the environmental impact report);

5. The design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will not cause serious public health problems; and

6. a. The design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will not conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision. (The planning commission may approve a map if it finds that alternative easements, for access or for use, will be provided, and that these will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and no authority is hereby granted to the planning commission to determine that the public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision.)

b. The planning commission may modify or delete a condition of approval recommended in the department’s report, except a condition required by this code or the city engineer related to public health and safety or by the city approved policies and standards. The planning commission may add additional requirements as a condition of its approval.

c. The planning commission may require that the subdivider defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the city, its agents, officers, and employees from any claim, action, or proceedings against the city to attack the approval of a subdivision under Government Code Section 66474.9.

D. Denial. The planning commission may deny approval of the tentative map, or recommend such action by the city council, on any of the grounds provided by the Subdivision Map Act or this code. The planning commission shall deny approval of the tentative map if it makes any of the following findings:

1. The proposed map is inconsistent with the general plan or any applicable specific plan, or other applicable provisions of this code;

2. The site is not physically suitable for the type of development;

3. The site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of development;

4. The design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements is likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat;

5. The design of the subdivision or the type of improvements is likely to cause serious public health problems;

6. The design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision; or

7. Subject to Section 66474.4 of the Subdivision Map Act, that the land is subject to a contract entered into pursuant to the California Land Conservation Act of 1965 and that the resulting parcels following a subdivision of the land would be too small to sustain their agricultural use. (Government Code Sections 66473, 66474, 66474.01, 66474.4, 66474.6.)

E. Standards in Effect. In determining whether to approve or disapprove a tentative map application, the city shall apply only those ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the application was accepted as complete. The city may apply ordinances, policies, and standards adopted later if:

1. The subdivider applicant requests changes in connection with the same development project and they are approved; or

17.20.065 Planning commission action on consolidated applications.
A. If applications for a tentative map and one or more other discretionary approvals are consolidated, and the approvals other than the tentative map require the final approval of the city council, the planning commission shall recommend approval, conditional approval, or denial of the tentative map as submitted or in modified form.

B. If the planning commission recommends approval, conditional approval, or denial of a tentative map, the city council shall fix the meeting date at which the tentative map will be considered by it, which date shall be within 30 days thereafter. After a public hearing, the city council shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the tentative map within that 30-day period and make findings not inconsistent with this chapter. If an environmental impact report is prepared, the decision shall be made within 45 days after certification of the environmental impact report. (Government Code Sections 66452.1, 66452.3, 65952.1.) The city council has the same authority to impose, modify, or delete conditions as the planning commission under this chapter. [Ord. 15-1396 § 8, 2015.]

17.20.070 Expiration of tentative map.
A. Expiration. The approval or conditional approval of a tentative map expires 36 months after its approval. The expiration of the map terminates all proceedings and no final or parcel map may be filed without first processing a new tentative map. (Government Code Sections 66452.6(a) and (d), 66463.5.)

An approved amendment shall not automatically alter the expiration date of the tentative map. [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

17.20.090 Vesting tentative maps.
A. General. Whenever a tentative map is required, a vesting tentative map may be filed instead. The words “vesting tentative map” must be printed conspicuously on the face of the map. (Government Code Sections 66452, 66498 through 66498.9.)

B. Procedures and Requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the procedures and requirements for a tentative map and subdivisions generally apply to a vesting tentative map. The subdivider shall submit additional information at the time of filing the tentative map as set forth in PMC 17.20.030(M).

C. Development Rights.

1. Development Rights Created. The approval of a vesting tentative map confers a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the city’s ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the date the city determines the application is complete. If, before the application is complete, the city had formally initiated proceedings to amend an ordinance, policy, or standard, the city may apply the ordinance, policy or standard in its amended form if the amendment is in effect on the date the city approved the tentative map. (Government Code Section 66498.1(a).)

2. Duration of Development Rights. The right to proceed with development as set forth in subsection (C)(1) of this section continues for one year following the recordation of the final map or parcel map. If a project covered by a single vesting tentative map is divided into phases and more than one final map is recorded, the one-year period begins for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. (Government Code Section 66452.6(g).)

3. Expiration of Development Rights.

a. The right to proceed with development as set forth in subsection (C)(1) of this section expires if a final map is not approved before the vesting tentative map expires under PMC 17.20.070. (Government Code Section 66452.6(g).)

b. If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the one-year period specified in subsection (C)(2) of this section, the right to proceed with development continues until the building permit expires. (Government Code Section 66452.6(h).)

c. If a final map is recorded based upon a vesting tentative map and the development rights expire, the final map remains in effect without the development rights.

4. Extension of Time for Exercise of Development Rights.

a. If the city does not process an application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review within 30 days of the date the application is complete, the one-year period specified in (C)(2) of this section is automatically extended by the time exceeding the 30-day period used by the city to complete processing. (Government Code Section 66452.6(g).)

b. Before the expiration of the one year specified in subsection (C)(2) of this section, a subdivider may apply to the planning commission for a one-year extension. (Government Code Section 66452.6(g).)

D. City’s Right to Condition or Deny Approval.

1. This chapter does not:

a. Enlarge or diminish the types of conditions which the city may impose on a development; or

b. Diminish or alter the city’s power to protect against a condition dangerous to the public health or safety. (Government Code Section 66498.6.)

2. The city may condition or deny a permit, approval, extension, or entitlement relating to a vesting tentative map if it determines that either:

a. The failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the community in a condition dangerous to their health or safety; or

b. The condition of denial is required to comply with state or federal law. (Government Code Section 66498.1(c).) [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

C. Storm Drainage. Stormwater runoff from the subdivision shall be collected and conveyed by an approved storm drain system. The storm drain system shall be designed for ultimate development of the watershed. The storm drain system shall provide for the protection of abutting and off-site properties that would be adversely affected by any increase in runoff attributed to the development. Off-site storm drain improvements may be required to satisfy this requirement. (Government Code Section 66411.)

D. Sanitary Sewers. Each unit or lot within the subdivision shall be served by an approved sanitary sewer system with a minimum eight-inch diameter main line.

3. The agreement shall be recorded with the county recorder at the expense of the owner and shall constitute notice to all successors and assigns of title to the real property of the obligations set forth therein, and shall also constitute a lien in such amount necessary to fully reimburse the city, including interest as provided above, subject to foreclosure in the event of a default in payment. The obligations under the agreement shall run with the property and constitute a lien against it.

4. In the event of litigation occasioned by default of the owner, the owner agrees to pay all costs involved, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. Those costs shall become a part of the lien against the real property.

The construction of deferred improvements shall conform to this title and all applicable provisions of this code in effect at the time of construction.

B. Remainders. For a designated remainder parcel, the fulfillment of construction requirements for improvements is not required until the city is ready to issue a permit or other grant of approval for development of the remainder parcel or until the construction of the improvements is required under an agreement between the subdivider and the city. In the absence of an agreement, the city may require fulfillment of the construction requirements within a reasonable time following approval of the final map and before the issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for the development of a remainder parcel upon a finding by the city that fulfillment of the construction requirements is necessary for reasons of: (Government Code Section 66424.6.)

1. The public health and safety; or

2. The required construction is a necessary prerequisite to the orderly development of the surrounding area.

17.32.020 Park dedication.
A. Authority. This section is enacted under the general police power and Government Code Section 66477.

B. Requirements. As a condition of approval of a tentative or parcel map, at the option of the city, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee instead, or do a combination of both, as to be detailed in the conditions of the tentative or parcel map, for park or recreational purposes according to the standards and formula in this section.

C. General Standard.

1. The dedication of land or payment of fees, or both, shall be the proportionate amount necessary to provide five acres of park area per 1,000 persons residing within a subdivision.

2. The amount of land dedicated or fees paid is based upon the residential density. Residential density is determined on the basis of the tentative or parcel map and the average household size.

3. No land dedication or fee is required on a parcel for which park dedication requirements have previously been met.

D. Standards and Formula for Dedication of Land.

1. Where a park or recreation facility is designated in the park and recreation element of the Pittsburg general plan to be located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, the subdivider is required to dedicate the land for a local park. All park land dedicated shall conform to the provisions of this section.

2. The amount of land to be dedicated shall be determined according to the following standards and formula:

Dwelling Type

Density per DU

Park Acres per 100 Units

Single-family (detached)

3.46 persons/ unit

1.73 acres

Multiple-family (including condos/ townhomes/apartments)

2.65 persons/ unit

1.325 acres

3. The subdivider shall without credit provide: (a) full street improvements and utility connections including curbs, gutters, street paving, traffic control devices, street trees, and sidewalks adjacent to land which is dedicated under this section; (b) fencing along the property line of the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land; and (c) other minimal improvements that the city determines to be essential to the acceptance of land for residential purposes.

4. Dedication of land is governed by the procedure in subsection (K) of this section.

E. Formula for Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication.

1. If (a) there is no park or recreation facility designated in the general plan within a proposed subdivision, or (b) the dedication of land under subsection (D) of this section is not feasible or compatible with the general plan, or (c) the city has previously acquired the necessary park property, or (d) the city otherwise determines that in-lieu fees will be required, the subdivider shall pay a fee instead of land dedication.

2. The amount of an in-lieu fee required under this section shall be calculated and collected as follows:

a. Fair market value shall be determined at the time of approval of the final map covering the territory in question.

b. Any applicable in-lieu fee shall be prorated and paid on a per unit basis to the city at the time of the issuance of a building permit unless deferred to a time set forth under a fee deferral program established by resolution but certainly no later than the time of final inspection.

c. The city may, but is not required to, value and collect an in-lieu fee at an earlier date if consistent with (i) an agreement executed and signed by the party responsible for the payment of the in-lieu fee, (ii) a resolution by the city council authorizing the early payment of the in-lieu fee, and (iii) the best interests of the citizens of the city of Pittsburg.

d. Fair market value shall be the value of a typical buildable acre of land within the city suitable for residential or park land development excluding areas which are unbuildable due to flooding, topography, easements, or other restrictions. Park sites should be designed so that at least 80 percent of the site has slopes of less than three percent and should be available for year-round use.

e. The city has the sole discretion to determine what is and what is not a typical buildable acre of land for purposes of this section. The city’s determination as to what constitutes a typical buildable acre of land shall be binding for purposes of this chapter.

f. The fair market value of land for in-lieu fee purposes shall be established periodically by the city council through a city park fee resolution.

g. Biennially, or more frequently as directed by the city council, the city engineer shall determine the average fair market value of a buildable acre of land within the city. The city engineer may coordinate the appraiser of land and direct appropriate city resources for the determination of this fair market value. The city engineer’s fair market value determination shall be considered by the city council upon adoption of the city park fee resolution.

h. The city engineer may, but is not required to, hire one or more professional appraisers to assist in determining fair market value pursuant to subsection (E)(2)(g) of this section. The city engineer, and any appraiser, shall consider the following when determining fair market value for purposes of this section:

i. The general plan;

ii. Residential zoning and density;

iii. Building entitlements;

iv. Existing citywide public improvements;

v. The value of private improvements required in citywide residential developments, including the improvements listed in subsection (D) of this section;

vi. The sales price or appraised value of comparable residentially zoned property within the city utilizing data from the previous two-calendar-year period; and

vii. The sales price or appraised value of comparable residentially zoned property outside the city utilizing data from the previous two-calendar-year period.

i. The city council shall occasionally, but at least once every other fiscal year, update the city park fee resolution. The city council may, at its option, choose to update the city park fee resolution more frequently as new market information becomes available. The fair market value established in the city park fee resolution shall be applied to the calculation of all park dedication in-lieu fees required under this section.

j. The fair market value established in each city park fee resolution shall be adjusted for inflation pursuant to the Bay Area Consumer Price Index until an updated fair market value is established by the city council. When applicable, the adjusted rate shall be established each February and shall be based on the average 12-month inflation rate of the preceding 12 months.

F. Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication – Fifty Parcels or Less. If the proposed subdivision contains 50 parcels or less, the city may only require the payment of fees under this section, and may not require the dedication of land. However, this section does not preclude the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in a subdivision of 50 parcels or less if the subdivider proposes dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the city.

G. Combination of Fees and Dedication. The planning commission may approve a combination of fee payment and land dedication when:

1. Only a portion of a proposed and accepted park falls within a subdivision. That portion shall be dedicated for park purposes and a fee is required for any additional amount of land that would otherwise be required for dedication; or

2. A major part of the park or recreation site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site. The needed portion shall be acquired by dedication and a fee required for any additional amount of land that would otherwise be required for dedication; or

3. The planning commission determines that a combination of fees and dedication will best serve the public interest.

The planning commission’s determination as to fees, dedication, or a combination of both may be appealed to the city council by the party responsible for the dedication of land or the payment of in-lieu fees or by the city manager.

H. Determination of Land or Fee. Whether the city accepts land dedication or requires a fee, or a combination of both, is determined by considering the following:

1. Open space, youth and recreation element of the general plan;

2. Topography, geology, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication. Proposed park sites should be designed so that 80 percent of the site has slopes of less than three percent and should be available for year-round use;

3. Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication, specifically, proposed park sites should consist of a minimum of two contiguous acres in new residential neighborhoods;

4. The feasibility of dedication;

5. Whether the city has previously acquired sufficient land for park and recreation purposes;

6. Whether the public interest is best served by the dedication of land or the imposition of an in-lieu fee; and

7. The factors set forth in subsections (F) and (G) of this section.

I. Partial Credit for Private Open Space. Where private open space for active park and recreation uses is provided in a proposed subdivision, the city may grant partial credit not to exceed 50 percent against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees if the city finds it is in the public interest to do so and that all of the following standards are met:

1. Yard, court areas, setbacks and other open area or landscaping required to be maintained by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations are not included in the computation of credit; and

2. The private ownership and maintenance of the area is adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, covenants or restrictions; and

3. The use of the private area is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of the future owners of property within the subdivision and which cannot be amended or eliminated without the city’s consent; and

4. The proposed private area is reasonably adoptable for use for active park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location; and

5. The proposed facilities are in substantial conformance with the parks and recreation element of the general plan; and

6. The space for which credit is given is a minimum of two acres and provides a minimum of four of the following local park basis elements, or a combination of elements and other recreational improvements, which will meet the specific recreation and park needs of the future residents of the area:

Elements

Acres

a. Children’s play apparatus areas

0.50 – 0.75

b. Family picnic areas

0.25 – 0.75

c. Landscape park-like and quiet areas

0.50 – 1.00

d. Game court areas

0.25 – 0.50

e. Turf play fields

1.00 – 3.00

f. Swim pool (42 feet × 75 feet) with adjacent deck and lawn

0.25 – 0.50

g. Recreation center buildings

0.15 – 0.25

J. Credit for Park and Recreation Improvements. If the subdivider provides park and recreation improvements to the dedicated land (other than improvements required by subsection (D)(3) of this section), the value of the improvements is a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land required by this section. To qualify for credit under this subsection, the subdivider must first obtain approval from the recreation and planning commissions for the precise improvements to be installed.

K. Procedure.

1. General. When a developer submits a tentative map to the city, he shall specify as part of the filing how he intends to satisfy the park dedication requirements of this section.

2. Recommendation and Decision. At the time of approval of a tentative map, the planning commission shall determine whether to require a dedication of land, payment of a fee instead, or a combination of both.

B. Transit Facilities. The city may require a subdivider to dedicate land within the subdivision for local transit facilities such as bus turnouts, benches, shelters, landing pads, and similar items which directly benefit the residents of the subdivision. This subsection does not apply to condominium conversions. (See also Chapter 15.96 PMC.) (Government Code Section 66475.2.) [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

17.32.050 Solar access easements.
A. As a condition of approval of a tentative map, the city may require that the subdivider dedicate easements for the purpose of assuring that each parcel or unit in the subdivision has the right to receive sunlight across adjacent parcels or units in the subdivision for any solar energy system. In establishing such easements, the city shall consider the feasibility, contour, configuration of the parcel to be divided, and cost. Required easements shall not result in reducing allowable densities or the percentage of a lot that may be occupied by a building under applicable planning and zoning.

B. At the time of tentative map approval, the city engineer or the planning commission, as may be the case, shall specify:

1. The standards for determining the exact dimensions and locations of such easements;

[Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

17.32.100 Reservations.
A. General. Where a park, recreational facility, fire station, library, or other public use is shown on the general plan or specific plan, and the plan contains policies and standards for those uses, the city may require a subdivider to reserve sites for those uses, as a condition of approval of a tentative map. (Government Code Section 66479.)

B. Limitations. The reserved area must be of such a size and shape as to permit (1) the balance of the property to develop in an orderly and efficient manner, and (2) the reserved area to be efficiently used or divided if it is not acquired by a public agency. The amount of land reserved may not render development of the remaining land economically unfeasible.

C. Acquisition. The public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved shall at the time of final or parcel map approval enter into an agreement to acquire the area within two years, or longer by mutual agreement. (Government Code Sections 66480, 66481.) [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

2. At least one covered space shall be provided for each unit. Parking is prohibited in the front and street-side setback areas.

3. Where it can be demonstrated that because of the physical limitations of the site, or because there would result a severe loss of amenities due to the provision of required parking, the planning commission may reduce the number of stalls required.

I. Refurbishing and Restoration. Each main building, structure, fence, patio, enclosure, carport, accessory building, sidewalk, driveway, landscaped area and additional element as required by the planning director shall be refurbished and restored as necessary to achieve a high degree of appearance, quality and safety.

17.44.060 Effect of proposed conversion on the city’s low- and moderate-income housing supply.
In reviewing an application for conversion of an existing apartment to condominium, the planning commission shall consider the following:

A. Whether or not the amount and impact of the displacement of tenants, if the conversion is approved, would be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of the community;

B. Whether or not the existing apartment complex is serving low- and moderate-income households. Standard definitions of low- and moderate-income rents used by the federal and state governments should be used in the evaluation. Along with other factors, the planning commission should consider:

1. The number of families on current waiting lists for assisted rental housing programs that operate in Pittsburg, such as the Section 8, Section 23, and Section 236 programs,

2. The probable income range of tenants living in existing apartments, based on the assumption that households should pay between one-quarter and one-third of their income for housing. That income range will be compared with existing income limits for the Section 8 program to determine whether potential displaced tenants can be categorized as low- and moderate-income;

C. The vacancy rate and turnover rate in multiple-family rental housing in the community, and the extent to which the proposed conversion will create hardships. A conversion may be denied based upon a lack of reasonable alternative housing opportunities;

D. The need and demand for lower-cost home ownership opportunities which are increased by the conversion of apartments to condominiums;

E. The current and historical vacancy rate in the project. In evaluation of the current vacancy level under this subsection, the increase in rental rates for each unit over the preceding five years and the average monthly vacancy rate for the project over the preceding two years shall be considered. If the planning commission determines that vacancies in the project have been increased for the purpose of preparing the project for conversion, it may disapprove the tentative map;

F. Whether or not the conversion will be detrimental to the retention of low and moderate housing stock or reduce or alter significantly the opportunity within the city for the housing of young and elderly citizens. [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

17.44.070 Limitation.
The maximum number of apartment units which may be approved for condominium conversion in any one calendar year shall be limited to a number established by city council resolution at the beginning of each calendar year. The city shall consider applications on a first-come, first-served basis. If the limit is reached, subsequent applications are carried over to the next calendar year. [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

17.44.080 Findings.
The planning commission may not approve an application for condominium conversion unless it finds that the proposed conversion:

A. Conforms to the requirements of this chapter;

B. Is consistent with zoning regulations;

C. Will not displace a significant number of low- and moderate-income rental units from the city’s housing stock; and

D. Satisfies the requirements of Government Code Section 66427.1 (regarding notice to tenants). [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 1059 § 5, 1993; Ord. 962 § 1 (Exh. A), 1989.]

3. The site available for development does not provide an appropriate buildable site consistent with the site’s constraints in relation to one or more of the following: the slope, soil characteristics, seismic factors, existing and future residential development in the area of the site, the general plan and the applicable specific plan and zoning ordinance,

4. Development of the site is likely to cause environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure wildlife or their habitat,

5. The type of improvements proposed for the site will conflict with easements acquired by the public at large for access through a use of the site;

17.52.040 Procedure.
A. Notice of Intent to Determine Status of Affected Parcels. The city engineer shall mail a notice of intention to determine the status of the affected parcels by certified mail to the then current owner of record. The notice shall advise the owner that the affected parcels may be merged under the standards specified in this chapter and advise the owner of the opportunity to request a hearing on the determination of status and to present evidence at the hearing that the affected parcels do not meet the criteria for merger. (Government Code Section 66451.13.)

B. Recordation of Notice of Intent. The city engineer shall file the notice of intent to determine status for record with the recorder of Contra Costa County on the date that the notice is mailed to the property owner. (Government Code Section 66451.13.)

C. Hearing. If the property owner files with the city a request for a hearing on determination of status within 30 days after recordation of the notice of intent to determine status, the planning director shall fix the time and date and place for a hearing to be conducted by the planning commission. The planning director shall notify the property owner by certified mail of the hearing. The planning commission shall conduct a hearing not less than 30 days after the city has received the property owner’s request for a hearing. The hearing date may be postponed or continued with the mutual consent of the planning commission and the property owner. (Government Code Sections 66451.14, 66454.15.)

D. Determination of Status Following Hearing. At the hearing, the property owner may present evidence that the affected parcels do not meet the standards for merger specified in this chapter. At the conclusion of the hearing, the planning commission shall determine whether the affected parcels are to be merged or are not to be merged, and shall notify the owner of its determination. (Government Code Section 66451.16.)

E. Recordation of Notice of Merger. The city engineer shall cause a notice of merger specifying the names of the record owners and particularly describing the real property to be recorded within 30 days after conclusion of the hearing. (Government Code Section 66451.16.)

F. Determination of Merger Where No Hearing Requested. If, within the 30-day period after recordation of the notice of intent to determine status, the owner of the affected parcel does not file a request for a hearing, the planning commission may at any time thereafter make a determination that the affected parcels are to be merged or are not to be merged. A notice of merger shall be recorded not later than 90 days after the date when the community development director mailed the notice of intent to determine status. (Government Code Section 66451.17.)

G. Determination Not to Merge. If the planning commission determines that the affected parcels are not to be merged, the city engineer shall have recorded a release of the notice of intent to determine status and shall mail a clearance letter to the then current owner of record. If a property owner initiates or consents in writing to a lot merger, the city engineer may cause the merger of the affected lots without referring to the proposed merger to the planning commission for a public hearing. (Government Code Section 66451.18.) [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

A. 1. No person shall sell, lease, or finance a parcel of real property or begin construction of a building for sale, lease or financing thereon (except for model homes) or allow occupancy thereof, for which a parcel or final map is required by the Subdivision Map Act or this title, until the map complies with the Subdivision Map Act and this title and is recorded with the county recorder. (Government Code Section 66499.30.)

2. This subsection (A) does not prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease or finance real property or to construct improvements where the sale, lease or financing or the beginning of construction, is expressly conditioned upon the approval and filing of a final map or parcel map.

B. The conveyance of part of a division of real property for which a final or parcel map is required shall not be made by parcel or block number, letter or other designation until the map is recorded with the county recorder.

C. This section does not apply to a parcel of a subdivision offered for sale or lease, contracted for sale or lease, or sold or leased in compliance with or exempt from any law, including this title, regulating the design and improvement of subdivisions in effect at the time the subdivision was established. [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

17.60.020 Penalty for violation.
A violation of this title by a person who is the subdivider or an owner of record, at the time of the violation, of property involved in the violation is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in the state prison, by a fine not exceeding $10,000, or by both that fine and imprisonment. Every other violation of this division is a misdemeanor. (Government Code Section 66499.31.) [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

17.60.030 Remedies.
A. Conveyance Voidable. A deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell real property which has been divided or which results from a division in violation of the Subdivision Map Act or this title, is voidable at the sole option of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, or the heirs, personal representative, or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy within one year after the date of discovery of the violation. However, the deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell is binding upon a successor-in-interest of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, other than those above enumerated, and upon the grantor, vendor or person contracting to sell, or his or her assignee, heir or devisee. (Government Code Section 66499.32.)

B. Other Legal Action. This title does not bar any legal, equitable or summary remedy to which the city or the public agency, or any other person may otherwise be entitled. The city or other public agency or person may file a suit in the superior court to restrain or enjoin an attempted or proposed subdivision for sale, lease or financing in violation of the Subdivision Map Act or this title. (Government Code Section 66499.33.)

C. Denial of Permits and Approvals. The city shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop real property which has been divided or which has resulted from a division in violation of the Subdivision Map Act or this title if it finds that development of the property is contrary to the public health or the public safety. The authority to deny or approve such a permit applies whether the applicant was the owner of record at the time of the violation or whether the applicant is either the current owner of record or a vendee of the current owner with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of an interest in the property. (Government Code Section 66499.34.)

D. Permit or Approval Subject to Conditions. If the city issues a permit or grants approval for the development of any real property illegally subdivided, the city may impose those additional conditions which would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the current owner of record acquired the property. If a conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record in accordance with the provision of PMC 17.60.040, only the conditions stipulated in that certificate are applicable. (Government Code Section 66499.34.) [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

17.60.040 Certificate of compliance.
A. A person owning real property or a vendee of such person under a contract of sale may request the city engineer to determine whether the real property complies with the provision of the Subdivision Map Act and this title. A written application for a certificate of compliance shall be accompanied by a current preliminary title report showing the legal owner of the property. (Government Code Section 66499.35.)

B. If the city engineer determines that the real property complies with the provision of the Subdivision Map Act and this title, the engineer shall file a certificate of compliance for record with the county recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and shall state that the division thereof complies with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and this title.

C. 1. If the city engineer determines that the real property does not comply with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or this title, the city engineer may, as a condition to granting a certificate of compliance, impose conditions in accordance with PMC 17.60.030(D). Upon the city engineer’s making such a determination and establishing such conditions, the engineer shall file a conditional certificate of compliance for record with the county recorder. The certificate shall serve as notice to the property owner and any successor that the fulfillment and implementation of such conditions shall be required before subsequent issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property.

2. Compliance with such conditions is not required until the city issues a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property.

D. A recorded final map, parcel map or official map (prepared in accord with Government Code Section 66499.35E) constitutes a certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described on the map.

E. The applicant for a certificate of compliance shall pay the city a fee to cover the reasonable cost of processing the application. [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

17.60.050 Notice of violation.
A. Notice of Intention to Record Notice of Violation. If the department has knowledge that real property has been divided in violation of the Subdivision Map Act or this title, the city engineer shall mail by certified mail to the current owner a notice of intention to record a notice of violation. The notice shall describe the property in detail, name the owners, describe the violation, why the subject parcel is not lawful under Section 66412.6(a) or (b) of the Subdivision Map Act and state that the owner will be given the opportunity to present evidence. The notice shall specify the date, time and place for a meeting at which the owner may present evidence to the city engineer why a notice of violation should not be recorded. (Government Code Section 66499.36.)

B. Meeting. The meeting shall be held no sooner than 30 days and no later than 60 days from that date of mailing of the notice of intention to record a notice of violation.

C. Clearance if No Violation. If, after the owner has presented evidence, the city engineer determines that there has been no violation, the department shall mail a clearance letter to the then current owner of record.

D. Recording Notice of Violation. The city engineer shall record the notice of violation with the county recorder if:

1. Within 15 days of receipt of the notice, the owner fails to file with the department a written objection to recording the notice of violation; or

2. After the owner has presented evidence, the city engineer determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided.

E. Effect of Recording. The notice of violation, when recorded, is constructive notice of the violation to all successors-in-interest in the property. [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

17.60.060 Judicial review.
A. An action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void or annul a decision of the city under this title must be commenced and served on the city within 90 days after the date of the decision. After 90 days, all persons are barred from any such action. (Government Code Section 66499.37.)

B. The issues raised in an action may be limited to those raised in the public hearing or in written correspondence presented before or at the hearing. (Government Code Section 65009.) [Ord. 09-1315 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 962 § 2 (Exh. A), 1989.]

Article I. Application and Interpretation

18.06.010 Purpose and applicability.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide precision in interpretation of the zoning regulations. The meaning and construction of words and phrases defined in this chapter apply throughout the zoning regulations, except where the context indicates a different meaning. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. B), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.06.020 Rules for construction of language.
The following rules of construction apply in addition to the general provisions of PMC Title 1.

A. The particular controls the general;

B. Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, the following conjunctions shall be interpreted as follows:

1. “And” indicates that all connected words and provisions apply,

2. “Or” indicates that the connected words or provisions may apply singly or in any combination,

3. “Either...or” indicates that the connected words or provisions apply singly but not in combination;

C. In case of conflict between the text and a diagram, the text controls;

D. References to departments, commissions, boards and other offices or instrumentalities are to those of the city unless otherwise indicated;

E. A reference to a public official of the city is to that person who performs the function referred to and includes a designated deputy of the official;

F. A reference to days is to calendar days unless otherwise specified by state law. If a deadline falls on a weekend or holiday, the time for performing an act is extended to the next working day. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. B), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.06.030 General rules for applicability of zoning regulations.
A. Applicability to Property. Zoning regulations apply to all land within the city including land owned by the city and other local, state and federal agencies to the extent provided by law. Application of regulations to specific lots is governed by the zoning map.

B. Applicability to Streets and Rights-of-Way. A public street, utility, and other right-of-way is considered to be in the same zoning district as the property to which it is contiguous. Nothing in this subsection is intended to make the zoning regulations applicable to a public utility easement or right-of-way under the control of the city; provided, however, that all wireless facilities in the public right-of-way shall be subject to Article XX (Wireless Telecommunications Facilities) of Chapter 18.84 PMC. Where contiguous property is classified in a different zoning district, the centerline of the street or right-of-way is the district boundary, unless otherwise depicted on the zoning map.

C. Compliance with Regulations. No land may be used, and no structure may be constructed, occupied, enlarged, altered, or moved in any zoning district except in accord with this title.

D. Public Nuisance. Neither this title nor the approval of a permit authorized by this title authorizes the maintenance of a public nuisance.

E. Compliance with Public Notice Requirements. Compliance with public notice requirements prescribed by this title is sufficient notice to allow the city to proceed with a public hearing and take action on an application, regardless of actual receipt of mailed or delivered notice.

F. Requests for Notice. Where this title requires that notice be given by first class mail to “any person who has filed a written request for such notice,” that request must be filed with the city planner and is subject to the applicable fee.

G. Conflict with Other Regulations. Where a conflict occurs between this title and another city ordinance, resolution, guideline, or regulation, the more restrictive provision controls unless otherwise specified in this title.

H. Relation to Private Agreements. This title does not affect or annul an easement, covenant, or agreement. However, if this title imposes a greater restriction than imposed by an easement, covenant, or agreement, this title controls.

I. Relation to Prior Ordinance. This title supersedes prior zoning regulations of the city. However, this title does not validate or legalize a land use or structure established, constructed, or maintained in violation of prior zoning regulations.

J. Zoning of Annexed Land. The zoning administrator may conduct a study to determine the most appropriate general plan designation for land proposed for annexation to the city, and may recommend prezoning consistent with the general plan designation. If prezoning is approved by the planning commission and the city council, the zoning becomes effective upon annexation. Land annexed without prior prezoning shall be zoned S as prescribed by Chapter 18.64 PMC.

K. Application During Local Emergency. The city council may authorize a deviation from a provision of this title during a local emergency declared and ratified under Chapter 2.44 PMC. The city council may authorize a deviation by resolution without notice or public hearing.

L. Severability. If a section, subsection, sentence, or phrase of this title is for any reason held to be invalid, the remaining portions of this title are not affected. It is expressly declared that this title and each section, subsection, sentence, and phrase would have been adopted regardless of the fact that a portion of this title would be declared invalid. [Ord. 16-1418 § 4 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. B), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.06.040 Rules for interpretation.
A. Zoning Regulations. Where uncertainty exists regarding the interpretation of a provision of this title or its application to a specific site, the zoning administrator shall determine the intent of the provision.

B. Zoning Map. Where uncertainty exists regarding the boundary of a zoning district, the following rules apply:

1. A district boundary shown as approximately following the property line of a lot is construed to follow that property line.

2. On unsubdivided land, or where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of the district boundary is determined by using the scale appearing on the zoning map, unless the boundary location is indicated by dimensions printed on the map.

3. A district boundary shown as approximately following the right-of-way line of a freeway, alley, railroad, or other identifiable boundary line is construed to follow the right-of-way or boundary line.

4. A district boundary shown as lying within, but not generally contiguous to, a right-of-way line of a freeway, street, alley, railroad, or other identifiable boundary line is construed to follow the centerline of the right-of-way or boundary line.

5. Where a conflict occurs between the zoning districts and district boundaries depicted on the zoning map and the land use designations and land use designation boundaries depicted on the land use diagram in the general plan, the general plan land use diagram governs.

6. If an uncertainty remains as to the location of a district boundary or other feature shown on the zoning map, the location shall be determined by the zoning administrator.

C. Appeal. An interpretation of the zoning regulations or zoning map by the zoning administrator may be appealed to the planning commission, as provided in PMC 18.18.050. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. B), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.06.050 Effect of this title on previously approved project or projects in process.
A. A use permit, variance, design review approval, or tentative parcel or subdivision map, which is valid on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title remains valid until its expiration date.

B. This title does not require a change in plans, construction or designated use of a structure for which a building permit was issued before June 20, 2007, or a later amendment to it.

C. A reapplication for an expired permit must meet the standards in effect at the time of reapplication.

D. A permit issued before June 20, 2007, that is proposed to be modified after June 20, 2007, may only be approved in accordance with this title. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. B), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.06.060 Consolidation of applications.
An applicant may request that two or more applications for separate discretionary permits requested or required in conjunction with a project be consolidated. The findings and decisions for each permit must be considered individually. However, for the purpose of discretionary action, these multiple permits constitute one project. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. B), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.06.065 Applicability of land use and development regulations.
A. Zoning Designation System. Land use, development regulations and performance standards applicable to a specific site are shown on the zoning map by a zoning designation consisting of classes of letter designators:

1. A land use regulation designator indicates the principal land uses permitted or conditionally permitted in each district.

2. An overlay district designator is included in a zoning designation if the provisions of one or more overlay districts apply to a site.

3. An ordinance number is added to a specified zoning designation and overlay district to reference the enabling legislation and specific regulations.

18.28.110    Procedure for revocation of use permit or variance.

18.28.010 Purpose and intent.
A. Use permit and a variance provide flexibility in the application of land use and development regulations when necessary to achieve the purposes of this title.

1. Use Permit. A use permit is typically required for a use classification having unusual site development features or operating characteristics requiring special consideration so that the use may be designed, located, and operated compatibly with uses on adjoining properties and in the surrounding area.

2. Variance. A variance is intended to resolve practical difficulties or unnecessary physical hardships that may result from the size, shape, or dimensions of a site or the location of an existing structure on it; from geographic, topographic, or other physical conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity; or from street locations or traffic conditions in the immediate vicinity of the site. The cost to an applicant of strict compliance with a regulation may not be the sole reason for granting a variance.

B. A variance may be granted with respect to landscaping, screening, site area, site coverage, site dimension, yard, height of structure (except a fence or wall), distances between structures, open space, off-street parking and off-street loading, frontage, performance standard, or other regulation affecting the size, shape or design of a site or the placement of a building on it.

C. The authority to grant a variance does not extend to use regulations because the flexibility necessary to avoid results inconsistent with the land use objectives of this title is provided by the use permit process for specified uses and by the authority of the zoning administrator to determine whether a specific use belongs within one or more of the use classifications listed in Chapter 18.08 PMC. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.28.020 Authority to grant.
A. Use Permit. Unless otherwise designated by this title for review by the zoning administrator, the planning commission shall hear and decide each application for a use permit.

B. Variance. The zoning administrator shall hear and decide each application for a variance. [Ord. 15-1390 § 3 (Exh. C), 2015; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007.]

18.28.030 Conditions of approval.
A. The reviewing body may impose such reasonable conditions to the grant of use permit or variance as it considers necessary to:

1. Carry out the purpose and intent of this title and the purpose of the land use district in which the property is located;

2. Comply with the general plan;

3. Protect the public health, safety and general welfare; and

4. Ensure that the operation of the use is compatible with existing and potential uses on properties in the surrounding area.

B. The conditions that may be imposed include, but are not limited to, dedication of right-of-way, construction of public facilities and other improvements, plan approval, architectural standards, access controls, time limitation, phasing of improvements, planting and screening. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.28.040 Variances in new subdivisions.
A variance in the requirements necessary to the consideration of a tentative map of a subdivision may be considered and granted or denied in accordance with and as part of the consideration governing the approval of subdivisions. Notice of the hearing shall be given as for notice of the hearing on an application for a variance (PMC 18.14.020). [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.28.050 Temporary activity permits.
A temporary activity permit authorizing a temporary use is subject to the following provisions:

A. Duties of the City Planner. The city planner shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application. No notice or public hearing is required.

B. Required Findings. A temporary activity permit may only be granted if the city planner finds that:

1. The proposed temporary use will be located, operated, and maintained consistent with the policies of the general plan and the provisions of this title; and

2. Approval of the application will not be detrimental to property or improvements in the surrounding area or to the public health, safety, or general welfare.

C. Conditions of Approval. In approving a temporary activity permit, the city planner may impose conditions necessary to:

1. Achieve the general purposes of this title and the specific purposes of the land use district in which the temporary use will be located;

2. Protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; and

3. Ensure operation and maintenance of the temporary use in a manner compatible with existing uses in the surrounding area.

D. Effective Date – Duration – Appeals. The temporary activity permit is valid for a specified time period not to exceed 45 days. A temporary activity permit lapses if not used within the dates approved. The city planner may revoke the permit effective immediately upon verbal or written notice for violation of the terms of the permit. The city planner may approve changes in a temporary activity permit. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.28.060 Modification of use permit, variance, temporary activity permit or change in conditions.
A request for a change in a condition of approval of a use permit, variance, a temporary activity permit or a change to development plans that would affect a condition of approval shall be treated as a new application. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.28.070 Exercise and use of use permit or variance.
If a use permit or variance is not exercised, used or established within one year of its grant or the time otherwise specified in the permit, the permit automatically expires. A use permit or variance issued under this title is considered to be exercised, used or established when, within one year of its grant or within the time otherwise specified in it, a building permit is issued for the purpose and location described in it. If no building permit is required to establish the variance, use or other matter granted, then the permit is considered to be exercised, used or established when clear and visible evidence as to its beginning and reasonable progress toward completion is demonstrated.

A time period stated in the permit governs over this provision. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.28.080 Extension of initial period for use permit or variance.
A. Use Permit. In the case of a use permit, upon a showing of good cause the applicable original reviewing body may extend the period for initially exercising the use permit for a maximum of one additional year.

B. Variance. In the case of a variance, upon a showing of good cause the zoning administrator may, after notice to the planning commission, extend the period for initially exercising a variance for a maximum of one additional year. [Ord. 15-1390 § 3 (Exh. C), 2015; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.28.090 Expiration upon discontinuance of use permit or variance.
If a use is established under a use permit or variance and the use is discontinued for any reason for a period of nine months, the permit becomes void and the use may not be resumed. Upon application during the nine-month period by the owner and upon a showing of good cause, the city planner may grant an extension not to exceed a total of three months. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.28.100 Grounds for revocation of use permit or variance.
The planning commission may revoke a use permit or variance on any of the following grounds:

A. Violation of a zoning regulation of the city;

B. Violation of a term, limitation or condition;

C. Causing or allowing a nuisance in connection with the premises; or

D. Conviction of a violation of federal or state law or city ordinance in connection with the operation of the permitted use. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.28.110 Procedure for revocation of use permit or variance.
If the planning commission finds that there is probable cause for revoking a use permit or variance, the planning commission shall direct the city planner to give notice of a hearing to the permittee and the public in the same manner as prescribed for the original application.

The public hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as the original application, except that the city has the burden of proving the grounds for revocation. If the planning commission finds that grounds for revocation exist, it may revoke the use permit or variance or impose conditions to its continuance.

An order revoking or failing to revoke a use permit or variance may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the provisions of this title relating to appeals on original applications. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.30.010 Purpose and intent.
It is the policy of the city of Pittsburg, pursuant to the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, to provide individuals with disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices and procedures to ensure equal access to housing and facilitate the development of housing for individuals with disabilities. This chapter establishes a procedure for making requests for reasonable accommodation in land use, zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures to comply fully with the intent and purpose of fair housing laws. [Ord. 15-1389 § 3 (Exh. A), 2015.]

18.30.020 Definitions.
A. “Disabled person” means any person who has a medical condition, physical disability, or mental disability that substantially limits one or more of the person’s major life activities; has a record of such impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment, as those terms are defined in the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Government Code Sections 12925 through 12928, as may be amended from time to time).

B. “Fair housing laws” means the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (42 USC Section 3601 et seq.) and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Government Code Sections 12900 et seq.), as those acts may be amended from time to time.

C. “Reasonable accommodations” provide flexibility in the application of land use and zoning regulations and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities for disabled persons. Reasonable accommodations may include, but are not limited to, the following: yard area modifications for ramps, handrails or other such accessibility improvements; hardscape additions such as widened driveways, parking areas or walkways; building additions for accessibility; tree removal; or any other standard that inhibits accessibility. Reasonable accommodation does not include an accommodation that would (1) impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; (2) require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city’s land use and zoning program; or (3) waive a land use regulation of this title. [Ord. 15-1389 § 3 (Exh. A), 2015.]

18.30.030 Applicability.
This chapter shall apply when the application of standard land use, zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures interferes with a disabled individual’s use or enjoyment of the dwelling unit in which the individual resides. [Ord. 15-1389 § 3 (Exh. A), 2015.]

18.30.040 Application requirements.
A. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be made by a qualified applicant or his or her designee and submitted on an application form provided by the city planner. The application shall contain the following information:

1. The applicant’s name, address and telephone number. If applicable, applicant designee’s name, address and telephone number.

2. The property owner’s name, address and telephone number, if different from the applicant.

3. Address of the property for which the request is being made.

4. The current actual use of the property.

5. The zoning code provision, building regulation or policy from which reasonable accommodation is being requested.

6. The type of accommodation sought and the basis for the claim for which a request for reasonable accommodation is sought and documentation to support such claim.

7. The reason that the requested accommodation is reasonable and necessary for the individual(s) with the disability to use and enjoy the housing.

8. If the disability is not permanent, an indication of the timing and anticipated duration for needing the reasonable accommodation, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

9. Additional information to support the request including, but not limited to, copies of memoranda, correspondence, pictures, plans, background information or other supportive information consistent with fair housing laws.

B. Review with Other Land Use Applications. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires another discretionary approval including but not limited to conditional use permit, design review, general plan amendment, zoning amendment or other approval, the applicant shall file the information required in subsection (A) of this section together for concurrent review with the application for discretionary approval.

C. If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the city will provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible.

D. Any information identified by an applicant as confidential shall be retained in a manner so as to respect the privacy rights of the applicant and, to the extent permitted by law, shall not be made available for public inspection. [Ord. 15-1389 § 3 (Exh. A), 2015.]

18.30.050 Authority to grant.
A. City Planner. Requests for reasonable accommodation for a single-family home shall be reviewed by the city planner or designee if there are no additional discretionary approvals sought other than the request for reasonable accommodation.

B. Other Review Authority. Requests for reasonable accommodation for residential uses other than a single-family home or a request for a reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the zoning administrator, planning commission, or city council, as applicable. [Ord. 15-1389 § 3 (Exh. A), 2015.]

18.30.060 Review procedure.
A. City Planner Review. If the application for reasonable accommodation is not for residential uses other than a single-family home, and is not accompanied by any other discretionary application, the city planner shall issue a written decision within 30 days after the application is deemed complete if the requested reasonable accommodation is found to be in accordance with PMC 18.30.070 (Decision).

B. Other Reviewing Authority. In the event that the request for reasonable accommodation is for uses other than a single-family home or is accompanied by other discretionary applications, the planning commission or city council, as applicable, shall issue a written decision on the reasonable accommodation request at the same time as it makes a decision on the discretionary application. In reviewing the request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority shall consider no criteria other than those described in PMC 18.30.070 (Decision), regardless of its review of applications for other land use entitlements or the criteria for considering such other applications.

C. If necessary to reach a decision on the request for reasonable accommodation, and if consistent with fair housing laws, the city planner or other reviewing authority may request further information from the applicant specifying in detail the information that is required. Such additional information may include, but is not limited to, copies of memoranda, correspondence, pictures, plans, background information or other supportive information consistent with fair housing laws. In the event that a request for additional information is made, the 30-day period to issue a decision is stayed until the applicant provides the requested information.

The notice shall include the address of the reasonable accommodation and a general description of the requested accommodation. The notice shall specify the date on which the decision on the reasonable accommodation is scheduled to be made, and shall provide an explanation of the means by which owners of property within the specified radius can provide written or verbal comments on the reasonable accommodation request on or prior to the scheduled date of the decision.

2. Notwithstanding subsection (D)(1) of this section, if one or more discretionary actions requiring a public hearing are associated with a reasonable accommodation request, the notice of consideration of a reasonable accommodation request shall be provided as part of and in the same manner as the notice required for the related discretionary action, as specified in PMC 18.14.020. [Ord. 15-1389 § 3 (Exh. A), 2015.]

18.30.070 Decision.
A. Findings. The reviewing authority shall grant the request for reasonable accommodation if it can make the following findings:

1. The housing that is the subject of the request will be utilized by a disabled individual pursuant to fair housing laws;

2. The request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability pursuant to fair housing laws;

3. The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; and

4. The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city’s land use, zoning or building regulations.

B. Notice to Applicant. Notice of the reviewing authority’s decision shall be provided to the applicant. The written decision shall give notice of the applicant’s right to appeal and to request reasonable accommodation in the appeals process as set forth in PMC 18.30.090.

18.30.080 Conditions of approval.
In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority (city planner, zoning administrator, planning commission or city council) may impose conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with PMC 18.30.070 (Decision), and may offer alternative reasonable accommodations that may provide an equivalent level of benefit. Conditions may be imposed to ensure that any removable structures or physical design features that are constructed or installed in association with the reasonable accommodation be removed once those structures or physical design features are no longer necessary to afford the individual with a disability for whom the reasonable accommodation was granted; or to reduce impacts on neighbors and to preserve the character of the surrounding environment. [Ord. 15-1389 § 3 (Exh. A), 2015.]

18.30.090 Appeal of decision.
A. A decision related to a request for reasonable accommodation for a multifamily residential use may be appealed in accordance with Chapter 18.18 PMC (Decisions and Appeals).

B. A decision related to a request for reasonable accommodation for a single-family residential use may be appealed in accordance with Chapter 18.18 PMC (Decisions and Appeals), except that only the applicant, the applicant’s representative and owners of property within 300 feet of the project location may appeal a decision made under this chapter.

C. If an individual needs assistance in filing an appeal on an adverse decision, the city will provide assistance to ensure that the appeals process is accessible.

18.36.010 Findings and statement of policy.
A. Findings. The city council finds that:

1. The appearance of open spaces, buildings, and structures has a material and substantial relationship to the health, safety and general welfare; properties characterized by one or more of the conditions set forth in subsection (A)(2) of this section affect the health, safety and general welfare of the city;

2. Neighborhoods can and will deteriorate because of poor planning, neglect of proper design standards, the existence of buildings and structures unsuitable to and incompatible with the character of the neighborhood and the character of the community. This has resulted in the lowering of property values, the discouraging of maintenance and improvement of surrounding properties, has precluded the most appropriate development of other properties in the vicinity, and has impaired the public health, safety and welfare;

3. The quality of life and stable property values are enhanced by good quality design. The city should take positive steps to encourage quality design in all land use districts.

B. Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the city to prevent deterioration and to preserve and enhance property values, the visual character of the community and the public health, safety and welfare of its citizens. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.36.020 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the review of the design of projects proposed in all land use districts.

Design control should be the minimum necessary to achieve the objectives of the chapter and the policy of the city. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.36.100 Design review procedure in single-family land use districts.
A. Duty to Review. The city planner shall review each application for a building permit in a single-family land use district where the proposed construction is aboveground or materially alters the existing grade; provided, however, that all wireless facilities in the public right-of-way shall be subject to Article XX (Wireless Telecommunications Facilities) of PMC Chapter 18.84. The purpose of this review is to avoid substandard development and to ensure that improvements within residential neighborhoods maintain consistent standards of design and to ensure that development is consistent with criteria adopted under PMC 18.36.120.

B. Procedure for Review.

1. If the city planner finds that the application is consistent with the criteria adopted under PMC 18.36.120, the city planner shall approve issuance of a building permit.

2. If the city planner finds the application is inconsistent with the criteria adopted under PMC 18.36.120, the city planner shall advise the building inspector and the building inspector may not issue the building permit.

3. If the city planner is in doubt as to whether the application is consistent with the criteria adopted under PMC 18.36.120, the city planner shall notify the planning commission and it shall at its next scheduled meeting act upon the application. [Ord. 16-1418 § 4 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. C), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.36.110 Design review for subdivisions of five or more lots.
In the case of a single-family residential subdivision of five or more lots where the subdivider intends to build single-family residences and at the time of the subdivision approval process the subdivider has prepared building designs, the design review process shall be undertaken by the planning commission concurrently with the subdivision approval process.

Article III. Design Review in Land Use Districts Other Than Single-Family Residential

18.36.200 Design review procedure in land use districts other than single-family residential.
The planning commission shall review the design of the building proposed in an application for a land use permit or a building permit, as the case may be, in each land use district other than single-family residential.

The city council shall adopt design guidelines that shall be applied by the zoning administrator, the planning commission, and on appeal, the city council, in any application for a zoning permit in that portion of the downtown designated commercial core, as depicted in Figure 5-1 of the general plan, as amended from time to time.

a.    Residential projects that incorporate more than the minimum number of affordable units required under Chapter 18.86 PMC are permitted an increase in the maximum density identified in this schedule. For each two percent increase in deed restricted lower-income units offered above that required by Chapter 18.86 PMC, lot area per unit may be reduced 100 square feet per unit and minimum lot area may be reduced 2,000 square feet.

    In no case, however, shall lot area per unit be less than 1,100 square feet per residential unit, nor shall minimum lot area be less than 22,000 square feet.

b.    Residential projects that incorporate more than the minimum number of affordable units required under Chapter 18.86 PMC are permitted an increase in the maximum density identified in this schedule. For each two percent increase in deed restricted lower-income units offered above that required by Chapter 18.86 PMC, lot area per unit may be reduced 100 square feet per unit and minimum lot area may be reduced 2,000 square feet.

    In no case, however, shall lot area per unit be less than 1,100 square feet per residential unit, nor shall minimum lot area be less than 22,000 square feet, unless the planning commission finds that the site encompasses an entire city block and that the area of the given city block is not adequate in size to support 20 or more units. Alternatively, the planning commission may find that a multifamily development consisting of fewer than 20 units would better serve the public interest because more than 50 percent of the units in the development would be rental units with three or more bedrooms. Upon making one or both of the findings stated above, minimum site area may be reduced to no less than 18,000 square feet.

c.    The minimum required rear yard may be reduced to 10 feet for a residential property located in a subdivision with a tentative map approved prior to June 20, 2007.

d.    Each private storage space required by this section shall have minimum horizontal area of 24 square feet, and shall consist of enclosed, weather-proofed and lockable private storage space in addition to guest, linen, pantry, and clothes closets customarily provided. The space for each unit may be provided in a location approved by the city planner, but must not be divided into two or more locations.

e.    Each private open space required by this section shall have a horizontal dimension of no less than six feet of length or width. On-site recreation facilities and common open space (other than required front and street side yards and parking facilities) may be used as credit towards this requirement.

f.    Interior side yard setbacks shall be a minimum 10 percent of the lot width, with a three-foot minimum and a five-foot maximum required. This section shall not be construed as to disallow side yard setbacks greater than five feet. If, in applying the requirements of this section, a fractional number is obtained, the required setback shall be rounded to the nearest half-foot increment.

[Ord. 17-1433 § 4 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 05-1257 § 4, 2005; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly Schedule 18.50.015.]

18.50.115 Planting areas.
A. Yards Adjoining Streets. All visible portions of a required yard adjoining a street must be planting area or hardscape that includes parking areas, driveways and walks, as well as areas covered by ornamental gravel, crushed rock or similar materials.

B. Interior Yards. In the RM and RH districts, at least 50 percent of each required interior side yard and rear yard must be planting area having a minimum width of five feet adjoining a side or rear property line; provided, that the width of a required planting area may be reduced to two feet in a side or rear yard adjoining a driveway and an accessory structure may occupy a portion of the planting area in a rear yard. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.330(C).]

18.50.120 Exterior materials.
In each R district, the exterior walls of each structure, other than an accessory structure, must have a nonmetallic finish. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.305.]

18.50.123 Senior housing units.
A. Within each subdivision or site intended for, or building within which the residents of the dwelling units are, senior citizens, all of the dwelling units designated for occupancy by senior citizens shall be handicapped accessible.

B. Notwithstanding the off-street parking requirements identified in PMC 18.78.040(A), the minimum off-street parking requirements for housing units designated for occupancy by senior citizens shall be determined by the zoning administrator or planning commission, as appropriate, in conjunction with the zoning approval process. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007.]

18.50.125 Development standards and amenities applicable to all multifamily residential projects.
A. Laundry Facilities. A residential site containing multifamily residential units must have either a laundry area in each unit or a common laundry area consisting of not less than one automatic washer and dryer for each five units or fractional part.

B. Park Land Dedication. Each multifamily rental housing project is subject to the park land dedication requirements prescribed by PMC 17.32.020 because apartments contribute to increased demand for community and neighborhood parks in the same manner as condominiums and single-family housing. The applicant must dedicate land or pay a fee, or dedicate land and pay a fee in combination as provided by PMC 17.32.020(G). The partial credit for private open space improvement and common open space allowed under PMC 17.32.020(I) applies to multifamily rental housing projects if the standards of that section and all of the following conditions are met:

1. The multifamily rental housing project incorporates an affordability component that exceeds, by five or more percent, the minimum requirement for dedication of lower-income renter units as specified in PMC 18.86.060; and

2. At least 25 percent of the units within the multifamily rental project have three or more bedrooms; and

3. At least 50 percent of the units with three or more bedrooms are lower-income renter units; and

4. Five or more of the park elements identified in PMC 17.32.020(I)(6) are provided on-site and incorporated into the design of the improvements for the rental housing project.

Fees required pursuant to this subsection are calculated according to a schedule adopted by the city council by resolution or ordinance and are payable at the time a building permit is issued. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007.]

18.50.130 Garage or carport exception for single-family dwellings.
A single-family dwelling constructed in a subdivision approved before December 31, 1961, except for those listed in subsection (E) of this section, that has subsequently and with zoning approval had the garage or carport converted to be used for other than the storage of automobiles is considered to be in conformance with this title and is subject to the following conditions:

A. After the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, the owner of such property who wishes to convert the garage or carport must make an application for zoning approval from the city planner. A processing fee shall accompany the application in the amount set forth by city council resolution.

B. The application for zoning approval must be accompanied by plans and elevations necessary to show the detail of the lot and converted area.

C. The city planner may approve the garage or carport conversion and issue a zoning permit if the structure meets the requirements of the building division and housing code contained in this code.

D. The applicant must apply and pay for any permit required or that would have been required under PMC Title 15 for the alteration work. All such work shall be inspected and approved by the building official.

E. This exemption does not apply to any building constructed within the above-mentioned subdivisions that were constructed after one year from December 31, 1961, and to the following subdivisions:

Hillview Subdivision No. 2327;

The Highlands Subdivision No. 2639;

Ridgeview Terrace Subdivision No. 2930. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.315.]

Article III. Performance Standards

18.50.200 Outdoor storage.
A. Storage of Unsightly Objects and Other Equipment. A person may not store, park, or place a camper shell, sofa, appliance, mechanical equipment, or any other unsightly objects in the front yard or in the corner side yard of an occupied lot or in any part of a vacant lot in an R district for a period of more than 24 hours in any one calendar month. This does not apply to building material or equipment for use on the site during the time a building permit is in effect for construction on the premises.

B. Placement of Automobiles. A person may not keep, store, park, or allow to be parked or left unattended any automobile (whether or not registered or capable of operation) on any unpaved portion of a front or corner side yard.

C. Placement of Vehicles and Vessels. A person may not keep, store, park, or allow to be parked or left unattended on a property any boat, utility or travel trailer, or recreational vehicle, except as allowed by PMC 18.78.070. [Ord. 07-1294 § 3, 2007; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.405.]

18.50.205 Repairs and related work.
A. Site Location Limitations. A person may not park, store, place or allow to remain in the front yard or the comer side yard of an occupied lot or in any part of a vacant lot in an R district any motor vehicle, motorcycle, bicycle, boat, trailer, camper shell, household appliance, or other mechanical apparatus or device for the purpose of disassembling, constructing, reconstructing, repairing, or servicing. However, a person may perform repair or related work on an item referred to on a driveway within a front or corner side yard of a lot occupied by a main building for a period of no more than 24 hours at a time, or for no more than 24 hours in any one calendar month. Such repair or related work is limited to work conducted on a vehicle registered to, or other item owned by, a resident of the property.

B. Nighttime Repair Work. A person may not disassemble, construct, reconstruct, repair, or service an item referred to in subsection (A) of this section outside a building in an R district between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.

C. Spray Painting, Welding and Burning. A person may not operate spray painting, welding or burning equipment that uses compressed gas or a similar device, in the front yard or in the corner side yard of an occupied lot or in any part of a vacant lot in an R district, for the purpose of painting, repairing, wrecking, dismantling, assembling, fabricating, or constructing an item referred to in subsection (A) of this section.

Article IV. Accessory Dwelling Units

18.50.300 General.
This article is intended to implement the general plan housing policy on accessory dwelling units, adopted in part in response to Government Code Section 65852.1 et seq., by allowing an accessory dwelling unit in residential districts, subject to approval by the city planner. [Ord. 17-1433 § 4 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 05-1257 § 4, 2005; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.100.]

18.50.302 Definition.
An “accessory dwelling unit” shall mean an attached or detached residential dwelling that is subordinate to a primary dwelling on the same lot, and that provides complete independent and permanent facilities for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as the primary dwelling. An accessory dwelling unit may include a prefabricated or manufactured home on a permanent foundation.

A “primary dwelling” refers to the main single-family dwelling unit on site, absent the space devoted to or designated as the accessory dwelling unit. [Ord. 17-1433 § 4 (Exh. A), 2017.]

18.50.305 Where permitted.
An accessory dwelling unit is permitted in any residential district or planned development district on each lot that has a single-family dwelling. [Ord. 17-1433 § 4 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 05-1257 § 4, 2005; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.105.]

18.50.310 Administrative review.
An application for an accessory dwelling unit meeting the following development standards shall be processed ministerially. In accordance with PMC 18.32.010(B), an accessory dwelling unit shall be approved if the unit complies with all of the following:

A. The unit is not intended for sale and may be rented;

B. The lot is zoned for single-family or multifamily residential use;

C. The lot contains a maximum of one single-family dwelling;

D. The dwelling conforms to the design and development standards for an accessory dwelling unit established in PMC 18.50.315;

E. The accessory unit structure is compatible with the design of the primary dwelling unit in terms of building materials, colors and exterior finishes and architectural style;

F. Public and utility services including emergency access are adequate to serve both dwellings;

G. The accessory dwelling unit complies with the development standards applicable to “single-family dwellings, detached,” within the residential or planned development district in which the primary dwelling is located, except as allowed by PMC 18.50.315. Accessory dwelling units proposed within RH or RHD districts shall comply with the development standards established for “single-family dwellings, detached,” within the RM district;

H. The primary dwelling and accessory dwelling unit shall not be occupied by two separate households under two separate leases. The primary dwelling and accessory dwelling unit built on the property shall be separately occupied only if the owner occupies one of the units. This rental restriction shall be recorded with the Contra Costa County recorder, on a form prepared by the city planner, and shall be a covenant running with the land. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued or no final inspection shall be conducted for the accessory dwelling unit unless the owner has submitted to the city planner a copy of the recorded restriction required by this subsection. Owner-occupancy shall not be required if the owner is a governmental agency, land trust, or housing organization;

I. The property owner must file an application with the planning division, which shall include:

1. Plans and elevations showing the proposed accessory dwelling unit and its relation to the primary dwelling, all existing or proposed structures on site, and all property lines;

2. Description of building materials;

3. Landscaping and exterior finish to be used;

4. Location of required parking pursuant to PMC 18.50.315;

5. Footprint (in square feet) of all existing and proposed structures, as well as the total lot coverage;

6. Any other information required to determine whether the proposed unit conforms to the requirements of this article;

J. The property owner must register the accessory dwelling unit with the city of Pittsburg residential rental inspection program. [Ord. 17-1433 § 4 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 05-1257 § 4, 2005; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.110.]

Article V. Home Occupations

18.50.400 Home occupation permit required.
A home occupation is permitted in an R district as an accessory use for a dwelling unit upon the issuance of a home occupation permit. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.200.]

18.50.405 Standards for home occupation permit.
A home occupation permit may be issued only if the use meets all of the following conditions:

A. The home occupation is not incompatible in any way with the residential character of the neighborhood;

B. There is no external evidence of its operation;

C. The use conforms to all of the following conditions:

1. Only a resident of the dwelling unit may be engaged or employed in the home occupation;

2. The primary function of the home occupation will not necessitate providing services to customers or clients within or on the site of the dwelling unit. An exception to this condition is the provision of an educational service and the supply of goods or materials to be used in conjunction with the educational service if the educational service does not create a neighborhood nuisance by the generation of noise or pedestrian or vehicular traffic beyond that normal for the area in which the use is located;

3. No goods, samples, materials or objects in connection with the operation of the home occupation may be stored or displayed on the site of the dwelling unit. This condition is not intended to prohibit the temporary interior storage of materials used in the operation of the home occupation; provided, that the storage complies with subsection (C)(5) of this section and does not create a health or safety problem or neighborhood nuisance;

4. No goods, products, or items may be maintained and sold from the dwelling as an activity of the home occupation, except as provided by subsection (C)(2) of this section. This does not include an activity regulated under the temporary use section of this title;

5. Not more than 20 percent of the total floor area of the dwelling or 10 percent of the site may be used in conjunction with the home occupation;

6. No sign, nameplate, or any other form of advertising used in connection with the home occupation may be displayed on the site;

7. No structure, addition, alteration or remodeling of the dwelling is permitted in connection with the home occupation;

8. Access to that portion of the dwelling used for the home occupation may only be through the main entrance to the dwelling unit;

9. One commercial motor vehicle, not exceeding a gross vehicle weight of 15,000 pounds, together with equipment, tools, and stock-in-trade may be maintained on the site provided such vehicle is used as the applicant’s means of transportation and such tools and equipment are not used for the performance of services on the site and stock-in-trade is not sold from the site;

10. No noise, dust, smoke, odor, nor electrical interference may be emitted in conjunction with the home occupation and the use must comply with the performance standards prescribed by Chapter 18.82 PMC.

The planning staff may refuse a home occupation permit even though the use may technically qualify with all these conditions if it finds that there is the possibility that the use may disrupt the residential neighborhood or that it is not in keeping with the intent and purpose of a home occupation. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.205.]

18.50.410 Zoning administrator approval.
If an application for a home occupation permit does not comply with every condition listed in PMC 18.50.405, or if the application is refused by the planning staff, the applicant may file for a zoning administrator approval under the provisions of PMC 18.32.010. The zoning administrator may issue a home occupation permit under the following provisions:

A. The zoning administrator must find that:

1. The establishment, maintenance or conduct of the home occupation, or the conditions under which the use will be conducted in this particular case, will not be detrimental to the health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience or welfare of persons residing or working in, or adjacent to, the neighborhood of such use, and will not, in this particular case, be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in such neighborhood;

2. The home occupation, in this case, will not be objectionable or undesirable because of potential noise, increased pedestrian or vehicular traffic, dust, smoke, odors, or any other condition which may interfere with the general welfare of the surrounding residential area; and

3. The establishment, maintenance, and conduct of the use generally complies with the intent of a home occupation as defined in this title.

B. In approving the home occupation permit, the zoning administrator may impose such conditions considered necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding area or neighborhood, in line with the standards prescribed in this section and with the general plan. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.210.]

18.50.415 Uses not permitted as home occupations.
The following occupations or activities and every similar use when conducted on a commercial basis and performed on the site of the applicant’s dwelling may not be considered a home occupation and therefore not permitted in an R district.

A. The repair, manufacture, processing, or alteration of goods, materials, objects, or equipment. However, dressmaking, tailoring and the manufacturing of arts and crafts items or the creation of artistic works, intended for off-site sale in which no equipment or process is used which creates an adverse impact on the neighborhood is permitted if the activity complies with PMC 18.50.405. This provision is also not intended to exclude the creation or processing of clerical, graphic, computer-generated, or administrative associate products;

B. A use involving food handling, processing, or packing;

C. Harboring, training, or raising animals, with the exception of the breeding and selling of no more than two litters or broods of domestic animals in any calendar year;

E. Sale or servicing of firearms or ammunition;

F. Automobile washing and detailing, including off-site mobile services. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.215.]

18.50.420 Multiple home occupations.
More than one home occupation may be located in a dwelling unit but each use is considered a separate business and must obtain a home occupation or zoning administrator approval. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.220.]

18.50.425 Cessation of use.
A permit granted under this article becomes null and void if either the use ceases for a period of six consecutive months or if the home occupation is no longer conducted by the applicant to which the permit was granted. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.225.]

18.50.430 Revocation of permit.
A permit granted under this article may be revoked by the zoning administrator by following the notice hearing and determination provisions of PMC 18.28.100 and 18.28.110 except that the zoning administrator rather than the planning commission shall hear and decide the matter. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990. Formerly 18.50.230.]

Article I. General

18.52.005 Specific purposes.
A. The specific purposes of commercial district regulations are to:

1. Provide appropriately located areas consistent with the general plan for a full range of office, retail, pedestrian commercial, and service uses needed and wanted by residents of, and visitors to, the city and region;

2. Strengthen the city’s economic base, and provide employment opportunities close to home for residents of the city and surrounding communities;

3. Create suitable environments for various types of commercial uses, and protect them from the adverse effects of inharmonious uses;

4. Minimize the impact of commercial development on adjacent residential districts;

5. Provide opportunities for institutional residential development on the site of commercial development or on separate sites in certain commercial districts;

6. Ensure the provision of sufficient off-street parking and loading facilities;

7. Provide sites for public and semipublic uses needed to complement commercial development or be compatible with a commercial environment.

B. The additional purposes of specific commercial districts are as follows:

1. Commercial Office (CO). To provide a landscaped environment for institutional, administrative, and professional office development of residential scale, including hospitals, related medical facilities and limited retail and commercial service uses, that are protected from the more intense levels of activity associated with community and neighborhood-serving, retail commercial development;

2. Neighborhood Commercial District (CN). To provide sites for businesses serving the daily needs of nearby residential areas while establishing development standards that complement the surrounding residential environment and that prevent significant adverse effects on adjoining residential uses;

3. Community Commercial District (CC). To provide for commercial centers and individual structures on sites that are located within reasonable distance of high densities of residences or that are served by local and regional transportation and transit systems. These sites typically host a wide variety of local- and regional-serving commercial establishments, including businesses selling home furnishings, apparel, durable goods, and specialty items. Support facilities such as personal services, entertainment, eating-and-drinking establishments and institutional uses are also allowed, subject to certain limitations to avoid adverse effects on adjacent uses;

4. Service Commercial District (CS). To provide opportunities for retail and service businesses on transitional sites between commercial and industrial areas, including businesses not allowed in other commercial districts because they have industrial characteristics, require heavy vehicle or truck traffic, or have certain other adverse impacts;

5. Downtown Service Commercial District (CSD). To provide opportunities for service commercial uses that require vehicle or truck traffic, including contractors, repair establishments and retail sales of durable goods, within the downtown but outside of the pedestrian commercial core. Development standards are created for the district that are unique to the downtown location of the district and that reflect the existing development pattern.

6. Waterfront Commercial District (CW). To provide opportunities for commercial development that enhances the city’s waterfront, that serves as an attraction for residents and visitors, and that incorporates services that are related to the waterfront. Guest-serving and pedestrian-oriented uses, including retail, restaurant, recreational and hotel facilities, are encouraged throughout the district. Offices, research and development, and marine service establishments such as boat repair and storage are also allowed, subject to limitations that ensure that such uses do not detract from the pedestrian space within the district;

7. Pedestrian Commercial District (CP). To provide a vibrant destination area that caters to pedestrian shoppers and visitors in the downtown commercial core. Permitted uses on ground floor along the primary corridor consist primarily of pedestrian-oriented retail, entertainment, restaurants, and galleries. Office uses are permitted above/below the ground floor and beyond the primary corridor of the CP district to increase the downtown population and employment/shopper base without detracting from the ground floor pedestrian retail synergy desired along the primary corridor. The district is intended to create a place for pedestrian-oriented activity by providing inviting, visually interesting, human-scale architecture, pedestrian-friendly storefronts, outdoor dining opportunities, and a limited number of (public) parking facilities. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 06-1273 § 4, 2006; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

3. Provide a suitable environment for various types of industrial uses, and protect them from the adverse impacts of inharmonious uses;

4. Ensure that the appearance and effects of industrial uses are compatible with the character of the area in which they are located;

5. Minimize the impact of industrial uses on adjacent residential districts;

6. Ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking and loading facilities.

B. The additional purposes of specific industrial districts are as follows:

1. Industrial Park District (IP). To provide sites in landscaped settings for service-oriented commercial and light industrial uses with limited customer presence and turnover, including industrial office centers, research and development facilities, limited industrial activities (including production and assembly but no raw materials processing or bulk handling), limited and warehouse type retail and commercial activities, and small-scale warehousing distribution.

2. Limited Industrial District (IL). To provide opportunities for service-oriented commercial and limited industrial uses in transitional areas between heavy industry and residential and commercial land uses. Heavy industrial uses are restricted or subject to discretionary approval in order to minimize their potential impacts on surrounding land uses.

3. General Industrial District (IG). To provide sites for intense industrial uses on large parcels occupied by or directly adjacent to existing heavy industrial uses, as well as on small parcels in the vicinity of heavy industrial uses. Areas are established for heavy industrial uses in order to protect them, to the extent feasible, from disruption and competition for space from unrelated retail and commercial uses that are more appropriately located elsewhere in the city. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

1. Credit for Preservation of Natural Features. In calculating the minimum percent of the site area to be landscaped, walks, creeks, riverfront, wetlands, adjacent riparian vegetation and slopes to be retained in their natural state qualify as planting areas.

2. Credit for Recreational Amenities. In calculating the total site landscaping percentage, the following outdoor active and passive recreational amenities shall qualify as landscaping when provided on-site and privately maintained. Pursuant to the limitations specified in PMC 18.54.010, recreational amenities provided under this subsection may require a use permit. Each one square foot of the following recreational amenities provided on-site shall be credited as one and one-half square feet toward the minimum site landscaping requirement for the site:

a. Paved patios or gardens; provided, that the patio or garden encompasses 200 or more square feet, incorporates at least one tree for shade, and incorporates fixed outdoor furniture at a ratio of no less than one seat and no more than two seats per 50 square feet of patio or garden area. Seating required under this provision may include benches, or may include individual chairs combined with tables, as for dining purposes;

b. Continuous trails of at least one-quarter mile in length. Trails less than one-quarter mile in length shall not qualify for the landscaping credit provided under this subsection, unless that portion of the trail that is provided on-site is connected to another paved trail on one or more abutting sites; and provided, that all legs of the trail are continuous and have a combined length of no less than one-half mile. As used in this subsection, “trail” shall mean a paved course, excluding a sidewalk or lane within a public right-of-way, that is intended for use by bicyclists or pedestrians, that is constructed of pervious material, that is at least six feet wide, and that is designed and constructed so as to comply with the minimum accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act;

c. Basketball courts and half-courts; recreational soccer fields with minimum dimensions of 50 feet by 100 feet; baseball and softball diamonds; horseshoe pits; volleyball, tennis, badminton and handball courts; lawn bowling greens; and similar athletic courts with associated sports equipment.

18.56.010 General.
A. The regulations in this chapter apply to all hillside development. Hillside development must also comply with all other applicable provisions of this title. Where this chapter conflicts with other provisions of this title, this chapter controls.

B. If land is zoned hillside planned development, but no hillside planned development permit is approved, no new use may be established. A single-family residential or agricultural building lawfully existing at the time of the establishment of hillside planned development zoning may be enlarged or structurally altered and a building may be constructed as permitted by this chapter.

C. To assist applicants in the early stages of project development, the community development department shall develop and maintain a general design guidelines document for the hillside planned development district. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.56.020 Intent and purpose.
A. The city is fortunate to be situated between two significant natural resources: The Suisun Bay to the north and the dramatic foothills of Mount Diablo to the south.

B. These foothills to the south are a natural topographic feature, visible to residents and to many visitors traveling State Route 4 and the waters of the Suisun Bay.

C. While development to date has not substantially impinged upon these hills, the city recognizes the need to enact hillside development regulations that will ensure that any future development within these hillside areas will be compatible with the special sensitivity of the hillside areas.

D. The city council declares that lands within the hillside areas be placed in a hillside planned development (HPD) district. The following goals are established for the HPD district:

1. To encourage and create the means of effectuating desirable future development through regulations and development standards on those lands designated in the city general plan as estate residential and hillside/grazing;

2. To protect the public health, safety and welfare in regard to hillside development;

3. To protect natural topographic features, aesthetic views, vistas and prominent ridgelines;

4. To protect adjacent properties from potential adverse impacts of grading and drainage associated with hillside development;

5. To encourage the use of development techniques and alternatives that will be compatible to the terrain of the hillside areas. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.56.030 Definitions.
In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:

“Agricultural buildings” means a structure, except fences, for the purpose of housing farm animals or farm equipment. It excludes a building used for processing or producing farm products on a commercial basis.

“Base density” means the number of dwellings per acre before adjustment.

“Contour interval” means the difference in elevation between adjacent contour lines on a topographic map.

“Development plan” reflects the developer’s intentions regarding the total development of a site.

“Hillside planned development zone (HPD)” means land zoned as hillside planned development.

“Interim use” means a use existing on July 4, 1984, for which a hillside development plan has not been approved.

“Major ridge” means a ridge designated to be preserved in its natural state and delineated on the hillside ridge preservation map.

“Minor ridge” means a ridge designated on the hillside ridge preservation map as “minor ridge” on which development may be permitted provided special design requirements are implemented.

“Open space” means an area to remain undeveloped and to be dedicated to the public or to be held in common ownership by the residents of a development.

“Original ground” means the condition of the existing terrain in its natural state before development.

“Ridge” means an interconnected series of major and minor hill tops.

“Ridgeline” means the highest elevation of a ridge running parallel with the long axis of the ridge.

“Transitional design” is a method of buffering and protecting residential land uses from the impacts associated with locating different types of land on contiguous property lines. [Amended during 2007 recodification; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.56.040 Permitted uses.
The following uses are permitted in the HPD zone:

18.56.090 Development standards.
A. Density.

1. Densities must be compatible with the existing topography and consistent with the goals and regulations of this chapter and the general plan.

2. In determining the actual density for a hillside development permit, the city must consider the following factors:

a. Housing type and variety;

b. Unit size;

c. Surface and coverage of units;

d. Percentage of open space;

e. Recreation space;

f. Preservation of ridgelines;

g. Environmental impacts.

3. The density in a hillside area may not exceed the density shown on the approved hillside development permit site plan.

4. Base Density.

a. The base density is determined in accordance with the average, natural ground slope of the land as provided by Table I as follows:

 

TABLE I

BASE DENSITY

Average Natural Ground Slope “S”

Base Density in Residential Units Per Gross Acre

Under 10%

4.5

10%

4.0

15%

3.5

20%

2.5

25%

2.0

30%

1.5

35%

1.0

40%

0.5

Over 40%

0.2

b. For average natural ground slopes between those provided, the base density is interpolated between those indicated in the table.

c. The average natural ground slope is “S” computed by the following formula:


 

Where:

I

=

Contour interval in feet

 

L

=

Summation of the length of all individual contours

 

A

=

Gross acreage of property in acres

d. The base densities in Table I are based on an average single-family ground level surface coverage, including garage, of 2,100 square feet per unit (measured in a horizontal plane).

e. When the proposed average ground level surface coverage of a development is less than or greater than the 2,100 square foot average, the base density from Table I is adjusted as follows:

2,100 sq. ft. × base density from Table I = Adjusted base density/Actual average level surface coverage per unit (including garage).

f. The total number of residential dwelling units permitted for a site is determined by multiplying the total acreage of the site times the base density in unit/per acre from Table I.

g. For nonresidential structures within a residential development, the equivalent number of dwelling units is determined by dividing the gross covered or uncovered ground level square footage, including parking areas and garages, by 2,100 square feet. The equivalent number of dwelling units for nonresidential structures is deducted from the total allowable residential units as calculated above.

h. For a nonresidential development, the base density from Table I is used in determining the maximum ground level gross building coverage, including parking areas. The maximum gross building coverage, including parking areas, is determined as follows:

Base density unit/ac × 2,100 sq. ft. × total acreage of site = Maximum total ground level building coverage (including parking areas).

5. Density Bonus.

a. The actual density of dwelling units that may be appropriate for a given site is dependent upon many interrelated factors such as housing type, design, size of units, amount of public and common open space, preservation of permanent ridgelines, grading, yards and street designs.

b. To encourage innovative development of hillside areas, consistent with the goals of this chapter, the city may approve an increase of the base density of up to 25 percent upon finding that the development will meet one or more of the following criteria (the maximum increase in density is shown in parentheses):

i. Ridgelines not indicated on hillside ridge preservation map will be preserved (five percent maximum);

ii. Twenty-five percent or more of the property is to remain common or public open space (five percent maximum);

iii. Twenty-five percent or more of the housing units will be designed to fit the natural terrain (five percent maximum);

iv. Substantial on-site or off-site improvements that will benefit the general public will be constructed by the developer at no expense to the city (five percent maximum);

v. Twenty-five percent or more of the total units of housing development provided for low- or moderate-income households or 10 percent of the total units are developed for lower-income households (25 percent maximum);

vi. Project design includes two or more land uses (five percent maximum);

vii. There is a major orientation of living spaces, balconies, and patios to views (five percent maximum);

viii. The project is designed for energy conservation over and above that required by the Uniform Building Code such as active and passive solar design, building orientation, landscaping and active solar systems for hot water, space heating and cooling (five percent maximum);

ix. Project design integrates pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian trails into overall circulation plan for hillside areas (five percent maximum).

B. Grading.

1. Grading of hillside areas must conform to other provisions of the municipal code, e.g., Chapter 15.88 PMC, in addition to this subsection.

2. Cut and fill slopes visible to the general public must be contour rounded to conform as nearly as possible to the existing ungraded natural terrain. Contouring must be approved by the city during each stage of development approval.

3. Grading must be designed to minimize cuts and fills and to retain the general character of the existing terrain.

4. Cuts and fills must be designed to balance as near as possible to avoid the nuisances created by off-site hauling. If off-site hauling is approved by the city, details of the hauling operation, including, but not limited to, size of trucks, haul route, dust and debris control measures, and time and frequency of haul trips must be submitted to the city engineer for approval. The city engineer may place restrictions considered necessary to minimize adverse impacts that may otherwise result from hauling.

5. Sediment basins may be required as necessary to detain runoff and trap sediment during construction until slope erosion planting is established. The sediment basin dam and collected silt must then be removed and the resulting material hauled from the site or used as a topsoil if suitable. Any silt deposit into off-site drainage facilities from the development must be removed as directed by the city.

6. Grading must be designed as far as possible so that lot lines are at the top of slope with adequate property line setback from the slope to provide for required vertical slope rounding.

7. Proposed slopes at the boundary must be designed wherever possible to be at the same elevation or below adjoining properties outside the development so as not to negate the privacy of adjoining property owners. If it is not possible and there are adjoining properties which will be adversely affected, the developer shall at the city’s option either move the slope onto the adjacent property owner’s land, replacing fences and improvements, or replace the property owner’s fence (if one exists) at the top of the slope and deed the slope to the property owner. This requirement does not apply if the adversely affected property owner refuses either option in writing.

8. Grading is not permitted outside the grading limits of the approved grading plan.

C. Lot Size, Yards and Building Heights.

1. The lot size, yard and building height shall be:

2. Minimum requirements are specified in Chart A, “Hillside Development Standards, Lot Size, Yards and Building Heights.”

D. Transitional Design Between Different Land Uses. Transitional design must be provided between varying land uses to buffer development from impacts associated with locating different types of land uses on contiguous property lines. In this situation, development must take place in accordance with the following standards:

1. A six-foot solid masonry or concrete wall or other appropriate barrier may be required along the adjoining property line. A higher wall may be required in high noise areas.

2. Interior and rear yards are set forth under subsection (C) of this section.

3. Landscaping Requirements.

a. A tree screen of a species acceptable to the planning commission planted at eight-foot intervals or other spacing approved by the planning commission. The planning commission shall specify the height of trees but in no case may the height be less than six feet when planted.

b. Tree wells must be placed at the end of parking aisle sections and at 45 feet on center spacing.

E. Landscaping.

1. Each development must include a combination of landscaping consisting of intensely planted and maintained areas and open space preserved in its natural condition.

2. Slopes adjacent to a collector or arterial street, except for front yards of residential units, must be completely landscaped and irrigated per a landscape plan approved by the director.

3. In a detached single-family residential subdivision, street trees must be planted along all streets at one per interior lot, two per corner lot, but not less than at 60-foot intervals. For all other development, street trees must be planted at a minimum of 30-foot intervals, and there must be at least 10 feet of landscaping between parking areas and public right-of-way.

4. A street tree must be not less than six feet in height as measured from ground surface after planting and must be a minimum of one inch in caliper as measured 30 inches above the base of the tree.

18.56.110 Ridge preservation.
A. General.

1. Each ridge delineated on the hillside ridge preservation map, on file in the community development department, designated as “major ridge” shall be preserved in its natural state. The city may require the preservation of other ridges, designated on the ridge preservation map as “minor ridges.”

2. Ridge preservation standards must be as provided in this section and as set forth by the hillside planned development permit.

B. Ridge Setbacks.

1. No development may occur within 100 feet of the center of a ridge to be preserved, unless the city council, upon recommendation of the planning commission, and finding that a reduced setback will not adversely affect the preservation of the ridge, approves such development.

2. The highest elevation of any element of a structure must be at least 25 feet below the elevation of the ridgeline as measured perpendicular to the ridgeline. The city council may approve a reduction of the 25-foot standard upon recommendation of the planning commission and finding that a reduction will not adversely affect the preservation of the ridge.

C. Precise Ridge Location. The location of ridges delineated on the hillside ridge preservation map are approximate only. The precise locations are as delineated on the city’s aerial topographic maps, on file in the community development department.

D. Permitted Uses.

1. Subject to approval of the city council, the following may be permitted on or over ridges designated to be preserved:

a. Public roads and facilities;

b. Hiking and equestrian trails;

c. Underground utilities.

2. The city may impose special conditions on the development to mitigate potential visual impacts.

E. Development of Minor Ridges. On the development of minor ridges not required to be preserved in their natural state, the city may impose special design and landscaping requirements as a condition of the hillside planned development permit. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.62.080    Review of plans.

18.62.010 Specific purposes.
The specific purpose of the planned development district (PD) is to:

A. Establish a procedure for the development of large parcels of land in order to reduce or eliminate the rigidity, delay, and inequity that otherwise would result from application of zoning standards and procedures designed primarily for small parcels;

B. Ensure orderly and thorough planning and review procedures that will result in quality urban design;

C. Encourage variety and avoid monotony in large developments by allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space and amenity;

D. Provide for flexibility, consistent with the general plan, from the rigid land use and development regulations found in base districts in order to take advantage of unique land use or site characteristics;

E. Encourage allocation and improvement of common open space in residential areas, and provide for maintenance of the open space at the expense of those who will directly benefit from it;

F. Encourage the preservation of serviceable existing structures of historic value or artistic merit by providing the opportunity to use them imaginatively for purposes other than that for which they were originally intended;

G. Encourage the assembly of properties that might otherwise be developed in unrelated increments to the detriment of surrounding neighborhoods. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.62.020 Applicability and zoning map designator.
An amendment to reclassify property to PD is initiated by a property owner, qualified applicant, the planning commission, or the city council. If the property is not under a single ownership, each owner must join in the application. A map showing the extent of ownerships must be submitted with the concept plans and materials. A PD district is indicated on the zoning map by the designation “PD” followed by the number of the enacting ordinance. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.62.030 Land use regulations.
No use other than an existing use is permitted in a PD district except in accord with a PD plan or specific plan. A permitted or conditional use authorized by this title or any other use found consistent with the intent of the general plan may be included in an approved PD plan or an adopted specific plan, consistent with the land use element of the general plan. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.62.040 Development regulations.
A. Minimum Area. The minimum area of a PD district should be four acres or more. However, a PD district may be subdivided in accord with a PD plan or specific plan. A district may be less than four acres upon a finding that there is unique character to the specific site, the proposed land use, or the existing or proposed improvements.

B. Residential Density. The total number of dwelling units in a PD plan may not exceed the number permitted by the general plan density for the total area of parcels designated for residential use and for open space. The density bonus provisions of Chapter 18.46 PMC apply.

C. Signs. The sign regulations prescribed by PMC Title 19 apply except as may be approved or modified by the PD plan.

D. Other Development Regulations. All other development regulations prescribed by this title apply except as may be approved or modified by the PD plan. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.62.050 Required plans and materials.
In addition to the plans and materials required to accompany an application for a zoning map amendment, an application for rezoning to a PD district must include a PD plan or specific plan incorporating such information, drawings, exhibits, reports, and supporting data necessary to describe the plan. The city planner may also require one or more of the following items, based on the type, location and potential impacts of proposed development:

A. A map showing the proposed district boundaries and the relationship of the district to uses and structures within a 300-foot radius of the district boundaries;

B. A map or aerial photo of the proposed district and 100 feet beyond its boundary showing sufficient topographic data to indicate clearly the character of the terrain; the type, location, and condition of mature trees and other natural vegetation; and the location of existing development.

C. A site plan indicating the existing and proposed uses, gross and net acreages, gross floor area, lot coverage, height, parking, residential densities and delineation of building footprints, lot patterns and configurations and circulation plan including existing and proposed streets, driveways and parking areas;

D. Architectural plan indicating exterior elevations, floor plans, and colors and materials of buildings and structures;

E. Landscape plan indicating existing vegetation and proposed planting areas, types and sizes of plant materials and design of walkways, trails, recreation areas, paved areas, benches, water features, and lighting, plus use of open space areas;

F. Guidelines for the physical development of the property, including illustrations of proposed architectural, urban design, and landscape concepts.

G. On slopes over 10 percent, single line sections showing the relationship of the building to the topography. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.62.060 Approval of a PD plan or specific plan.
A. General Procedures. A PD plan or specific plan shall be processed at the same time as consideration of the application for reclassification to a PD district. The planning commission may require either a PD plan or a specific plan. A recommendation of the commission to reclassify to a PD district must include a resolution either recommending city council approval of a PD plan or recommending a specific plan.

B. PD Plan Effective Date and Expiration. The city council shall approve or conditionally approve a PD plan at the same time that it adopts an ordinance establishing a PD district. A PD plan is effective on the same date as the ordinance creating the PD district for which it was approved. The city council may require that the PD plan expire after a specified period of time unless a building permit is issued and construction diligently pursued. An approved PD plan may specify a development staging or phasing program. Expiration of a PD plan voids the PD district and causes the property to revert to the zoning map designation preceding the amendment to the PD district.

C. Specific Plan Procedures. A specific plan adopted by resolution of the city council is administered as prescribed by the city council, consistent with Government Code Section 65450 et seq. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 05-1257 § 4, 2005; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.62.070 Amendments to adopted PD plan.
An amendment to an adopted PD plan is initiated in the same manner as an application for a zoning map amendment (Chapter 18.48 PMC). [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. D), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.62.080 Review of plans.
Each project requires design review (Chapter 18.36 PMC). The city shall not accept plans for a project in a PD district for design review (Chapter 18.36 PMC) unless the plans are substantially consistent with an approved PD plan or specific plan.

The purpose of the interim study overlay district (__-S) is to allow discretionary review of a development proposal where a change in zoning regulations is contemplated or under study. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.70.020 Applicability and zoning map designator.
The interim study overlay district (_-S) may be combined with a base district. It is initiated by the city council or planning commission or by a petition of a qualified applicant under the procedure for a zoning map amendment (Chapter 18.48 PMC). Before approving an amendment reclassifying land to an __-S district, the planning commission and city council must approve a study plan that identifies regulatory problems and states land use and development issues to be resolved for the area proposed for reclassification. Each __-S district is indicated on the zoning map by adding an “-S” designator to the base district designation followed by the number of the enacting ordinance. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.70.030 Land use regulations.
A. Use Permit Required. A use permit is required for establishment of a new or expanded use in an __-S district. A use permit may be approved for any use classification permitted or conditionally permitted in the base district with which the __-S district is combined.

B. Required Findings. In addition to the findings required for a use permit (Chapter 18.16 PMC) and findings required for a specific use classification, approval of a use permit in the __-S district requires a finding that the proposed use will not conflict with the land use and development policies established for the area at the time the __-S district is adopted. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.70.040 Development regulations.
The development regulations for the __-S district are specified by a use permit or are those of the base district with which the __-S district is combined. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.70.050 Expiration and renewal of __-S district ordinance.
An ordinance establishing an __-S district must contain a provision terminating the __-S designation not more than two years from its effective date. An ordinance establishing an __-S district may be amended, reenacted, or superseded by a zoning map amendment (Chapter 18.48 PMC). [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.70.060 Resubmittal of development proposals.
A use permit application that is denied or approved subject to conditions unacceptable to the applicant may be resubmitted after the effective date of the zoning map or regulation amendment superseding an __-S district designation, notwithstanding PMC 18.16.020. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

The density bonus provisions of Chapter 18.46 PMC apply.

B. Property Development Regulations. Unless specifically indicated on an approved master plan or modified by another overlay district, the property development regulations, including minimum lot size, lot width, yards, and maximum building height, are those of the base district with which a __-P district is combined.

C. Other Development Regulations. Except as may be approved or modified by an approved master plan or another overlay district, all other development regulations are prescribed by this title. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.72.050 Initiation of master plan.
A qualified applicant may initiate an application to approve a master plan. If the property is not under a single ownership, every qualified applicant must join the application and file a map showing the extent of ownerships. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.72.060 Required plans and materials.
A. Each master plan for a specific area of land must include a land use and circulation system concept that is consistent with the goals and policies of the general plan, compatible with the environment, and capable of being served by existing and planned public facilities and utilities.

B. The following plans and materials must be submitted unless the city planner waives submission of items considered unnecessary:

1. A map showing proposed master plan boundaries and the relationship of the area to uses and structures within a 300-foot radius of the plan area boundaries;

2. A map of the master plan area showing sufficient topographical data to indicate clearly the character of the terrain, and the type, location, and condition of mature trees and other natural vegetation;

3. A site plan indicating the existing and proposed uses, gross floor area, lot coverage, height, parking and density, and a circulation plan;

4. Architectural plan indicating exterior elevations, floor plans, and colors and materials of buildings and structures;

5. Landscape plan indicating existing vegetation and proposed planting areas, types and sizes of plant materials, and design of walkways, trails, bicycle paths, recreation areas, paved areas, benches, water features, and lighting;

6. A preliminary development schedule indicating sequence and timing of development;

7. Guidelines for the physical development of the property, including illustrations of proposed architectural, urban design, and landscape concepts;

8. On slopes over 10 percent, single line sections showing the relationship of the building to the topography. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.72.070 Approval of master plan.
A. General Procedures. An application for approval of a master plan is processed as a zoning map amendment (Chapter 18.48 PMC).

B. Required Findings. The planning commission and the city council must find that the proposed master plan:

1. Conforms to the general plan;

2. Generally complies with the land use and development regulations of the base zoning district and does not significantly alter the regulations; and

3. Can be adequately, reasonably and conveniently served by public services, utilities and public facilities.

C. Amended Zoning Map Designator. The adopted master plan is indicated on the zoning map by adding the enacting ordinance number to the “-P” designator. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.72.080 Expiration of adopted master plan.
A. Expiration. A master plan expires after an amount of time specified by condition of approval, unless a building permit is issued for a structure within the master plan area and construction diligently pursued. In the absence of such a condition of approval, the master plan shall expire on the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the ordinance establishing the master plan overlay district, unless a building permit is issued for a structure within the master plan area and construction is diligently pursued. An approved master plan may specify adherence to a development staging or phasing program.

B. Zoning Map Designator. Expiration of a master plan causes removal of the enacting ordinance number from the “-P” designator on the zoning map. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. E), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.72.090 Amendments to adopted master plan.

NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
Sections:

18.76.010    Purpose.

18.76.020    Continuation and maintenance.

18.76.030    Alterations and enlargements of nonconforming uses and structures.

18.76.040    Cessation and abandonment of nonconforming use.

18.76.060    New occupancy on a site having certain nonconforming site features.

18.76.070    Zoning permits on sites having nonconforming features in the CP district.

18.76.010 Purpose.
This chapter is intended to limit the number and extent of nonconforming uses by limiting their enlargement, their reestablishment after abandonment, and the alteration or restoration after destruction of the structures they occupy. While permitting the use and maintenance of nonconforming structures, this chapter is intended to limit the number and extent of nonconforming structures by limiting their being moved, altered or enlarged in a manner that would increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and the standards prescribed in this title and by prohibiting their restoration after destruction. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 06-1273 § 4, 2006; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.76.020 Continuation and maintenance.
A. A use, lawfully occupying a structure or a site on June 20, 2007, that does not conform with the regulations applicable for the district in which the use is located is a nonconforming use and may be continued, except as provided in this chapter.

B. A structure, lawfully occupying a site on June 20, 2007, that does not conform with the standards for front yards, side yards, rear yards, height, or floor area of structures, driveways, courts, or open space for the district in which the structure is located is a nonconforming structure and may be used and maintained, except as provided in this chapter.

C. A use that does not conform with the planting area regulations of the district in which it is located is not a nonconforming use solely because of this nonconformity.

D. Routine maintenance and repairs may be performed on a nonconforming structure and on a structure, the use of which is nonconforming.

E. A use, lawfully occupying a structure or site in the CP district prior to November 1, 2006, that does not conform with the regulations applicable to the CP district, is a nonconforming use and may be continued, except as provided in this chapter.

F. A structure or site lawfully existing in the CP district prior to November 1, 2006, that does not meet the development standards for the CP district, or that does not conform to the Old Town Pittsburg Design Guidelines, is a nonconforming structure or site and may be maintained, except as provided in this chapter. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 06-1273 § 4, 2006; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.76.030 Alterations and enlargements of nonconforming uses and structures.
A. No structure, the use of which is nonconforming, may be moved or enlarged in violation of this chapter, unless the moving or enlargement is required by law or will result in the elimination of the nonconformity.

B. Exterior or interior remodeling of, or additions or improvements to, a structure located in an R or C district and housing a nonconforming residential use other than mixed use residential may be allowed without elimination of the nonconformity. The structure may be altered or enlarged in accordance with the development regulations of the applicable zoning district; provided, that the number of dwelling units is not increased.

C. A single-tenant structure housing a nonconforming use that is a use other than residential may be altered only to the extent of exterior or interior remodeling upon a finding by the zoning administrator that the alteration proposed (a) does not otherwise violate this chapter and (b) will not substantially extend the life of the nonconforming use in a manner that defeats the purpose of this chapter.

D. A multi-tenant structure partially occupied by a nonconforming use may not be moved or enlarged in such a way as to permit the enlargement of the space occupied by a nonconforming use. Interior remodeling or improvements to accommodate expansion of the nonconforming use within the exterior walls of the existing multi-tenant structure are permitted; provided, that the expansion of the nonconforming use into adjacent tenant spaces:

1. Does not increase the number of dwelling units within the building; or

2. Does not result in displacement of any conforming use or uses within the same building; or

3. Does not result in expansion of the nonconforming use into any vacant tenant space previously occupied by a conforming use.

E. Except as provided by subsections (B) and (D) of this section, a nonconforming use may not be enlarged or extended so as to occupy a part of the structure or site, or another structure or site, that it did not occupy on June 20, 2007, or in such a way as to displace a conforming use occupying a structure or site.

F. A nonconforming structure may not be altered or reconstructed so as to increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and the standards for front yard, side yard, rear yard, height of structure, distance between structures, driveway, court, or usable open space prescribed in the regulations for the district in which the structure is located. A nonconforming structure may not be moved or enlarged unless the new location or enlargement conforms to the standards for front yard, side yard, rear yard, height of structure, basic floor area, distance between structure, driveway, court, or usable open space prescribed in the regulations for the district in which the structure is located.

G. A use that fails to meet the performance standards of Chapter 18.80 PMC may not be enlarged or extended and may not have equipment replaced that results in failure to meet required conditions unless the enlargement, extension, or replacement will result in elimination of the nonconformity with required conditions. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 06-1273 § 4, 2006; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.76.040 Cessation and abandonment of nonconforming use.
A. No nonconforming use that is abandoned or discontinued may be reestablished except in accordance with this section. For purposes of this section, “abandoned” or “discontinued” shall mean cessation of a use for a continuous period of nine or more months, regardless of intent to resume the use.

B. A nonconforming use that is ceased but that is not abandoned or discontinued may be resumed within nine months after the date of cessation of the use. The nonconforming use of the structure or site may not be changed to another nonconforming use, unless the city planner determines that:

1. The substitute nonconforming use and the nonconforming use it would replace are categorized under the same land use classification; and

2. The substitute nonconforming use, when compared against the nonconforming use it would replace, is similar in nature and would operate in substantially the same manner or in a manner that is more consistent with other uses permitted in the district in which the property is located; and

3. The substitute nonconforming use would not operate in violation of any use permit conditions applicable to the site or structure.

C. A nonconforming use that is ceased but not abandoned, and that was legally established under a use permit required by a prior ordinance, may not be reestablished except in accordance with PMC 18.28.090.

D. Abandonment of Nonconforming Use in the M District and in the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan PD District. Upon approval by the zoning administrator, a nonconforming use that is abandoned or discontinued from a structure located in the M district or the Railroad Avenue specific plan PD district may be reestablished in that existing structure; provided, that a certificate of occupancy for the structure was issued prior to June 20, 2007.

1. For purposes of this subsection, nonconforming use shall include all establishments classified under the same land use classification, except as may be limited by a use permit.

2. For purposes of this subsection, a nonconforming use within a multitenant building is considered to be abandoned or discontinued when the nonconforming use no longer occupies any of the units within the multitenant building.

3. Findings. In considering the reestablishment of a nonconforming use pursuant to this section, the zoning administrator may approve the use only after determining that the proposed use:

a. Will occupy an existing structure that, based on the architecture and design of the structure, could not appropriately accommodate a conforming use without significant remodeling of the structure;

b. Is not a detriment to the health, safety and general welfare of the city;

c. Will not adversely affect the orderly development of property within the city;

d. Will not create a nuisance or enforcement problem within the neighborhood;

e. Will not encourage marginal development within the neighborhood; and

f. Will not adversely affect the preservation of property values and the protection of the tax base and other substantial revenue sources within the city.

E. Abandonment of a Nonconforming Use in Districts Other Than the M District. A nonconforming use that is abandoned or discontinued may not be reestablished. The use of the structure and site thereafter must conform with the regulations for the district in which the structure and site are located.

F. Notwithstanding subsections (B), (C), (D) and (E) of this section, a nonconforming site, structure, or portion of a site or structure that is then occupied by a conforming use for a continuous period of six or more months may not be reoccupied by a nonconforming use. [Ord. 10-1327 § 3 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 09-1319 § 3(3)(A), 2009; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 06-1273 § 4, 2006; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.76.050 Restoration of a damaged structure.
A. If a nonconforming structure or a structure that contains a nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or other calamity, by act of God, or by the public enemy to the extent of 50 percent or less, the structure may be restored and the nonconforming use may be resumed if a building permit for the restoration is issued within nine months after the event and the restoration is diligently pursued to completion.

B. A nonconforming structure or a structure that contains a nonconforming use, that is destroyed by fire or other calamity, by act of God, or by the public enemy to the extent of more than 50 percent, may only be restored in accordance with the applicable land use and development regulations within which the site and structure are located.

C. The determination of the damage or partial destruction under subsections (A) and (B) of this section shall be based on the ratio of the estimated cost of restoring the structure to its condition before the damage or partial destruction to the fair market value of the structure prior to the damage or partial destruction. The land value shall not be included as part of determining the fair market value of the structure. The appraisal for this purpose shall be performed by a licensed California State real estate appraiser who holds a certified general license. The cost of the appraisal shall be the sole responsibility of the property owner. The appraisal shall be submitted to the chief building official. The final determination as to the damage shall be the responsibility of the chief building official, which may or may not align with the appraisal.

D. Upon showing of sufficient evidence of progress to restore a damaged nonconforming structure as allowed by subsection (A) of this section, a property owner or designated applicant may request that the city planner extend the time permitted to obtain a building permit to restore the damaged structure. The extension of time approved by the city planner shall not exceed three months beyond the nine months allowed by subsection (A) of this section.

E. If a nonconforming structure or a structure that contains a nonconforming use destroyed by fire is voluntarily razed or is required by law to be razed, the structure may not be restored except in full conformity with the regulations for the district in which it is located. [Ord. 09-1316 § 2, 2009; Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 06-1273 § 4, 2006; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.76.060 New occupancy on a site having certain nonconforming site features.
An applicant for a zoning permit in a C or I district for occupancy of a site or structure that is nonconforming due to lack of screening of mechanical equipment, required walls or fences to screen parking, required paving for driveways, or required planting areas must present a schedule for elimination or substantial reduction of these nonconformities over a period not exceeding two years. The city planner may require that priority be given to elimination of nonconformities that have significant adverse impacts on surrounding properties over a commitment to remove nonconformities that have minor impact and would be costly to eliminate due to the configuration of the site and the location of existing structures. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 06-1273 § 4, 2006; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.76.070 Zoning permits on sites having nonconforming features in the CP district.
An applicant for a zoning permit (PMC 18.32.010(B)(2)) in the CP district at a site that does not substantially conform to any subsection of the Old Town Pittsburg Design Guidelines or that does not conform to any applicable section of this title shall present a “schedule for elimination or substantial reduction of nonconformities” to bring the site into substantial conformance over a period not exceeding two years. Extensions beyond two years may be granted for projects involving major exterior renovations. The proposed “schedule” shall be reviewed and processed pursuant to Chapter 18.36 PMC, Design Review. The applicant must obtain design review approval for their “schedule” and all the design proposals included therein, prior to issuance of a zoning permit under PMC 18.32.010(B)(2). For purposes of this section, “new or expanded use” as stated in PMC 18.32.010(A) is defined as a new or expanded business, rather than a new use classification. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 06-1273 § 4, 2006.]

18.78.010 Specific purposes.
The purpose of the off-street parking and loading regulations is to:

A. Ensure that off-street parking and loading facilities are provided for new land uses and for major alterations and enlargements of existing uses in proportion to the need for such facilities created by each use;

B. Establish parking standards for land uses consistent with need and with the feasibility of providing parking on specific land sites;

C. Ensure that off-street parking and loading facilities are designed in a manner that will ensure efficiency, protect the public safety, and, where appropriate, insulate surrounding land uses from adverse impacts. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.78.020 Applicability.
The regulations of this chapter apply to each zoning district established by this title except as may be modified by a PD or overlay zone. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.78.030 Basic requirements.
A. When Required. Off-street parking facilities and off-street loading facilities must be provided in accord with the regulations prescribed in this chapter at the time of either:

1. Initial occupancy by a use of an undeveloped site;

2. Construction of a structure;

3. Change in use classification of a building or site which creates an increase in the number of required parking spaces or loading berths;

4. Addition to, or enlargement of, an existing building or use.

B. Retention of Existing Parking or Loading. An existing use of land or structure is not considered nonconforming solely because of the lack of off-street parking or loading facilities required by this chapter. A facility being used for off-street parking and loading on March 19, 1990, may not be reduced in number to less than that required by this chapter, nor may the building be altered in design or function to less than the minimum standards required by this chapter for the duration of that use, unless a substitute facility is provided as prescribed by the regulations of this chapter.

C. Alterations or Enlargements. The number of parking spaces or loading berths required on the site of an addition, new structure, enlargement of a use by the alteration of existing structure, or for a change in use classification that would increase the number of spaces required, is only the number of spaces required for such structure, addition, enlargement, or difference in requirement of the new use and that required of the previous use as prescribed by this chapter, and not for the entire building or use. These provisions do not apply to an addition to a residential use that does not create additional dwelling units, nor to a nonresidential addition, structure, enlargement, or change of use that would increase the number of parking spaces by not more than five percent of the total number required before the alteration or enlargement.

D. Excess On-Site Parking or Loading. Where the number of parking spaces or loading berths on a site exceeds the number prescribed in this chapter for an existing use, the excess spaces or berths may be counted in determining the required number of spaces or berths for an expanded use on the site or towards the requirement for another use.

E. Sites with Multiple Uses.

1. Parking Spaces Required. If more than one use is located on a site other than as may be prescribed for a particular use classification the number of off-street parking spaces required is the sum of the requirements prescribed for each use, except as provided in subsection (E)(3) of this section.

2. Joint Use. An off-street parking facility required by this chapter for one use may not provide parking spaces for any other use except where subsection (D) of this section applies or a joint facility exists. A joint facility must contain not less than the total number of spaces as determined individually, or as required by subsection (E)(3) of this section. However, fewer spaces may be permitted where adjoining uses on the same site have different hours of operation and the same parking spaces can serve both without conflict. In order to allow fewer spaces than prescribed, the planning commission must make findings to determine the extent, if any, to which joint use will achieve the purpose of this chapter.

3. Shopping Center Parking Requirement. The parking standards prescribed for retail sales are used to determine the number of off-street parking spaces required for all use classifications that are permitted when located within a shopping center by using the aggregate gross floor area of all such uses. Any use classification that requires a use permit or is on a separate parcel within a shopping center site must provide parking as required for that individual use, except as may be modified by the provisions of subsection (E)(2) or (F) of this section.

4. Loading Facilities. If the gross floor area of an individual use on the same site is less than that for which a loading berth would be required by Schedule B of PMC 18.78.040, but the aggregate gross floor area of all uses is greater than the minimum for which loading berths would be required, the aggregate gross floor area is used in determining the required number of loading berths.

Off-street loading facility requirements of this chapter may be satisfied by the permanent allocation of the prescribed number of berths for each use in a common truck loading facility. The total number of berths may not be less than the sum of the individual requirements.

F. Location and Ownership.

1. R Districts. Required parking for a residential use in an R district must be on the same site as the use served. Additional parking may be provided on another site or within a nonresidential zoning district. Off-site parking for a nonresidential use in an R district is not permitted unless the nonresidential use served is permitted or conditionally permitted in the R district where the off-site facility is proposed to be located.

2. Nonresidential Districts. Parking required to serve a nonresidential use may be on the same or a different site under the same or different ownership as the use served so long as that parking is within 200 feet of the use served, measured from the near corner of the parking facility to the entrance of the use served via the shortest pedestrian route.

The facility for off-site parking must be restricted to that use by a recorded deed, lease, or agreement for a minimum period of 10 years from the date a zoning permit requiring the parking is issued. No use may be continued if the parking is removed unless a substitute parking facility is provided.

G. Reserved Parking Spaces. Required parking spaces may be reserved for the exclusive use of an individual tenant or use as follows:

1. Multifamily Residential Uses. No more than one space per dwelling unit in a multifamily dwelling containing more than four units.

2. Nonresidential Uses. No more than the minimum number of spaces required for the area occupied by an individual nonresidential tenant or use located in a joint facility.

Sites providing parking spaces in addition to the minimum required for the use or uses may assign exclusive use to individual tenants or uses for such additional parking.

H. Use of Parking Facilities.

1. Required parking spaces, as prescribed by this chapter, may be used only for the temporary parking of vehicles of the residents, guests, employees, customers, or other legitimate visitors of the site.

2. No sales, storage, repair, dismantling, or servicing of any kind is permitted in any required parking space, aisle, or driveway, except as allowed in a residential district pursuant to PMC 18.50.200 through 18.50.210.

3. Use of parking facilities not otherwise required is allowed only as provided in this chapter.

4. A vehicle parked in a required parking space must be operable and registered.

5. Automobiles may be continuously parked in a required space no more than five consecutive days, unless it is a reserved space prescribed by subsection (G) of this section, or is for a single-family dwelling or duplex.

6. No overnight parking is allowed for recreation vehicles, trucks, or other equipment, unless specifically permitted by other provisions of this title.

7. No overnight habitation within an automobile is allowed. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.78.040 Off-street parking and loading spaces required by type of use.
A. Parking Spaces Required. Independently accessible off-street parking spaces must be provided in accord with Schedule A as set out in this section.

B. Loading Berths Required. Independently accessible off-street loading berths must be provided in accord with Schedule B as set out in this section. The reference in Schedule A to group number for off-street loading is to the group number in Schedule B, which sets space requirements for different groups of use classifications and sizes of buildings.

C. Computation of Spaces Required. If, in applying the requirements of this chapter, a fractional number is obtained, one parking space or loading berth is required for a fraction of one-half or more. A space or berth is not required for a fraction of less than one-half.

D. Square Foot References. The references to spaces per square foot are to be computed on the basis of gross floor area as defined by this title, unless otherwise specified.

E. Seat Equivalency. Use classifications requiring parking based on the number of seats are to use only such tables, chairs, booths, stools, pews, or benches that are attached or specifically designed for a particular situation. Where such seating is not fixed or is readily movable, seating for dining purposes is considered to occupy 15 square feet of floor area per seat, and seating for assembly or classroom purposes is considered to occupy seven square feet of floor area per seat. A pew or bench seat is considered to be 24 inches in width for the purposes of this chapter. Seating area, as used in this chapter, is considered to be all that area planned for or that may be used for seating, exclusive of any necessary peripheral or emergency access aisles.

F. Uses Not Specified. If a use permit is required to establish a use, and the use classification is not included in Schedule A, the planning commission or zoning administrator, as appropriate, shall determine the required number of parking or loading spaces for the use in conjunction with the commission’s or zoning administrator’s review of the use permit. If the use is a permitted use, and the use classification is not included in Schedule A, the zoning administrator or the planning commission, as appropriate, shall determine the parking and loading requirements as part of the zoning approval process (Chapter 18.32 PMC).

G. Exceptions for Downtown and Residential Infill Units. Any proposed use and/or application for development activity on property located near transit or within the downtown subarea of the general plan shall be subject to the minimum off-street parking and loading spaces required by this section, with the following exceptions:

1. Residential Units Near Transit. The developer of residential units on an infill site located within one-quarter mile of bus, rail, shuttle or other mass transit station or facility may request a reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required for the use. The residential units may be multifamily residential units, single-family residential units constructed on lots with a maximum lot size of 4,500 square feet, or a combination of the two. The zoning administrator or the planning commission, as appropriate, may not approve the request for reduced off-street parking unless it finds that the requested reduction in off-street parking is equivalent to the reduced demand for on-site parking as a result of the site’s proximity to transit.

2. Multifamily Residential Units within the Downtown Subarea of the General Plan. The off-street parking requirement for multifamily residential projects in the downtown subarea of the general plan shall be one and one-half parking spaces per unit. The developer of multifamily residential units in the downtown subarea of the general plan may request a reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required for the multifamily residential use. The zoning administrator or the planning commission, as appropriate, may not approve the request for reduced off-street parking unless it finds that the proposed parking ratio will not negatively impact the parking facilities in the area, or, for existing buildings, that the provision of parking in accordance with this title would result in undue hardship in the improvement of the property and would result in an inconsistency with adopted design review guidelines in support of pedestrian-oriented storefronts.

3. Nonresidential Uses in the CP District. Nonresidential uses on properties located in the CP district shall not be subject to the minimum off-street parking and loading spaces required by this section.

4. Railroad Avenue Specific Plan and Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Master Plan. Vehicular and bicycle parking requirements for development located within the Railroad Avenue specific plan or the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART master plan area shall be those of the applicable specific plan or master plan.

18.78.050 Parking facility design standards.
A. Parking Space Dimensions. The minimum dimensions of each required automobile parking space are as follows:

Use

Type of Space

Width and Length (Ft.)

Residential

In a separate garage or carport housing 4 or fewer cars, or with a door at the rear of each space

10 × 20

Residential

In a garage or carport housing more than 4 cars with access via an aisle or an uncovered space

9 × 18

Nonresidential

All nonparallel spaces

9 × 18

All

Parallel spaces

8 × 22

1. Increased Space Width Requirements. Each uncovered parking space adjoining a wall, column, or other obstruction higher than one-half foot and more than six feet from the front of the space must be increased in width one foot on each unobstructed side.

2. Vertical Clearance. Vertical clearance for each parking space must be at least seven feet, except that an entrance may be 6.67 feet and the front five feet of a parking space serving a residential use may be four and one-half feet.

3. Wheel Stops. Each parking space must have the centerline of a wheel stop at least two and one-half feet from any fence or wall. When a parking space abuts a landscaped planter, the front two feet of the required length for a parking space may overhang the planter, including the curb. When a parking space abuts a walkway, the front two feet of the required length of a parking space may overhang the walkway, including the curb, if the walkway is at least seven feet wide; otherwise the full length must be provided and a wheel stop installed two feet from the walkway.

4. Carport Dimensions. A carport roof must completely cover a required covered parking space and provide a minimum vertical clearance as prescribed in subsection (A)(2) of this section with a maximum clearance of 10 feet.

5. Parking Space Location. A paved parking space serving a single-family dwelling may not be located in that portion of a front or corner side yard which is more than a distance equal to one-half of the lot width or, in the case of a corner lot, the lot depth measured from the interior lot line. This does not pertain to a flag lot or lot described in PMC 18.80.050.

6. Parking Space Length Reduction. Nonresidential buildings over 50,000 square feet or nonresidential buildings totaling over 50,000 square feet on a site may have up to 20 percent of the required parking spaces reduced to 15 feet in length where the front two feet of the standard space is either a landscaped area or light standard.

B. Aisle Dimensions. The minimum aisle widths adjoining parking spaces are as follows:

Minimum Aisle Width for Specified Angle (Ft.)

Angle with Parking Space

One-Way Traffic

Two-Way Traffic

Depth of Space (Ft.) Perpendicular to Aisle

Article I. Accessory Structures

18.84.005 In R districts.
A. Timing. A nonresidential accessory structure may not be established or constructed before the start of construction of the principal structure on a site. A construction or real estate sales construction trailer is permitted on a site at the time the site clearance and grading begins.

B. Location – General. An accessory structure, other than an accessory dwelling unit, may occupy any portion of the lot where a main building is permitted. Except as provided in this subsection, a nonresidential accessory structure may not occupy a required yard or, other than a garage or carport, be placed beyond the front building line of a main structure on a site.

C. Rear Yard, Placement and Height. A nonresidential accessory structure may be located within a required rear yard providing the maximum height does not exceed 10 feet; however, no portion of a roof having a pitch of 3:12 or greater may exceed 12 feet.

D. Size. The total gross floor area of all nonresidential accessory structures more than four feet in height may not exceed 800 square feet or six percent of the lot area, whichever is more. The gross floor area is included in computing lot coverage.

E. Distance Between Structures. An accessory structure must be at least five feet from the wall of a main building.

F. Equipment Shed. A structure housing equipment may be placed in a required side or rear yard where an accessory building is not permitted under the following provisions:

1. There is a solid fence between the structure and the adjoining property;

2. The structure does not exceed the height of the fence or six and one-half feet, whichever is less;

3. There is a clear passageway not less than three feet in width either between the structure and an adjacent structure or between the structure and the adjacent fence; and

4. The total surface area of all such structures does not exceed 50 square feet. [Ord. 17-1433 § 4 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 05-1257 § 4, 2005; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

Article II. Amateur Radio Antenna Systems

18.84.020 General.
A. This article regulates the installation of amateur radio antenna systems in all zoning districts within the city.

B. This article applies to every antenna system mounted on a building or other permanent fixture and to every ground-mounted antenna system.

C. This article does not apply to an antenna system established as emergency communication system for publicly owned facility.

D. This article does not authorize the installation of an amateur radio system on property for which the installation of such antenna system is restricted by private agreement including but not limited to deed, lease, restriction, covenant and condition, or by-laws of a private association. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.84.025 Legislative findings and declaration.
The city council finds that amateur radio facilities provide a voluntary, noncommercial communications service of particular value to the community in providing emergency communications. The city council further finds that the installation of amateur radio antenna systems, unless regulated, can adversely affect the safety and aesthetic values of agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial areas. The intent of this chapter is to regulate the installation of amateur radio antenna systems in order to ensure maximum safety to the public and adjacent property owners, to minimize visual impacts of the antenna systems on public rights-of-way and adjacent properties, and to accommodate the reasonable requirements of amateur radio operators within the city. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.84.030 Standards for all radio antenna systems.
Every amateur radio antenna system installed in the city must comply with the following requirements and standards:

A. The property owner must file an application for a building permit for the antenna system in a form and manner prescribed by the building division. The application must include:

1. A plot plan showing the location of the antenna system, property and setback lines and all structures existing on the property;

2. The manufacturer’s specifications, if any, for the antenna system and the details of footings, guys and braces proposed for the antenna support structure; and

3. A set of engineered plans for the antenna system with the original signature of a certified engineer. The building official will determine whether or not plans are required. The plans must comply with the manufacturer’s specifications and with any other safety standards established by the building division.

The applicant must pay the required building permit fee.

B. An antenna system may not have a highly reflective surface. Its colors must be subdued.

C. No more than one antenna support structure is allowed on a parcel. This limitation includes a satellite antenna and microwave equipment regulated under PMC 18.84.600 through 18.84.640.

D. A ground-mounted antenna system may be erected only in a rear yard or interior side yard. No portion of an antenna system may extend into a front yard or street side yard. Guy wires may not be anchored within any front yard area or street side yard. Guy wires may be attached to a building on the property.

E. A setback of at least 20 percent of the height of the antenna system support structure is required between the property lines and any portion of the support structure. In addition, no portion of an antenna system may extend into any other setback required by this code nor be closer than five feet from any property line.

F. An antenna system must be maintained with no structural defects or visible damage.

G. A ground-mounted antenna system must be surrounded by a security barrier contiguous to the support structure and sufficient to prevent an unauthorized person from climbing the antenna support structure.

H. An antenna system whose antenna height exceeds 35 feet must have a collapsible antenna support structure such that when collapsed, the antenna system does not exceed 35 feet in height. When not in use, a collapsible antenna system must be collapsed to a height not exceeding 35 feet. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.84.035 Permit requirement.
A. In addition to the requirements of this section, a ground-mounted antenna system may not be erected without a use permit from the planning commission.

B. An application for a use permit must be made on a form prescribed by the planning director and be accompanied by the following:

1. An approved application for a building permit required by PMC 18.84.030(A);

2. A site plan showing adjacent properties and proposed screening structures or landscaping; and

3. A fee in the amount established by city council resolution.

C. To grant a use permit, the planning commission must determine that the antenna system as proposed meets the standards required under PMC 18.84.030 and may also impose conditions that:

1. Fix the location of the antenna system on the parcel;

2. Limit the maximum height of the antenna;

3. Require landscaping or other screening to minimize the visual impact of the antenna system on surrounding properties and public rights-of-way; and

4. The planning commission consider necessary or appropriate to enable it to make the findings required by subsection (D) of this section.

D. In granting the use permit, the planning commission must first find that the establishment of the antenna system as condition by the use permit:

1. Will not be detrimental to the health and safety of persons residing and working in the neighborhood;

2. Will not be detrimental to property or improvements in the neighborhood;

3. Will have a minimum visual impact on the surrounding neighborhood and public rights-of-way; and

4. Will reasonably accommodate the needs of amateur radio communications.

E. The decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council by the applicant or other affected person.

F. Approval of a use permit for a radio antenna system expires six months after the effective date of approval unless the antenna system is placed or construction is underway and diligently pursued before the expiration of the six-month period. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.84.040 Special exception to use permit requirement.
A. This chapter is enacted based upon existing technology and the prevailing form and mass of radio antenna systems. The city council recognizes that modern technology has the capability of changing rapidly and that radio antenna systems may be devised or developed which provide the same capabilities but comprise a form and mass which do not have the same physical characteristics or visual qualities as those existing. The purpose of this section is to provide an administrative procedure which balances the interests of amateur radio operators with those of surrounding property owners in the face of radio antenna systems which have visual qualities different from those contemplated or which prevailed at the time the chapter is adopted.

B. A person seeking approval to install an antenna system may request an exception from the use permit requirement of PMC 18.84.030 by complying with the following requirements:

1. File the application required by PMC 18.84.035;

2. Submit a statement justifying an exception from the use permit requirement of PMC 18.84.030 by showing that the form and mass of the proposed antenna system is such that it meets the findings set forth in PMC 18.84.030(D) without the need of having to comply with specially imposed conditions;

3. Submit a supportive petition or consent form from property owners in the surrounding affected area.

C. The planning director may either grant or deny the special exception or grant it with conditions. If the planning director determines that the request may be controversial or is in doubt as to whether it qualifies for treatment as a special exception he may refer it to the planning commission for decision.

D. The planning commission either grants or denies the special exception or grants it with conditions. A person affected by the decision may appeal it to the city council. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.84.045 Enforcement.
A. A person who violates this chapter is guilty of an infraction and shall be punished as provided in PMC 18.90.060.

B. A radio antenna system placed or maintained contrary to this article is a public nuisance.

C. A radio antenna system placed or maintained contrary to this article may be abated as follows:

1. A radio antenna system which does not meet the requirements of PMC 18.84.030, or the conditions of a use permit issued under PMC 18.84.035 or the conditions of an exception issued under PMC 18.84.040, or which imperils the safety of people or property is subject to removal by the owner or, upon the owner’s failure to remove, by the city.

2. A radio antenna system may be abated and the expense of abatement will be a lien against the property and a personal obligation against the property owner. The abatement procedure is that set forth in Chapter 1.24 PMC.

D. Each radio antenna system is subject to reinspection by the city. No addition, change, or modification may be made to a radio antenna system unless the addition, change or modification is in conformity with the building permit, PMC 18.84.035 and the restrictions of the use permit. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.84.050 Existing radio antenna systems.
A. This article does not affect an existing radio antenna system utilized by an amateur radio operator, which has been constructed and is in place at the time of adoption of the ordinance codified in this article. However, the owner of the existing radio antenna system whose system has not previously been approved by the building division must submit to the building division, within one year of the date of adoption of this article, an application for a building permit as required by PMC 18.84.030(A). No fee is required for a building permit for an existing radio antenna system.

B. An existing radio antenna system which is moved or whose antenna height is increased is no longer nonconforming and is subject to the requirements of this article. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.84.055 Nonexclusive regulation.
This article supplements and is in addition to other regulatory codes, statutes, and ordinances. [Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

Article III. Reserved

18.84.205 Fence and wall heights.
A. Measurement of Height. The height of a fence or wall used as a fence is measured from the point at which the fence posts or wall pilasters intersect the ground. Where a fence is built on top of a retaining wall, the fence height is measured from the highest adjacent grade.

B. R District – Maximum Height within a Required Yard.

1. Side and rear: six feet.

2. Front and corner side of a reverse corner lot: four and one-half feet; provided, that the portion above three feet in height must have generally uniformly spaced interstices to allow 66 and two-thirds percent open area between the fence material.

3. Front yard of a key lot: four and one-half feet; provided, that the portion of three feet in height must have generally uniformly spaced interstices to allow 66 and two-thirds percent open area between the fence material. Fence height may be increased to six feet, only on the property line shared by the key lot and adjoining reverse corner lot, and only between the rear of the required front yard and the point along the property line that is as far away from the front lot line as the width of the required corner side yard of the adjoining key lot.

4. Corner side: six feet, except for the portion of the lot within three feet of the edge of the sidewalk, or three feet from the curb or pavement if there is no sidewalk, in which the maximum height is four and one-half feet; provided, that the portion above three feet in height must have generally uniformly spaced interstices to allow 66 and two-thirds percent open area between the fence material.

5. Corner side sight visibility triangle: four and one-half feet; provided, that the portion above three feet in height must have generally uniformly spaced interstices to allow 66 and two-thirds percent open area between the fence material within a triangle formed by the intersecting street lines and a line joining points on these street lines at a distance of 30 feet from the intersection of these lines.

C. C and I Districts.

1. C district maximum height: eight feet;

2. I district maximum height: eight feet if adjacent to an R or C district; 12 feet in any other area;

3. Front and corner side yard: the maximum height permitted within a required front or corner side yard is three feet.

D. Nonresidential Use Adjacent to R District. An eight-foot-high solid masonry or concrete wall or a wall designed to attenuate the CNEL to the maximum level allowed in the general plan for the proposed land use must adjoin the property line of the site of a new nonresidential use abutting an R district. However, no wall is required where the portion of the site within 10 feet of the front property line is occupied by a planting area.

E. Recreation and Public Facilities. The maximum height of a fence that encloses a schoolground, public playground, tennis, basketball or volleyball court, public, community, or commercial swimming pool, public facility or utility is 14 feet.

F. Exceptions to Height Regulations. The fence height standards as required in this section may be increased or limited under the following provisions:

1. Environmental Mitigation. The height of a fence may be established upon acceptance by the planning commission of the mitigation measures of an environmental impact report in order to mitigate adverse noise or visual impacts.

2. Zoning Administrator Approval or Use Permit. The maximum fence height standards may be increased or the required fence criteria may be reduced or modified by the issuance of a zoning administrator approval under Chapter 18.32 PMC or in conjunction with the issuance of a use permit for a proposed use. Such a permit may be issued under the following provisions:

a. Fence height requirements may be exceeded, reduced, or modified without specific findings of hardship or unusual circumstances when reviewed and adequately controlled to assure that the area will assume or retain the characteristics intended by zoning.

b. Findings must be made that the installation or construction of a fence or wall, under the conditions of the particular case, will not infringe upon the light, air circulation or visual openness of surrounding properties; detract, impair or destroy the characteristics of the established area; nor be detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of persons residing or working in or adjacent to the area or neighborhood of such structure.

c. In approving the permit, the planning commission or zoning administrator may impose such conditions deemed necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding area or neighborhood, in line with the standards prescribed in this section and with the general plan. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 05-1257 § 4, 2005; Ord. 1055 (Exh. A), 1992; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.84.210 Building permit required.
A building permit is required for any fence over six feet in height. A retaining wall over three feet in height or supporting a surcharge or impounding Class I, II, or III-A liquids requires a building permit, including plans and calculations stamped and signed by a registered structural or civil engineer. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 979 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990.]

18.84.215 Encroachment permit required.

3. Electrification – IEC Standards. Unless otherwise specified herein, electric fences shall be constructed or installed in conformance with the specifications set forth in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard No. 60335-2-76.

4. Conditions for Installation.

a. Location. Electric fences shall be permitted only on properties located in CS, CSD and I districts, but shall not be installed on any property line that adjoins the property with other property located in a CP, CN, CO, CC, M, GQ, R, HPD or residential PD district. Electric fences are prohibited within 25 feet of any outdoor area utilized for the storage, use, or handling of hazardous materials as defined in the California Fire Code. Electric fences are prohibited inside of a building and within the front or corner side yard of a lot.

b. Perimeter Fence or Wall. No electric fence shall be installed or used unless it is completely surrounded by a nonelectrified fence or wall that is not less than eight feet high. The perimeter fence shall be solid, without spaces or gaps, and separated from the electrified fence by a maximum of eight inches. No part of a perimeter fence shall be allowed to be in contact with the electric fence. The area between the perimeter wall or fence and the electric fence, as well as any area within two feet of the electric fence, shall be paved with gravel or concrete and kept clear of landscaping, weeds, shrubbery, trash, other fences or material of any kind. Perimeter fences or walls shall be view-obscuring and shall be a masonry or concrete wall, wood privacy fence, or an equivalent solid barrier fence.

c. Height. The height of electric and perimeter fences shall comply with PMC 18.84.205(C)(2).

d. Warning Signs. Electric fences shall be clearly identified with warning signs prepared in English and Spanish that read, “Warning: Electric Fence,” above or alongside universal symbols that indicate the presence of an electrified fence.

All fence sections shall be clearly marked with a sign stating “This is a Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) and disturbance of this area is not allowed.” The sign shall also list contact information for the contractor and the arborist and clearly state that a violation of the TPZ will result in a stop work order.

C. Prohibited Activities within the Drip Line. No oils, gas, chemicals, liquid waste, solid waste, heavy construction machinery or other construction materials shall be stored or allowed to stand within the drip line of any protected tree. No equipment may be washed within the drip line of any protected tree.

D. Excavation and Construction within Drip Line. The existing ground within the drip line of any protected tree shall not be cut, filled or compacted unless otherwise approved by the city planner. Excavation adjacent to any tree when permitted shall be in such a manner so as to minimize root damage. Utility services, drainage lines, sewer, sub-drains, irrigation lines, and any services requiring excavation shall be designed to stay outside the drip line of existing trees when at all feasible. If excavation for such lines is permitted within the drip line, it should be arched around the tree as much as possible. Tunneling, boring, hydraulic or high-pressure air trenching, rather than trenching, shall be the favored means of installation. Being the shortest distance between two points does not justify encroaching within the drip line of a tree.

E. Attachments. No signs or wires, except those needed for support of the tree, shall be attached to any protected tree.

F. Herbicides. Any herbicides placed under paving materials must be safe for use around trees and labeled for that use.

G. Damage. The city planner shall be notified by the owner, developer, contractor or any agent thereof of any damage that occurs to a protected tree during construction so that professional methods of treatment accepted by the city planner may be administered. The repair of the damage shall be at the expense of the responsible party and shall be by professional standards, approved by the city planner. Failure to comply will result in a stop work order.

H. Project Arborist. The city planner shall require an arborist to be on site at such times during development as the city planner determines appropriate. Such arborist shall be retained by the project developer. The approved arborist shall provide the city planner his or her qualifications along with a written certification that he or she has reviewed this article and will abide by it. Following completion of the development, the arborist shall certify that the development was performed properly in conformance with this chapter and good forestry practices.

I. Security/Performance Bond. The city may require the applicant, as a condition of issuing a grading permit, to post a security bond or cash deposit pursuant to the requirements of PMC 15.88.070. [Ord. 15-1390 § 3 (Exh. A), 2015.]

18.84.865 Maintenance of protected trees.
A. Routine Pruning. The pruning of a protected tree shall be performed when and only when it enhances its structural strength, health, general appearance or for safety reasons. Any pruning must be consistent with good pruning practice as outlined by the current edition of the International Society of Arboriculture’s Tree-Pruning Guidelines and the current edition of the A300 standard of the American National Standards Institute and not harm the tree structurally or aesthetically. All pruning of protected trees shall be performed by an arborist or a certified tree worker.

B. Utility Clearance. All utility companies must contact the department of public works at least five working days (except in emergencies) prior to taking any action to prune any protected tree(s) related to line clearance. All pruning shall be consistent with good pruning practices as outlined by the current edition of the International Society of Arboriculture’s Utility Pruning of Trees and the current edition of the A300 standard of the American National Standards Institute. The director of public works shall cause such pruning work to be inspected, when the director considers it to be appropriate, to ensure that good pruning practices previously referenced are followed. The director of public works shall have the authority to stop any tree pruning performed by a utility if such practices are not being followed. [Ord. 15-1390 § 3 (Exh. A), 2015.]

18.84.870 Enforcement and penalty for violation.
A. Administrative Citations. A person who violates this article is guilty of an infraction and shall be punished as provided in PMC 18.90.060.

B. Civil Sanctions. In addition to paying the penalties for violation of this article, a person who removes or destroys a protected tree in violation of this article shall:

1. Replace the removed or destroyed tree at a ratio of 12 to one with 24-inch box trees; or

2. Replace the removed or destroyed tree at a ratio of 36 to one with 15-gallon trees; or

3. Compensate the city for the value of the original tree and the costs associated with the required replacement trees (including installation and one year of maintenance costs) described in this section. [Ord. 15-1390 § 3 (Exh. A), 2015.]

18.84.910 Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the content clearly indicates a different meaning.

“Antenna” is the arrangement of wires, poles, rods or other devices used for the transmission or reception of electromagnetic waves.

“Applicant” is any person or entity who applies for design review approval or a building permit pursuant to the requirements of this article.

“Arrays” are several antennas connected and arranged in a regular structure to form a single antenna.

“Base station” means the same as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001(b)(1), as may be amended, which defines the term as follows: A structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001(b)(9), or any equipment associated with a tower.

1. The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.

2. The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including distributed antenna systems and small-cell networks).

3. The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time a relevant application is filed under Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001 et seq., supports or houses equipment described in subsections (1) and (2) of this definition and that has been reviewed and approved under the requirements of Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001 et seq., or under another state or local regulatory review process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support.

4. The term does not include any structure that, at the time a relevant application is filed under Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001 et seq., does not support or house equipment described in subsections (1) and (2) of this definition.

Note: As an illustration and not a limitation, a “base station” refers to any structure that actually supports wireless equipment even though it was not originally intended for that purpose. Examples include, but are not limited to, wireless facilities mounted on buildings, utility poles and transmission towers, light standards or traffic signals. A structure without wireless equipment replaced with a new structure designed to bear the additional weight from wireless equipment constitutes a base station.

“Collocation” means the same as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001(b)(2), as may be amended, which defines the term as the mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes. As an illustration and not a limitation, “collocation” effectively means “to add” and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless facility installed at a single site.

“Eligible facilities request” means the same as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001(b)(3), as may be amended, which defines the term as any request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving: (1) collocation of new transmission equipment; (2) removal of transmission equipment; or (3) replacement of transmission equipment.

“Eligible support structure” means the same as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which defines the term as any tower or base station; provided, that it is existing at the time a relevant application is filed under this chapter.

“Existing” means the same as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001(b)(5), as may be amended, which provides that a constructed tower or base station is existing for purposes of Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001 et seq., if it has been reviewed and approved under the requirements of this chapter, or under another state or local regulatory review process; provided, that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this definition.

“Section 6409(a)” means Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, codified as U.S. Code, Title 47, Chapter 13, Subchapter IV, Section 1455(a), as may be amended.

“Site” means the same as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001(b)(6), as may be amended, which provides that for towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted to that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.

“Stealth” refers to design techniques and elements that blend into the surrounding environment by means of screening, concealment, or camouflage and are so integrated into the surrounding natural or manmade environment that the observer does not recognize the structure as a wireless telecommunications facility. Examples include, but are not limited to: (1) wireless equipment placed completely within existing architectural features such that the installation causes no visible change to the underlying structure; (2) new architectural features that match the underlying building in architectural style, physical proportion and construction materials quality; (3) flush-to-grade underground equipment vaults with flush-to-grade entry hatches, with wireless equipment placed completely within.

“Substantial change” means the same as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, which defines that term differently based on the particular facility type and location. For clarity, the following provisions list the FCC’s criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the facility type (base station or tower) and location (outside or inside the public right-of-way):

1. For towers outside the public rights-of-way, a substantial change occurs when:

a. The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than 10 percent or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed 20 feet (whichever is greater); or

b. The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than 20 feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or

c. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four; or

d. The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site.

2. For towers in the public rights-of-way and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when:

a. The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than 10 percent or 10 feet (whichever is greater); or

b. The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than six feet from the edge of the wireless tower or base station; or

c. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or

d. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are 10 percent larger in height or volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or

e. The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.

3. In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change occurs when:

a. The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the city planner; or

b. The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval; provided, however, that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section.

Note: The thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are disjunctive. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur. The thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally permitted support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included in the original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012, the date that Congress passed Section 6409(a).

“Tower” means the same as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001(b)(9), as may be amended, which defines that term as any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting any FCC-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities, including structures that are constructed for wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul, and the associated site. Examples include, but are not limited to, monopoles, mono-trees and lattice towers.

“Transmission equipment” means the same as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001(b)(8), as may be amended, which defines that term as equipment that facilitates transmission for any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply. The term includes equipment associated with wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.

“Wireless telecommunications facility” and “facilities” is a facility that transmits or receives electromagnetic signals for any wireless services and includes, but is not limited to, personal wireless services facilities. Such facilities include antennas and related equipment used in the transmission or receipt of communication signals, such as towers, poles or similar support structures, and equipment cabinets or buildings.

The city planner may develop, publish and update, as needed, application forms, checklists, informational handouts and other related materials. Subject to the subsection (B) of this section exemption for applications submitted for a minor modification approval pursuant to Section 6409(a), all applications must at a minimum include the following information:

1. A fully dimensioned site plan, plans, and elevations drawn to scale, prepared by a California-licensed engineer or architect showing any existing wireless facilities with all existing transmission equipment and other improvements, the proposed facility with all proposed transmission equipment and other improvements and the legal boundaries of the leased or owned area surrounding the proposed facility and any associated access or utility easements. The site plans must include descriptions and physical dimensions for all existing transmission equipment, if any, and all proposed transmission equipment to be installed.

2. Visual impact demonstrations using photographic simulations of the proposed facility in context of the site as it would be seen from reasonable line-of-sight locations from residential areas, public rights-of-way, public parks, and/or other sites as deemed appropriate by the city planner, together with a map that shows the photo location of each view angle.

3. A written description of the proposed approach for screening or camouflaging all facilities from public view, including plans for installation and maintenance of landscaping, sample exterior materials and colors, and an explanation of the measures by which the proposed facility would be camouflaged or rendered not readily visible. Where any part of the proposed facility would be readily visible, the application shall include a written explanation as to why it cannot or would not appropriately be screened or camouflaged from public view.

4. The applicant must provide a list of all existing structures considered as alternatives to the proposed location, together with a general description of the site design considered at each location. The applicant must also provide a written explanation as to why the alternatives considered were unacceptable or infeasible, unavailable or not as consistent with the development standards in this article as the proposed location. This explanation must include a meaningful comparative analysis and such technical information and other factual justification as are necessary to document the reasons why each alternative is unacceptable, infeasible, unavailable or not as consistent with the development standards in this article as the proposed location. If an existing facility is listed among the alternatives, the applicant must specifically address why the modification of such wireless communication facility is not a viable option. When an applicant proposes a site in the public right-of-way, the initial alternative sites analysis required for a complete application may evaluate other potential locations and designs in the right-of-way.

5. Copies of, or a sworn statement by, an authorized representative that applicant holds all applicable licenses or other approvals required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC), and any other agency of the federal or state government with authority to regulate wireless telecommunications facilities that are required in order for the applicant to construct the proposed facility, and that applicant is in compliance with all conditions imposed in conjunction with such licenses or approvals.

6. A written statement that includes: (a) a description of the technical objectives to be achieved; (b) an annotated topographical map that identifies the targeted service area to be benefited; (c) the estimated number of potentially affected users in the targeted service area; and (d) full-color signal propagation maps with objective units of signal strength measurement that show the applicant’s current service coverage levels from all adjacent sites without the proposed site, predicted service coverage levels from all adjacent sites with the proposed site, and predicted service coverage levels from the proposed site without all adjacent sites.

7. A radio frequency (RF) report acceptable to the city prepared and certified by an RF engineer that certifies that the proposed facility, as well as any collocated facilities, will comply with applicable federal RF exposure standards and exposure limits. The RF report must include the actual frequency and power levels (in watts ERP) for all existing and proposed antennas at the site and exhibits that show the location and orientation of all transmitting antennas and the boundaries of areas with RF exposures in excess of the uncontrolled/general population limit (as that term is defined by the FCC) and also the boundaries of areas with RF exposures in excess of the controlled/occupational limit (as that term is defined by the FCC). Each such boundary shall be clearly marked and identified for every transmitting antenna at the project site.

8. A fully completed and executed application form as required by the city, as may be amended or updated from time to time. The applicant must state the approval it seeks (i.e., design review or minor modification pursuant to Section 6409(a)).

9. An application fee established by the city, as may be amended or updated from time to time.

10. A cash or other sufficient deposit tendered by the applicant to the city for any third party peer review determined by the city to be necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of this article.

B. Application Submittal Requirements for Minor Modifications.

1. Notwithstanding subsection (A) of this section, applications for minor modifications pursuant to Section 6409(a) are exempt from the requirements in subsections (A)(3), (4) and (6) of this section.

2. An applicant that submits an application for a minor modification approval pursuant to Section 6409(a) shall provide a written statement that explains in plain factual detail whether and why Section 6409(a) and the related regulations at Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 1, Subpart CC, Section 1.40001 et seq., require approval for the specific project. A complete written narrative analysis shall state the applicable standard and all the facts that allow the city to conclude the standard has been met—bare conclusions not factually supported do not constitute a complete written analysis. As part of the written statement the applicant must also include: (a) whether and why the support structure qualifies as an existing tower or existing base station; and (b) whether and why the proposed collocation or modification does not cause a substantial change in height, width, excavation, equipment cabinets, concealment or permit compliance.

An applicant that submits an application for a minor modification approval pursuant to Section 6409(a) shall provide true, correct and complete copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals, including without limitation any conditions of approval, issued in connection with the tower or base station to be collocated on or modified.

C. Pre-Application Meeting Appointment. Prior to application submittal, applicants must schedule and attend a pre-application meeting with a member of the planning staff for all proposed new non-stealth freestanding wireless facilities. Such pre-application meeting is intended to streamline the application review through discussions including, but not limited to, the appropriate project classification, including whether the project may qualify for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a); potential concealment issues (if applicable); coordination with other city departments responsible for application review; and the materials required for a complete application. For all other projects, pre-application meetings are strongly encouraged but not required. City staff will endeavor to provide applicants with an appointment within approximately five business days after receipt of a written or email request.

D. Application Submittal and Resubmittal Procedures. All applications must be submitted to the city at a pre-scheduled appointment. Applicants may submit one application per appointment but may schedule successive appointments for multiple applications whenever feasible for the city. City staff will endeavor to provide applicants with an appointment within approximately five working days after a request.

E. Deemed-Withdrawn Applications. To promote efficient review and timely decisions, an application will be automatically deemed withdrawn when an applicant fails to tender a substantive response within 90 days after the city deems the application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant. The city planner may, in the city planner’s sole discretion, grant a written extension for up to an additional 30 days upon a written request for an extension received prior to the ninetieth day. The city planner may grant further written extensions only for good cause, which includes circumstances outside the applicant’s reasonable control. [Ord. 16-1418 § 4 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 15-1390 § 3 (Exh. B), 2015.]

18.84.930 Standards of review for design review applications.
A. Required Findings. Prior to the approval of a design review or minor modification request, the applicable reviewing authority shall review the application in accordance with the following:

1. Design Review. The planning commission review shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this article and in accordance with the following standards:

a. The wireless telecommunications facility conforms with good taste, good design and in general contributes to the character and image of the city as a place of beauty, spaciousness, balance, taste, fitness, broad vistas, and high quality;

b. The exterior design and appearance of the wireless telecommunications facility is not of inferior quality as to cause the nature of the neighborhood to materially depreciate in appearance and value;

c. The wireless telecommunications facility is in harmony with proposed developments on land in the general area;

d. The application conforms with the criteria set forth in any applicable city-adopted design guidelines; and

e. The applicant demonstrated that it proposed the least intrusive means to achieve its technical objectives.

2. Minor Modification Pursuant to Section 6409(a). The city planner may approve a minor modification pursuant to Section 6409(a) when the city planner finds that the proposed collocation or modification qualifies as an eligible facilities request and does not cause a substantial change.

a. In addition to any other alternative recourse permitted under federal law, the city planner may deny a minor modification permit when the city planner finds that the proposed collocation or modification:

i. Violates any legally enforceable standard or permit condition reasonably related to public health and safety; or

ii. Involves a structure constructed or modified without all regulatory approvals required at the time of the construction or modification; or

iii. Involves the replacement of the entire support structure; or

iv. Does not qualify for mandatory approval under Section 6409(a) for any lawful reason.

b. Any denial of a minor modification pursuant to Section 6409(a) application shall be without prejudice to the applicant, the real property owner or the project. Subject to the application and submittal requirements in this article, the applicant may immediately submit a new permit application for design review as appropriate.

B. Location Criteria. The following location criteria should be considered when locating new wireless telecommunications facilities:

1. Wireless telecommunications facilities may be approved on or near historic structures, historic districts, and scenic corridors as defined in the general plan only when the transmission equipment is so concealed as to be invisible from residential areas, public rights-of-way, public parks, and/or other sites as deemed appropriate by the planning commission. The views of, and vistas from, such structures, districts, and corridors shall not be impaired or diminished by the placement of wireless telecommunications facilities and related equipment.

2. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be collocated whenever technically feasible and where the collocation does not create an adverse aesthetic impact due to such factors as increasing the bulk, height, traffic or ambient noise created by the proposed wireless telecommunications facilities.

3. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be preferred in industrial and commercial districts and shall not be located in residential districts to the greatest extent feasible.

4. Wireless telecommunications facilities proposed in the public rights-of-way shall be sited in accordance with the city’s preferences to the maximum extent feasible. In order of most preferred to least preferred, the city prefers wireless facilities placed on: (a) existing city-owned right-of-way structures; then (b) other existing rights-of-way structures; then (c) new rights-of-way structures. The planning commission may authorize a less-preferred placement only when it finds that either (i) no more-preferred locations are available or (ii) placement of a proposed wireless telecommunications facility in the public right-of-way on a less-preferred structure would be less intrusive based on the particular facts and circumstances involved. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to give an applicant the right to use or access the public right-of-way without an encroachment permit issued pursuant to Chapter 12.01 PMC.

C. Height Requirements. New wireless telecommunications facilities shall meet the following height requirements:

1. All freestanding wireless telecommunications facilities shall be designed at the minimum functional height required for the coverage area unless the planning commission determines that additional height is needed for architectural reasons.

2. No wireless telecommunications facility shall exceed or project above the height limits specified for the base district in which the facility is located. For wireless telecommunications facilities proposed in the public right-of-way, the applicable height limit shall be the height limit specified for the nearest private property lot as measured from the lot line to base of the pole or other antenna support structure.

3. Wireless telecommunications facilities proposed on an existing building, structure, tower, or pole that is legal nonconforming in terms of height shall not exceed or project above the existing height of the building, structure, tower or pole.

D. Design Requirements. In addition to all other requirements set forth in this article, all wireless telecommunications facilities shall meet the following design requirements to the maximum extent feasible:

1. All wireless telecommunications facilities shall be designed and located to minimize and conceal their visibility to the greatest extent feasible by means of placement, screening, and camouflage. Facilities shall be compatible in scale and architecturally integrated with the design of underlying and/or surrounding structures, built environment or the natural setting. The applicant shall use the least visible antennas feasible to accomplish the owner/service provider’s coverage or capacity objectives.

2. Related equipment shall be located inside a building or in underground vaults whenever possible. If related equipment is to be located inside a new equipment building, that building shall be located where it would be the least visible from surrounding properties and the public right-of-way and shall be screened through use of walls, fencing, year-round landscaping, or combinations thereof, which is appropriate in design, height and material to the character of the location and the structure to be screened.

3. Wireless telecommunications facilities may be integrated into existing or newly developed facilities that are functional for other purposes, including, but not limited to, ball field lights, shopping center freeway signs and flagpoles. All such structure-mounted wireless telecommunications facilities shall be designed to conceal all the transmission equipment, including without limitation the incorporation of radomes and internal cable risers.

4. Architectural additions and/or appurtenances to existing antenna support structures that are intended to conceal wireless telecommunications facilities shall be designed to be appropriate in mass, scale, material, texture, color and character with the existing antenna support structure.

5. All wireless telecommunications facilities shall comply with the setback requirements of the base district in which the facility is located, including without limitation the support structure and ground-mounted equipment.

6. Landscaping shall be planted as the planning commission determines to be necessary or appropriate to minimize the visual impact of the wireless telecommunications facility and, when feasible, to block the line of sight between facilities and adjacent residential uses and residentially zoned properties. The planning commission shall determine the appropriate minimum size of new trees and shrubs. Where appropriate and directly related to the applicant’s placement, construction, or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities, the applicant shall maintain and enhance existing landscaping on the site, including trees, foliage and shrubs, when used for screening unless the planning commission approves appropriate replacement landscaping.

7. Building-mounted facilities shall be architecturally integrated into the existing building. Facade-mounted equipment, not including any required screening, shall not project more than 18 inches from the face of the building or other support structure unless specifically authorized by the planning commission.

8. Colors and materials for facilities shall be chosen to minimize visibility. All visible exterior surfaces shall be constructed of nonreflective materials and finished to blend with the underlying or surrounding structures or natural environment. Facilities shall be painted or textured using colors to minimize their visual impact.

9. Newly constructed towers or monopoles should be capable of collocation.

10. Stealth monopoles disguised as a tree shall be of a height, character and placement that is appropriate to the location. The planning commission may require the applicant to plant additional new trees to blend the mono-tree into the surrounding environment. Stealth monopoles designed to look like a flagpole shall be discouraged.

11. Exterior lighting shall not be allowed on wireless telecommunications facilities except for timed or motion-sensitive lights required for use of authorized persons on site during hours of darkness or except as required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

12. Proposed facilities shall not result in a reduced number of available parking spaces below the amount required pursuant to Chapter 18.78 PMC.

13. All wireless telecommunications facilities shall be designed to be resistant to and minimize opportunities for unauthorized access, climbing, vandalism, graffiti, and other conditions that would result in hazardous conditions, visual blight, or attractive nuisances. The planning commission may require the provision of warning signs, fencing, anti-climbing devices, or other techniques to prevent unauthorized access and vandalism when, because of their location and/or accessibility, wireless telecommunications facilities have the potential to become an attractive nuisance. The design of the fencing and other access control devices shall be subject to design review.

14. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be used for advertising.

E. Wireless Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way. In addition to the generally applicable standards and guidelines provided in subsections (B) through (D) of this section, all proposed new and modifications to wireless telecommunications facilities in the public rights-of-way shall conform to the following requirements:

1. Applicants shall install all nonantenna equipment underground in any underground utility district as defined in Chapter 12.36 PMC. In all other districts, applicants must install all nonantenna equipment underground to the extent technically feasible, and the planning commission may require, as a condition of approval, that the applicant underground its nonantenna equipment at the time the project site becomes part of an underground utility district, if ever. This requirement will not be interpreted or applied to require applicants to underground any electric meter or emergency disconnect switch.

2. To minimize aesthetic impacts and the overall visual profile, all pole-mounted equipment must be installed as close to the pole as technically feasible, concealed within a shroud or other appropriate enclosure, painted flat and nonreflective colors to match the underlying pole and oriented away from prominent views. To the extent feasible, pole-mounted equipment must be placed behind existing signs or other pole attachments. All required or permitted signage in the rights-of-way must face toward the street or otherwise placed to minimize visibility from adjacent sidewalks and structures. All conduits, conduit attachments, cables, wires and other connectors must be placed within the pole when possible or otherwise concealed from public view to the extent feasible.

3. Ground-mounted equipment shall be least preferred as compared to undergrounded or pole-mounted equipment. The planning commission may require the applicant to place any ground-mounted equipment in landscaped areas or behind new or existing walls or fences.

4. Antennas should be mounted either flush to the pole or on top of the pole whenever feasible. Antennas must be screened within a radome or other similar concealment technique that covers the entire antenna and all cables, connectors and hardware. [Ord. 16-1418 § 4 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 15-1390 § 3 (Exh. B), 2015.]

The permittee shall keep the site, which includes without limitation any and all improvements, equipment, structures, access routes, fences and landscaped areas, in a neat, clean and safe condition in accordance with the approved plans and all conditions in this permit. The permittee shall keep the site area free from trash, debris, and litter at all times. The permittee, at no cost to the city, shall remove and remediate any graffiti or other forms of vandalism at the site within 48 hours after the permittee receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or other vandalism occurred.

11. The permittee shall be responsible for maintaining landscaping in accordance with the approved landscape plan and for replacing any damaged or dead trees, foliage, or other landscaping elements shown on the approved plan. Amendments or modifications to the approved landscape plan shall be submitted to the city planner for approval.

12. The permittee shall use all reasonable efforts to avoid any and all undue or unnecessary adverse impacts on nearby properties that may arise from the permittee’s construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal and/or other activities at the site. The permittee shall not perform or cause others to perform any construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal or other work that involves heavy equipment or machines on (a) any weekday between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. or (b) any Saturday, Sunday or holiday. The restricted work hours in this condition will not prohibit any work required to prevent an actual, immediate harm to property or persons, or any work during an emergency declared by the city. The community development director or the community development director’s designee may issue a stop work order for any work that violates this condition. In addition, the planning commission may revoke this permit if the permittee habitually or routinely violates this condition, whether the community development director or the community development director’s designee issued any stop work orders or not.

13. Each wireless telecommunications facility shall be operated in a manner that will minimize noise impacts to surrounding residents and persons using nearby parks, trails, and similar recreation areas. All air conditioning units, generators and any other equipment that might emit noise that would be audible from beyond the property line shall be enclosed or equipped with noise attenuation devices to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with applicable noise limitations under Chapter 9.44 PMC. Backup generators shall only be operated during periods of power outages or for testing. At no time shall equipment noise from any source exceed the standards specified in Chapter 9.44 PMC.

B. Minor Modification Standard Conditions of Approval. In addition to all applicable standard conditions of approval required under subsection (A) of this section, any minor modification approval granted by the city or deemed granted by the operation of law must include the following conditions of approval:

1. The city’s grant or grant by operation of law of a minor modification approval pursuant to Section 6409(a) constitutes a federally mandated modification to the underlying permit or approval for the subject tower or base station. The city’s grant or grant by operation of law of a minor modification permit pursuant to Section 6409(a) shall not extend the permit term for any design review approval or other underlying regulatory approval and its term shall be coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval for the subject tower or base station.

2. In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any portion of Section 6409(a) or any FCC rule that interprets Section 6409(a) such that federal law would not mandate approval for any Section 6409(a) modification, the permit or permits issued in connection with such Section 6409(a) modification(s) shall automatically expire one year from the effective date of the judicial order, or they may be extended by the city planner upon a written request from the permittee that shows good cause for an extension. A permittee shall not be required to remove its improvements approved under the invalidated Section 6409(a) modification when it has submitted an application for design review for those improvements before the one-year period ends.

3. The city’s grant or grant by operation of law of a minor modification permit pursuant to Section 6409(a) does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the city to challenge Section 6409(a), any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409(a) or any Section 6409(a) modification. [Ord. 16-1418 § 4 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 15-1390 § 3 (Exh. B), 2015.]

Any application to renew any design review or minor modification approval granted under this article must be tendered to the city between 365 days and 180 days prior to the expiration of the current permit, and shall be accompanied by all required application materials, fees and deposits for a new application as then in effect. The city shall review an application for permit renewal in accordance with the standards for new facilities as then in effect. The city may, but is not obligated to, grant a written temporary extension on the permit term to allow sufficient time to review a timely submitted permit renewal application. [Ord. 16-1418 § 4 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 15-1390 § 3 (Exh. B), 2015.]

18.84.960 Cessation of operations.
A. To promote public health, safety and welfare, the city planner may declare a facility abandoned or discontinued when:

1. The permittee notifies the city planner that it abandoned or discontinued the use of the facility for a continuous period of 90 days;

2. The permittee fails to respond within 30 days to a written notice sent by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, from the city planner that states the basis for the city planner’s belief that the facility has been abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of 90 days; or

3. The permit expires in the case where the permittee has failed to file a timely application for renewal in accordance with PMC 18.84.950.

B. After the city planner declares the facility abandoned or discontinued, the permittee shall have 90 days from the date of the declaration (or longer time as the city planner may approve in writing as reasonably necessary) to:

1. Reactivate the use of the abandoned or discontinued facility subject to the provisions of this article and all conditions of approval;

2. Transfer its rights to use the facility, subject to the provisions of this article and all conditions of approval, to another person or entity that immediately commences use of the abandoned or discontinued facility; or

3. Remove the facility and all improvements installed solely in connection with the facility, and restore the site to its original condition, compliant with all applicable codes, consistent with the then-existing surrounding area.

C. If the permittee fails to act as required within the prescribed time period, the planning commission may deem the facility abandoned at a noticed public meeting. The city planner shall send written notice by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, to the last-known permittee or real property owner, that provides 30 days (or longer time as the city planner may approve in writing as reasonably necessary) from the notice date to:

1. Reactivate the use of the abandoned or discontinued facility subject to the provisions of this article and all conditions of approval;

2. Transfer its rights to use the facility, subject to the provisions of this article and all conditions of approval, to another person or entity that immediately commences use of the abandoned or discontinued facility; or

18.86.080 Alternatives to construction of affordable units on-site of owner projects or low-density owner projects.
A. Information and Finding Required. In lieu of building all required affordable units within an owner project or low-density owner project, a developer may elect to meet the basic affordability requirements of this chapter by utilizing one of the alternatives listed in subsections (B), (C), (D) and (E) of this section. Any request for off-site construction of affordable units, land dedication, in lieu fee payment or conversion of existing market rate units to affordable units shall include a written explanation of why the alternative compliance measure is being requested. The request for off-site compliance shall be subject to the discretion of the city council, who may approve the request upon finding that the requested off-site compliance measure would provide an opportunity for public benefit not otherwise obtainable through on-site construction.

B. Off-Site Construction of Affordable Units. In lieu of building all required affordable units within an owner project or a low-density owner project, a developer may request to construct, or make possible construction by another developer, all or some affordable units on a site or sites not physically contiguous to the market rate units. Pursuant to subsection (A) of this section, any city council approval of a request to construct affordable units off-site will include a requirement that:

1. The number of affordable units constructed off-site will be greater than the number of affordable units required by the applicable PMC 18.86.040(A), (B) or (C), or will be affordable to households with lower incomes than would otherwise be required by the applicable PMC 18.86.040(A), (B) or (C); and

2. The developer purchase the site for the off-site affordable units, secure all planning entitlements, and record affordability covenants against the site prior to issuance of a building permit for the related market rate units; and

3. Final inspections for occupancy for the related market rate units are completed after those for the off-site affordable units, or the off-site affordable units are secured by a letter of credit from the developer in an amount at a minimum equal to the in lieu fee amount described under subsection (C) of this section; and

4. For low-density owner projects, the affordable units allowed by this subsection may be constructed as rental affordable units; provided, that each affordable unit shall have a minimum of three bedrooms and the affordable units are reserved as lower-income renter units, very low-income renter units or extremely low-income renter units in accordance with the basic requirements listed in PMC 18.86.040(A).

C. Fee In Lieu of Construction. Subject to the discretion of the city council, a developer of a residential project is permitted to pay fees in lieu of constructing affordable units if the city council finds that the residential project site is not suitable for affordable housing. To determine suitability for affordable housing, the city will consider issues such as proximity to schools, shopping, public transportation, and recreational amenities. In lieu fees shall be paid upon issuance of the first building permit for a residential project. If building permits are issued for only part of a residential project, the fee amount shall be based only on the number of units then permitted. The in lieu fee shall be set by the city by fee resolution or other action of the city council so that the fee amounts are equal to the cost of developing a comparable market rate unit on-site. The city council may annually review the fee authorized by this subsection, and may, based on that review, adjust the fee amount by resolution.

D. Land Dedication. In lieu of building all or a portion of the affordable units within a residential project, a developer may dedicate, without cost to the city, a lot or contiguous lots sufficient to accommodate at a minimum the number of required affordable units for the residential project that the developer elects not to build on-site. Wherever dedication of land is allowed by this chapter, the value of the land shall be determined by the city with a written appraisal report prepared and signed by an appraiser acceptable to the city. If the appraised value of the land is less than the total amount of in lieu fees otherwise required pursuant to subsection (C) of this section, the developer shall dedicate the land and pay an in lieu fee that is equal to the difference between the appraised value of the land and the total amount of in lieu fees otherwise required by subsection (C) of this section.

Pursuant to subsection (A) of this section, the acceptance of an offer to dedicate land in lieu of compliance with other provisions of this chapter is subject to the discretion of the city council, who shall consider whether:

1. The true value of the lot or lots to be dedicated is equal to or greater than the amount of in lieu fees based on the cost to construct the otherwise required affordable units; and

2. The lot or lots are suitable for construction of affordable units at a feasible cost, served by utilities, streets and other infrastructure and there are no hazardous materials or other material constraints on development of affordable housing on the lot or lots; and

3. The lot or lots are located near schools, transit, and services appropriate for an affordable housing project; and

4. The lot or lots are appropriately zoned with adequate density to accommodate the developer’s net affordable housing unit requirement; and

5. When dedicated to the city, the lot or lots will exhibit clear title; and

6. Any other terms and conditions as required by the city will be satisfied at the discretion of the city manager or the manager’s designee.

E. Purchase of Off-Site Covenants. At the discretion of the city council, a developer may elect to impose affordability covenants that restrict rents or sale prices of dwelling units in an off-site housing development to satisfy the requirements of this chapter. The affordability covenants must be sufficient to meet the definition of affordable units and meet the requirements set forth in PMC 18.86.040 and 18.86.100.

The imposition of affordability covenants may only satisfy 50 percent of the affordable unit requirements set forth in the applicable PMC 18.86.040(A), (B) or (C). A minimum of 50 percent of the affordable units allowed by this subsection shall be affordable to very low-income households, subject to the requirements set forth in the applicable PMC 18.86.040(A), (B) or (C). For purposes of meeting the affordable unit requirements set forth in the applicable PMC 18.86.040(A), (B) or (C), two units described under this subsection will count as one affordable unit. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 04-1229 § 3, 2004.]

18.86.090 Time performance required.
A. On-Site Construction. Affordable units required by this chapter shall be constructed and have had final inspections for occupancy prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the related market rate units in any residential project that is developed in a single phase. For residential projects that are developed in phases, the rate of building permit issuance, construction and final inspection of affordable units shall be proportional to the rate of building permit issuance, construction and final inspection of the market rate units within the residential project.

B. Alternative Compliance. No building permit shall be issued for any market rate unit in a residential project until the developer of the residential project has received certification from the city manager or the manager’s designee that the developer has met, or made arrangements satisfactory to the city to meet, an alternative requirement listed in PMC 18.86.080. No final inspection for occupancy for any market rate unit shall be conducted until the developer has constructed and had final inspections for occupancy of the affordable units off-site in accordance with the basic requirements of PMC 18.86.040, or until the developer has secured a letter of credit in an amount at a minimum equal to the in lieu fee amount described under PMC 18.86.080(C).

1. The documents required by subsection (A) of this section shall be consistent with California Health and Safety Code Section 33334.3(f)(1)(B), but in no case shall the minimum term be less than 45 years. In the case of owner-occupied affordable units that are transferred during the required term, renewed restrictions shall be entered into on each change of ownership during the 45-year renewal term. Affordable units that are owner-occupied and for which the city council has executed an equity participation agreement with the developer of the residential project shall not be subject to the minimum 45-year term required by this subsection.

2. The documents required by subsection (A) of this section shall prohibit subsequent rental occupancy unless approved by the city manager or the manager’s designee.

The maximum sales price permitted on resale of an affordable unit designated for owner-occupancy shall be the lower of: (a) fair market value or (b) the seller’s lawful purchase price under this chapter, increased by the rate of increase of area median income during the seller’s ownership. The documents required by subsection (A) of this section may authorize the seller to recover the market value at time of sale of capital improvements made by the seller and may authorize an increase in the maximum allowable sales price to achieve such recovery. The resale restrictions shall allow the city a right of first refusal to purchase any affordable owner-occupancy unit at the maximum price that could be charged to a purchaser household, at any time the owner proposes sale. [Ord. 07-1284 § 3 (Exh. F), 2007; Ord. 04-1229 § 3, 2004.]

18.86.110 Use and expenditure of fees.

ii. A master sign program;

iii. An exception to the sign regulations of this title; and

iv. Any application referred by the city planner.

c. The city planner shall review all other sign review applications. The city planner may refer review of an application to the planning commission.

4. Expiration. Approval of a sign review permit or master sign program expires one year after the effective date of the approval unless the sign is placed or construction is underway and diligently pursued before the expiration of one year.

The reviewing body may extend the date for not more than one additional year if a written request is filed with the city planner before the expiration date.

5. Appeal. The decision of the city planner may be appealed to the planning commission and a decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council. A written request for appeal must be filed with the city planner within 10 days after the decision. The appellant shall pay an appeal fee in an amount established by city council resolution, except that a city councilmember or the city manager filing an appeal in the interest of the city need not pay the fee.

B. Temporary Sign Permit. A temporary sign permit is required for a community event sign on public property (PMC 19.12.050(E)) or a promotional sign (PMC 19.12.050(F)).

C. Exceptions. Upon application, either the planning commission may grant an exception to a regulation if the commission finds that:

1. The proposed exception conforms as closely as practicable to the sign size, number and placement regulations;

2. The proposed exception is not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the sign regulations of this title; and

3. Either:

a. Strict adherence to the sign regulations does not allow adequate identification of the site because of the site’s location or configuration, or because the proposed business or use is obscured from view by adjacent buildings or vegetation,

b. The architectural style, materials or construction elements of the building are such that a sign placed in conformance with this title would conflict with other aesthetic considerations set forth in Chapter 18.36 PMC, or

c. The master sign program for the site is nonconforming and a sign placed in conformance with this title would be inconsistent with the master sign program. [Ord. 15-1390 § 3 (Exh. C), 2015; Ord. 15-1388 § 3, 2015; Ord. 05-1257 § 4, 2005; Ord. 928 § 1, 1987.]

19.08.030 Method of determining number of signs and calculating sign area.
A. Number of Signs. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a sign is considered to be single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related or composed to form a unit. Where matter is displayed in a random manner, without organized relationship of elements, or where there is reasonable doubt about the relationship of elements, each element is considered to be a single sign.

B. Sign Area. The size of a sign is measured by the square area of the sign face (to the perimeter of the sign) or for random-element signs, the square area of a circle or the smallest polygon containing six sides or fewer of the sign face. The sign area does not include the supporting sign structure or architectural embellishment unless designed to form part of the display or an integral background for the display. When calculating the size of a multi-sided sign, only one side of the display area is measured. [Ord. 928 § 1, 1987.]

19.08.040 Master sign program.
A. Purpose. A master sign program is a coordinated sign plan which includes details of the size, type, placement, colors and design of all signs which are or will be placed on a site. The purpose of a master sign program is to ensure compatibility of signs on a multi-tenant building or building complex.

B. Requirements. A master sign program is required when signs are requested for a building which contains four or more business or office uses. The owner of such a building or his agent shall file an application with the city. A master sign program requires approval by the planning commission. If a building or building complex contains four or more business or office uses, the owner of the building shall have a master sign program approved by the city before any sign is placed.

C. In Lieu of Individual Permit. Notwithstanding the provisions of PMC 19.08.010(A), any sign which conforms to an approved master sign program does not require a separate sign review. [Ord. 05-1257 § 4, 2005; Ord. 928 § 1, 1987.]

19.08.050 Other sign regulations.
A. In addition to this title, signs in the city are governed by the general plan and by the following provisions of this code:

1. PMC Title 15, Buildings and Construction;

2. Building code (Chapter 15.08 PMC);

3. Electrical code (Chapter 15.16 PMC);

4. Sign code (Chapter 15.36 PMC);

5. Preservation of historic structures and establishment of historic district (Chapter 15.84 PMC) and any resolution or ordinance establishing design criteria under that chapter;

6. PMC Title 18, Zoning;

7. Design review (Chapter 18.36 PMC);

8. Any resolution or ordinance establishing regulations or standards under PMC Title 18.

B. In case of a conflict between sign regulations, the stricter regulation applies. [Ord. 05-1257 § 4, 2005; Ord. 928 § 1, 1987.]
