Ordinances shall be deemed to be in the exercise of the foregoing powers and
the performance of the foregoing functions.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.1)



1.04   INDEMNITY.



The applicant for any permit or license under this Code of Ordinances, by
making such application, assumes and agrees to pay for all injury to or death
of any person or persons whomsoever, and all loss of or damage to property
whatsoever, including all costs and expenses incident thereto, however
arising from or related to, directly, indirectly or remotely, the issuance of
the permit or license, or the doing of anything thereunder, or the failure of
such applicant, or the agents, employees or servants of such applicant, to
abide by or comply with any of the provisions of this Code of Ordinances or
the terms and conditions of such permit or license, and such applicant, by
making such application, forever agrees to indemnify the City and its

of the court where the action is pending, a brief statement of the alleged
facts from which the cause arose, that the City believes that the person
notified is liable to it for any judgment rendered against the City, and

liability of the City to the plaintiff in the first named action, and as to
the amount of the damage or injury.  The City may maintain an action against

1.06   RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. 



In the construction of the Code of Ordinances the following rules shall be
observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest
intent of the Council or repugnant to the context of the provisions.



1.   Verb Tense and Plurals.  Words used in the present tense include the
future, the singular number includes the plural and the plural number
includes the singular.



2.   May.  The word “may” confers a power.



3.   Must.  The word “must” states a requirement.



4.   Shall.  The word “shall” imposes a duty.



5.   Gender.  The masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter

6.   Interpretation.  All general provisions, terms, phrases, and
expressions contained in the Code of Ordinances shall be liberally construed
in order that the true intent and meaning of the Council may be fully carried
out.



7.   Extension of Authority.  Whenever an officer or employee is required
or authorized to do an act by a provision of the Code of Ordinances, the
provision shall be construed as authorizing performance by a regular
assistant, subordinate or a duly authorized designee of said officer or
employee.



1.07   AMENDMENTS. 



All ordinances which amend, repeal or in any manner affect this Code of
Ordinances shall include proper reference to chapter, section, subsection or

area adversely impacted by a major disaster, subject to the following
provisions:



A.   Critical Response Facilities.  Any police, fire, emergency medical
or emergency communications facility which will aid in the immediate
restoration of the area may be permitted in any zone for the duration of the
declared emergency;



B.   Other Temporary Uses.  Temporary use permits may be issued in any
zone, with conditions, as necessary, provided written findings are made
establishing a factual basis that the proposed temporary use:



(1)   will not be detrimental to the immediate neighborhood;



(2)   will not adversely affect the Comprehensive General Plan or any
applicable specific plan; and



(3)   will contribute in a positive fashion to the reconstruction and
recovery of areas adversely impacted by the disaster.



   Temporary use permits may be issued for a period of one year following
the declaration of local emergency and may be extended for an additional
year, to a maximum of two years from the declaration of emergency, provided
such findings are determined to be still applicable by the end of the first
year.  If, during the first or the second year, substantial evidence
contradicting one or more of the required findings comes to the attention of
the Recovery Task Force, then the temporary use permit shall be revoked.



7.   Temporary Repair Permits.  Following a disaster, temporary emergency
repairs to secure structures and property damaged in the disaster against
further damage or to protect adjoining structures or property may be made
without fee or permit where such repairs are not already exempt under other
chapters of the County and Municipal Codes.  The building official must be
notified of such repairs within ten working days, and regular permits with
fees may then be required.



8.   Deferral of Fees for Reconstruction Permits.  Except for temporary
repairs issued under provisions of this chapter, all other repairs,
restoration and reconstruction of buildings damaged or destroyed in the
disaster shall be approved through permit under the provisions of other
chapters of this Code. Fees for such repair and reconstruction permits may be
deferred until issuance of certificates of occupancy.



9.   Nonconforming Buildings and Uses.  Buildings damaged or destroyed in
the disaster which are legally nonconforming as to use, yards, height, number
of stories, lot area, floor area, residential density, parking or other
provisions of the zoning ordinance may only be repaired, reconstructed, or
replaced in conformance with adopted building or zoning regulations.



37.08   DEMOLITION OF DAMAGED BUILDINGS.



The Recovery Task Force shall coordinate with the jurisdictions having
authority to order the condemnation and demolition of historic buildings and
structures damaged in the disaster under the standard provisions of the
County and Municipal Codes.



37.09   TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT HOUSING.



The Recovery Task Force shall assign staff to work with FEMA, SBA, HUD, COE,
the State Emergency Management Division and other appropriate governmental
and private entities to identify special programs by which provisions can be
made for temporary or permanent replacement housing which will help avoid
undue displacement of people and businesses.  Such programs may include
deployment of mobile homes and mobile home parks under the temporary use
permit procedures provided in Section 37.07 of this chapter, use of SBA loans
and available Section 8 and Community Development Block Grant funds to offset
repair and replacement housing costs, and other initiatives appropriate to
the conditions found after a major disaster.



37.10   HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM.



Prior to a major disaster, the Emergency Management Commission/Recovery
Organization shall establish a comprehensive hazard mitigation program, which
includes both long-term and short-term components:



1.   Hazard Mitigation Plan.  The long-term component shall be prepared
and adopted by resolution of the Board of Supervisors and the respective City
Councils as the Hazard Mitigation of the County-wide Multi-hazard Plan, for
the purpose of enhancing long-term mitigation against future disasters.  The
hazard mitigation plan shall identify and map the presence, location, extent
and severity of natural, man-made, or civil hazards, such as:



A.   Severe flooding;



B.   Wildland and urban fires;



C.   Seismic hazards such as ground shaking and deformation, fault
rupture, liquefaction, and dam failure;



D.   Slope instability, mudslides, landslides and subsidence;



E.   Tornadoes and other high winds;



F.   Technological hazards, such as oil spills, natural gas leakage and
fires, hazardous and toxic materials contamination, nuclear power plant and
radiological accidents, other industrial accidents, and ground, air, and rail
transportation accidents;



G.   Civil incidents such as riots, terrorist actions, and crowd control
issues.



H.   The safety element shall determine and assess the community's
vulnerability to such known hazards and shall propose measures to be taken
both before and after a major disaster to mitigate such hazards.



2.   Short-Term Action Program.  A short-term hazard mitigation program
shall be included in the Recovery Plan.  It shall be comprised of hazard
mitigation program elements of highest priority for action, including
preparation and adoption of separate ordinances dealing with specific hazard
mitigation and abatement measures, as necessary.  Such ordinances may
require special site planning, land use and development restrictions or
structural measures in areas affected by flooding, urban/wildland fire, wind,
seismic or other natural hazards, or remediation of known technological
hazards such as toxic contamination.



3.   Post-Disaster Actions.  Following a major disaster, the Recovery
Task Force shall participate in the Multi-Agency Hazard Mitigation Team with
FEMA and other entities, as called for in Section 409 of the Stafford Act and
related federal regulations.  As appropriate, the Recovery Task Force may
recommend to the Board of Supervisors and the affected City Councils that the
County and affected Cities participate in the Hazard Mitigation Grant
Program, authorized in Section 404 of the Stafford Act in order to partially
offset costs of recommended hazard mitigation measures.



4.   New Information.  As new information is obtained regarding the
presence, location, extent, and severity of natural or technological hazards,
or regarding new mitigation techniques, such information shall be made
available to the public, and shall be incorporated as soon as practical
possible within the Linn County Multi-Hazard Emergency Operations Plan and
the Recovery Plan through amendment.



37.11   RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY.



At the earliest practicable time following the declaration of local emergency
in a major disaster, the Recovery Task Force shall prepare a strategic
program for recovery and reconstruction.



1.   Functions.  To be known as the Recovery Strategy, the proposed
strategic program shall identify and prioritize major actions contemplated or
under way regarding such essential functions as business resumption, economic
reinvestment, industrial recovery, housing replacement, infrastructure
restoration, and potential sources of financing to support these functions.



2.   Review.  The Recovery Strategy shall be forwarded to the Board of
Supervisors and the affected City Councils for review and approval following
consultation with FEMA, other governmental agencies, and business and citizen
representatives.  The Recovery Strategy shall provide detailed information
regarding proposed and ongoing implementation of initiatives necessary to the
expeditious fulfillment of critical priorities and will identify amendment of
any other plans, codes or ordinances that might otherwise contradict or
otherwise block strategic action.  The Recovery Task Force shall
periodically report to the Board of Supervisors and the affected City
Councils regarding progress toward implementation of the Recovery Strategy,
together with any adjustments which may be called for by changing
circumstances and conditions.

doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does in fact exist.  If compliance is
not secured following notice and hearings, we recommend you review the
situation with your attorney before proceeding with abatement and assessment
of costs.  Your attorney may recommend proceedings in court under Chapter
657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

1.   Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the keeping of
domestic chickens shall be permitted in all residential zoning districts so
long as such keeping is in compliance with this subsection and all other
applicable City ordinances unless, despite compliance with the following, the
presence of any particular chickens endanger the health, safety, peace,
quiet, comfort, enjoyment of, or otherwise become a public nuisance to nearby
residents or occupants or places of business:



   A.   Chickens must be confined in a coop or fowl house not less than
18 inches in height or, in the alternative, within a fenced pen area.
Chickens must be kept within the coop, the fowl house, or the fenced pen area
at all times unless removed for a temporary time for the  safety of the
chicken.



   B.   The coop, the fowl house, or the fenced pen area must be of
such a design to be reasonably expected to prevent entry by dogs, cats, or
other animals and shall be completely enclosed.

be well ventilated.

so there is no accumulation of moisture.



   F.   Any coop, fowl house, or fenced pen area shall be kept clean,
sanitary and free from accumulation of chicken excrement and objectionable
odors. All droppings and body excretions shall be either placed in fly-proof
containers and double-bagged in plastic bags or, in the alternative, used as

caused by dogs, cats, or other animals, domestic or wild, whether such

chicken caused by an animal is not, in and of itself, sufficient grounds for
the City to determine that the animal is a vicious animal pursuant to Chapter
56 of this Code of Ordinances.  Any dead chicken, not caused by
slaughtering, shall be disposed of immediately upon discovering in a manner
so as to not cause a nuisance pursuant to Chapter 50 of this Code of
Ordinances.



   L.   Any slaughter of chickens not regulated by state law or

provided in Chapter 3 of this Code of Ordinances.

57.03  Declaration of Dangerous Animal


57.02  Harboring Dangerous Animals Prohibited
 



 



57.01    DEFINITIONS. 



For use in this chapter and the Animal Control Code generally, the following
additional terms are defined:



1.   “Dangerous animal” means any animal that:



   A.   Inflicts severe injury on a human being without provocation on
public or private property;



   B.   Inflicts severe injury on or kills another animal without
provocation while the animal is off the owner’s or custodian’s property;



   C.   Aggressively bites, attacks, or endangers the safety of humans
or other animals;



   D.   Inflicts bites on a human or another animal either on public or
private property;



   E.   Chases or approaches a person upon the streets, sidewalks or
any public grounds in a menacing fashion or apparent attitude of attack; or



   F.   Has known propensity, tendency, or disposition to attack
unprovoked, to cause injury, or otherwise to threaten the safety of humans or
other animals.



An animal shall not be declared a dangerous animal if the threat, injury, or
damage was sustained by a person who, at the time, was committing a willful
trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner or custodian
of the animal, or was tormenting, abusing or assaulting the animal, or has,
in the past, been observed or reported to have tormented, abused or assaulted
the animal, or was committing or attempting to commit a crime.  If two or
more animals jointly engage in any conduct described in this subsection,
thereby rendering proof of the individual animal that inflicted any
particular injury difficult to ascertain, then regardless of the degree of
participation by the individual animals, all such animals shall be deemed
dangerous animals.



2.   “Microchip implant” means a passive electronic transponder that
is injected into an animal, subcutaneously, by means of a hypodermic-type
syringe device.  Each microchip shall contain a unique and original number
that is read by an electronic scanning device for purposes of animal
identification and recovery by the animal’s owner.  The microchip implant
shall be supplied with an exterior collar-type tag for purposes of an
external means of notifying others that the animal has been implanted with a
microchip.



3.   “Severe injury” means any physical injury which results in broken
bones, disfigurement, or lacerations requiring multiple sutures or surgery.



57.02  HARBORING DANGEROUS ANIMALS PROHIBITED. 



It is unlawful for any person to harbor or keep a dangerous animal within the
City.



57.03    DECLARATION OF DANGEROUS ANIMAL.



1.   Declaration of Dangerous Animal.  When the Police Chief has
sufficient information to determine that an animal is a dangerous animal, the
Police Chief shall declare the animal a dangerous animal and shall notify the
owner or custodian of the animal in writing, either in person or by regular
and certified mail.  The notice shall contain the following information:



   A.   The person receiving the notice is the owner or custodian of a
dangerous animal.



   B.   The breed, color, sex, and license number (if applicable and if
known) of the said animal.



   C.   A copy of the records relied upon by the Police Chief that form
the basis for declaring said animal to be a dangerous animal.  These records
may be supplemented with additional material as it becomes available.



   D.   An appeal form.



2.   Immediate Impoundment.  Any animal declared dangerous under this
section shall be immediately impounded.  Any animal declared a dangerous
animal that is not in the custody or control of the City shall be turned over
to the City by the owner or custodian within 24 hours from notification. 
The owner or custodian will have seven days from the date of the notice to
appeal the determination or the animal will be euthanized at the direction of
the Police Chief.  If the owner appeals the dangerous animal declaration,
the animal will be held at the shelter at the owner’s expense pending the
results of the appeal.



3.   Appeal.  To contest the declaration of dangerous animal, the owner
or custodian of the animal must request an administrative appeal hearing in
writing on a form provided with the notice within seven days of the date of
the notice.  If an administrative appeal hearing is requested, such hearing
will be convened pursuant to subsection 4 of this section.  At the
administrative appeal hearing, the records of the Police Chief, statements or
testimony of any witnesses, the results of any behavioral testing, and any
supplementary materials shall be admissible to prove the animal is a
dangerous animal.  The owner or custodian of the animal may require the
officer compiling the records to be present at the administrative appeal
hearing.  The owner or custodian of the animal may present evidence and
examine witnesses present.  The burden shall be on the City to establish by
a preponderance of the evidence that the animal is a dangerous animal.



4.   Administrative Appeal Hearing.  If the owner or custodian of the
animal requests an administrative appeal hearing, the hearing shall be held
before the City Administrator.  The administrative appeal hearing shall be
held within seven days after the receipt of the request for an administrative
appeal hearing, unless it is continued for good cause shown.  The City
Administrator shall notify the owner or custodian of the date, time, and
place for the administrative appeal hearing.  The administrative appeal
hearing shall be informal and open to the public.  The following procedures
shall apply:



   A.   All administrative appeal hearings before the City
Administrator shall be recorded, testimony shall be taken under penalty of
perjury, and witnesses may be subpoenaed.



   B.   The City Administrator shall render an oral decision at the
conclusion of the administrative appeal hearing or within five business
days.  This time may be extended at the discretion of the City Administrator
in order to receive additional information.  The oral decision shall be
reduced to writing and issued in accordance with subsection 5 of this
section.  It will include findings of fact and will be forwarded to the
appellant.



5.   Decision.  At the conclusion of the administrative appeal hearing,
the City Administrator shall have the authority to affirm, reverse, or modify
the declaration by the Police Chief that the animal is dangerous.  If the
City Administrator affirms the declaration and finds that the animal is
dangerous, the animal shall be euthanized unless the City exercises its
discretion, as set forth in subsection 9 of this section, to allow the animal
to be permanently removed from the City.  If the City Administrator finds
that the animal is not dangerous, the City Administrator shall order the
animal released, at which time the City Administrator may also impose
reasonable conditions of release upon the owner or custodian to prevent
further incidents involving the particular animal and to provide for better
protection of the general public.



6.   Notification.  The owner or custodian of the animal shall be
notified in writing by the City Administrator within five days of the
administrative appeal hearing of the decision, unless this time period has
been extended pursuant to subsection 4(B) of this section.  In no event
shall this time period be extended beyond ten days from the date of the
conclusion of the administrative appeal hearing, unless good cause is
shown.  The decision of the City Administrator is final.  The owner or
custodian of an animal determined by the City Administrator to be dangerous
may appeal the City Administrator’s decision to the District Court within
five days of the date of the City Administrator’s decision.



7.   Subsequent Action.  A finding that an animal is not a dangerous
animal shall not prevent the Police Chief from seeking to have the animal
declared a dangerous animal as the result of any subsequent action by the
animal.



8.   Costs and Expenses.  The owner or custodian of any animal declared
to be dangerous shall be liable to the City for all costs and expenses of
keeping such animal and any behavioral testing requested by the City, unless
a finding is subsequently made that the animal is not dangerous.



9.   Removal from City.  The City, in its sole discretion, may release a
dangerous animal by agreement with the owner or custodian if the owner or
custodian agrees to immediately remove the dangerous animal from the City
permanently and at a minimum, the owner or custodian of a dangerous animal to
be removed from the City shall provide the City with specific information as
to where the animal will be relocated, which in turn should be provided by
the City to animal control or law enforcement authorities of the appropriate
jurisdiction.  Also the owner or custodian shall have the animal injected
with a microchip implant for the purpose of permanent identification.  The
owner or custodian shall cooperate fully with the City in making and
providing records of the implant procedure and is responsible for all costs
associated with the procedure.  The City may but is not required to exercise
its discretion to enter into a permanent removal agreement with the owner or
custodian at any time during the process set out in this section.



10.   Dangerous Animal from Other Jurisdiction.  If an animal is known or
found to be in the City that has been declared dangerous by another
governmental entity, the City shall immediately impound the animal.  The
animal shall then either be returned to the governmental entity that declared
it to be dangerous or be subject to being declared dangerous by the Police
Chief in accordance with this section.

agency of a county or city.



80.02       AUTHORITY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.



A police authority, upon the authority's own initiative or upon the request
of any other authority having the duties of control of highways or traffic,
shall take into custody an abandoned vehicle on public property and may take
into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property.  The police
authority may employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a
private entity, equipment, and facilities for the purpose of removing,
preserving, storing, or disposing of abandoned vehicles.  A property owner
or other person in control of private property may employ a private entity
which is a garage keeper (any operator of a parking place or establishment,
motor vehicle storage facility, or establishment for the servicing, repair,
or maintenance of motor vehicles) to dispose of an abandoned vehicle, and the
private entity may take into custody the abandoned vehicle without a police
authority's initiative.  If a police authority employs a private entity to
dispose of abandoned vehicles, the police authority shall provide the private
entity with the names and addresses of the registered owners, all lienholders
of record, and any other known claimant to the vehicle or the personal
property found in the vehicle.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[2])



80.03       NOTICE BY MAIL.



The police authority or private entity that takes into custody an abandoned
vehicle shall notify, within twenty (20) days, by certified mail, the last

identification number of the vehicle, describe the personal property found in
the vehicle, set forth the location of the facility where the vehicle is
being held, and inform the persons receiving the notice of their right to
reclaim the vehicle and personal property within ten (10) days after the
effective date of the notice upon payment of all towing, preservation, and
storage charges resulting from placing the vehicle in custody and upon
payment of the costs of the notice.  The notice shall also state that the
failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants to exercise their right to
reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the time provided shall be
deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants of all right, title,
claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and that failure to
reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to the sale of the
vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a demolisher and to
disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction.  If the abandoned
vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a police
authority's initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity may
claim a garage keeper's lien as described in Section 321.90 of the Code of
Iowa, and may proceed to sell or dispose of the vehicle.  If the abandoned
vehicle was taken into custody by a police authority or by a private entity
hired by a police authority, the notice shall state that any person claiming
rightful possession of the vehicle or personal property who disputes the
planned disposition of the vehicle or property by the police authority or
private entity or of the assessment of fees and charges provided by this
section may ask for an evidentiary hearing before the police authority to
contest those matters.  If the persons receiving notice do not ask for a
hearing or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property
within the ten-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders or claimants
shall no longer have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the
vehicle or the personal property.  A court in any case in law or equity
shall not recognize any right, title, claim, or interest of the owner,
lienholders or claimants after the expiration of the ten-day reclaiming
period.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])



80.04       NOTIFICATION IN NEWSPAPER.



IIf it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section 80.03.  The published notice may contain multiple listings of
abandoned vehicles and personal property but shall be published within the
same time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for
mailed notice in Section 80.03.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])



80.05   FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.



The owner, lienholder or claimant shall pay all towing and storage fees as
established by the storage facility, whereupon the vehicle shall be released.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])



80.06   DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.



If an abandoned vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided herein, the police
authority or private entity shall make a determination as to whether or not
the motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways, and shall dispose
of the motor vehicle in accordance with State law.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])



80.07   DISPOSAL OF TOTALLY INOPERABLE VEHICLES.



The City or any person upon whose property or in whose possession is found
any abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle
whose title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such
motor vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without
notification procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two (2) or
more wheels or other structural part which renders the vehicle totally
inoperable.  The police authority shall give the applicant a certificate of
authority.  The applicant shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a
junking certificate and shall surrender the certificate of authority in lieu
of the certificate of title.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])



80.08   PROCEEDS FROM SALES.



Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the
expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing and notification
required, in accordance with State law.  Any balance shall be held for the
owner of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for ninety (90) days, and
then shall be deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund.  Where the sale of
any vehicle fails to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police
authority shall apply for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])



80.09   DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.



Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor vehicle
for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle or otherwise demolish such motor
vehicle.  A demolisher shall not junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle or demolish a
vehicle until the demolisher has obtained the junking certificate issued for
the vehicle.

without a waiver approved by the City Council.  All new private on-site well
applications to the City must meet the following minimum standards before the
application can be considered and may be subject to further conditions of
approval by the City Council:



1.   Compliance with regulations.  The type, capacity, location,
construction and layout of a proposed private on-site well system shall
comply with all applicable City, State and Federal laws, and will be subject
to compliance reviews by the City Engineer.



2.   Subdivisions.  Consideration of an application for a waiver to
construct or drill a private on-site well system is limited to plats created
under the minor subdivision procedures of Chapter 166 of the City Code or
individual lots whose property line sits more than 100 feet from a city water
main. The Council shall not grant applications for private on-site well
systems for lots created under the major subdivision procedures of Chapter
166.



3.   Feasibility. The Council shall deny applications for a waiver to
construct or drill a private on-site well system if the approved five year
capital improvement plan (CIP) includes the construction of a water main
which will bring a main within 100 feet of the property line of the lot.



4.   Mandatory Connection.  The developer or homeowner of any lot granted
a waiver under this subsection shall be required to sign a mandatory
connection agreement with the City requiring connection to a city water main
at such time one is provided within 100 feet of the property line.  Said
agreement shall be notarized and recorded with Linn County.



5.   Maintenance and Inspection.  The owners of the private well shall
cause the well to be inspected by a certified well driller at regular
intervals not to exceed five (5) years.  Copies of the well inspection
report shall be provided to the city engineer and shall include a detailed
description of the condition of the well casing, well pump and discharge
pipe, exposed formations and any contaminants present in the well as
determined through water quality testing (conducted by a State or certified
laboratory).



90.04       ABANDONED CONNECTIONS.



When an existing water service is abandoned or a service is renewed with a
new tap in the main, all abandoned connections with the mains shall be turned
off at the corporation stop and made absolutely watertight.



90.05       PERMIT.



Before any person makes a connection with the public water system, a written
permit must be obtained from the City.  The application for the permit shall
include a legal description of the property, the name of the property owner,
the name and address of the person who will do the work, and the general uses
of the water.  If the proposed work meets all the requirements of this
chapter and if all fees required under this chapter have been paid, the
permit shall be issued.  Work under any permit must be completed within
sixty (60) days after the permit is issued, except that when such time period
is inequitable or unfair due to conditions beyond the control of person
making the application, an extension of time within which to complete the
work may be granted.  The permit may be revoked at any time for any
violation of these chapters.



90.06       CONNECTION CHARGE.



The following charges shall be paid to the City prior to the installation of
a new water meter or the issuance of any water connection permit from the
premises to which the charges apply.  Each premise applying for a new water
service or water meter, as distinguished from a change in location or
reconnection of equivalent size, shall pay the connection charge, based on
meter size, per household equivalent, as follows:

In addition to the connection charge, any "out of pocket" expenses incurred
by the City in making water service available to the property served,
including but not limited to costs for meters larger than the rated size of
5/8" (See Section 91.07, Meter Costs)", shall be reimbursed to the City. 
Any labor expenses incurred by the City involved with the connection process
will be charged back to the applicant at the applicable labor rates and be
reimbursed back to the City.

any of the provisions of this chapter.  A suspension, unless revoked, shall
continue until the next regular meeting of the City Council.  The City
Administrator shall notify the plumber immediately by personal written notice
of the suspension, the reasons for the suspension and the time and place of
the Council meeting at which the plumber will be granted a hearing.  At this
Council meeting the City Administrator shall make a written report to the
Council stating the reasons for the suspension, and the Council, after fair
hearing, shall affirm or revoke the suspension or take any further action
that is necessary and proper.  The plumber shall provide a surety bond in
the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) secured by a responsible surety
bonding company authorized to operate within the State, conditioned to
indemnify and save the City harmless against all losses or damages that may
arise from or be occasioned by the making of connections to the water system
or excavations therefor or by carelessness, negligence or unskillfulness in
making the same.  Such bond shall remain in force and must be executed for a
period of one year except that on such expiration it shall remain in force as
to all penalties, claims and demands that may have accrued thereunder prior
to such expiration.  In lieu of a surety bond, a cash deposit of one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) may be filed with the City.



90.09       CONSTRUCTION BY THE CITY.



The installation and connection of the water service pipe from the property

shall install and connect the service pipe from the property line to the main
as soon as such construction can reasonably be accomplished.



3.    Additional Costs.  In the event the actual cost of the installation
and connection is in excess of the estimated cost, the property owner shall
reimburse the City for such additional costs within thirty days after
presentation of a bill therefor.



90.10       EXCAVATIONS.

1.   Independent Services.  No more than one house, building or premises
shall be supplied from one tap unless special written permission is obtained
from the Superintendent and unless provision is made so that each house,
building or premises may be shut off independently of the other.



2.   Sizes and Location of Taps.  All mains six (6) inches or less in
diameter shall receive no larger than a three-fourths (3/4) inch tap.  All
mains of over six (6) inches in diameter shall receive no larger than a one
inch tap.  Where a larger connection than a one inch tap is desired, two (2)
or more small taps or saddles shall be used, as the Superintendent shall
order.  All taps in the mains shall be made at or near the top of the pipe,
at least eighteen (18) inches apart.  No main shall be tapped nearer than
two (2) feet of the joint in the main.



3.   Corporation Stop.  A brass corporation stop, of the pattern and
weight approved by the Superintendent, shall be inserted in every tap in the
main.  The corporation stop in the main shall be of the same size as the
service pipe.




4.   Location Record.  An accurate and dimensional sketch showing the
exact location of the tap and curb stop shall be filed with the
Superintendent in such form as the Superintendent shall require.

the property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the service pipe
from the curb stop main shut-off valve to the building or destination
served. 



90.14       FAILURE TO MAINTAIN.



When any portion of the water service pipe which is the responsibility of the
property owner becomes defective or creates a nuisance and the owner fails to
correct such nuisance the City may do so and assess the costs thereof to the
property.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3a & h])



90.15       CURB VALVE.



There shall be installed within the public right-of-way a main shut-off valve
on the water service pipe at the outer sidewalk line with a suitable lock and
cover as approved by the Superintendent.



90.16       INTERIOR VALVE.



There shall be installed a shut-off valve on every service pipe inside the
building as close to the entrance of the pipe within the building as possible
and so located that the water can be shut off conveniently and the pipes
drained.  Where one service pipe supplies more than one customer within the
building, there shall be separate valves for each such customer so that
service may be shut off for one without interfering with service to the
others.



90.17       INSPECTION AND APPROVAL.



All water service pipes and their connections to the water system must be
inspected and approved in writing by the Superintendent before they are

the Superintendent refuses to approve the work, the plumber or property owner
must proceed immediately to correct the work.  Every person who uses or
intends to use the municipal water system shall permit the Superintendent to
enter the premises to inspect or make necessary alterations or repairs at all
reasonable hours and on proof of authority.



90.18       COMPLETION BY THE CITY.



Should any excavation be left open or only partly refilled for twenty-four
(24) hours after the water service pipe is installed and connected with the
water system, or should the work be improperly done, the Superintendent shall
have the right to finish or correct the work, and the Council shall assess
the costs to the property owner or the plumber.  If the plumber is assessed,
the plumber must pay the costs before receiving another permit, and the
plumber’s bond or cash deposit shall be security for the assessment.  If
the property owner is assessed, such assessment may be collected with and in
the same manner as general property taxes.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3a & h])



90.19       SHUTTING OFF WATER SUPPLY.



The Superintendent may shut off the supply of water to any customer because
of any violation of the regulations contained in these Water Service System
chapters that is not being contested in good faith.  The supply shall not be
turned on again until all violations have been corrected and the
Superintendent has ordered the water to be turned on.



90.20       OPERATION OF CURB VALVE AND HYDRANTS.



It is unlawful for any person except the Superintendent to turn water on at
the curb valve, and no person, unless specifically authorized by the City,

requirements and schedule set forth in the regulations and standards adopted
by Linn County.



90.22       BACKFLOW PREVENTION.



When the Superintendent concludes that a possible backflow condition could
result or a possible cross-connection exists in any commercial or industrial
premises connected to the public water system, the owner of such premises
shall take action deemed appropriate or install devices approved by the
Superintendent to correct the condition.  All costs shall be borne by the
owner and failure to take such action shall result in termination of water
service to the premises until the condition is corrected.

customers.



91.02       WATER USE METERED.



All water furnished customers shall be measured through meters furnished by
the City and installed by the City or an approved contractor.



91.03       FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS - EXCEPTION.



Fire sprinkler systems may be connected to water mains by direct connection

1.    Outside reading devices shall be required and installed on water
services and in accordance with the following:



A.    When billing for water service has been estimated for three
consecutive billing periods because the meter reader could not obtain
entrance to the premises at the time of appearance at the premises to read
the meter;



B.    When the current water customer as shown on the City Water
Department records discontinues the water service and a new customer
undertakes the service;



C.    Upon the request of the current customer; or



D.    As mandated by the installation schedule established by the City.



2.   The Water Department will install the outside reading device and the
owner of the property shall be responsible for payment of an installation fee
as set by resolution of the Council.  The outside reading device shall be
installed as close to the water meter as possible, with a minimum of thirty
(30) inches and a maximum of sixty (60) inches above the finished ground

3.   In residential rental properties, when conversion occurs due to
tenant change, any fees for outside meters and their installation will be
assessed against the landlord.



4.   Effective July 1, 1998, all new construction or remodeling, including
finishing walls or ceilings in basements, shall provide a ½-inch open
conduit to the outside of the building which shall run from the water meter
to the most acceptable front corner, as high on the outside wall as is
practical.



91.06       METER SETTING.



The property owner shall provide all necessary piping and fittings for proper
setting of the meter including a valve on the discharge side of the meter. 
Meter pits may be used only upon approval of the Superintendent and shall be
of a design and construction approved by the Superintendent.  All meters
shall be sealed to prevent tampering or altering of the metering or service
device so as to cause inaccurate readings.



91.07       METER COSTS.



The full cost of any meter larger than that required for a single-family
residence shall be paid to the City by the property owner or customer prior
to the installation of any such meter by the City, or, at the sole option of
the City, the property owner or customer may be required to purchase and
install such meter in accordance with requirements established by the City.



91.08       METER REPAIRS.



Whenever a water meter owned by the City is found to be out of order the
Superintendent shall have it repaired.  If it is found that damage to the
meter has occurred due to the carelessness or negligence of the customer or
property owner, or the meter is not owned by the City, then the property
owner shall be liable for the cost of repairs.



91.09       RIGHT OF ENTRY.



The Superintendent shall be permitted to enter the premises of any customer
at any reasonable time to read, remove, or change a meter.



91.10       METER TESTING.



The Superintendent or any designee shall make a test of the accuracy of any
water meter at any time when requested in writing.  If it is found that such
meter overruns to the extent of 5% or more, the cost of the test shall be
paid by the City and a refund shall be made to the customer for overcharges
collected since the last known date of accuracy, but not more than 5% of the
total water bill and not for a longer period than 3 months.  If the meter is
found to be accurate or slow or less than 5% fast, the user shall pay a

building, premises or connection shall be considered a separate and distinct
customer whether owned or controlled by the same person or not.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



92.02       USAGE RATE.



Beginning on July 1, 2012, each customer will pay water service charges in
the amount of $45.54 per 1000 cubic feet of water attributable to the
customer for the property served but in no event less than $10.00 per month
(a 10% increase over the previous rate of $9.09).  Beginning on July 1, 2013
and on July 1st of each succeeding year until June 30, 2024, the water
service charge shall increase 3% and the minimum service charge will increase
3%.  In any fiscal year in which revenues are expected to exceed
expenditures by 25%, the Council, by resolution, shall suspend the rate
increase, in whole or in part, so long as revenues exceed operations and
maintenance expenditures by 25%.  Beginning August 1, 2016, the water
service charge will increase 5%.  This increase is in addition to the
automatic 3% increase effective July 1, 2016.



92.03   RATES OUTSIDE THE CITY.



Water service shall be provided to any customer located outside the corporate
limits of the City which the City has agreed to serve at the same rates
provided in Section 92.02.  No such customer, however, will be served unless
the customer shall have signed a service contract agreeing to be bound by the
ordinances, rules and regulations applying to water service established by
the Council.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.4 & 384.84)



92.04       BILLING FOR WATER SERVICE.



Water service shall be billed as part of a combined service account, payable
in accordance with the following:



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



1.   Bills Issued.  The Clerk shall prepare and issue bills for combined
service accounts on or before the first day of each month.



2.   Bills Payable.  Bills for combined service accounts shall be due and
payable at the office of the Clerk by the fifteenth (15th) day of each month.



3.   Administrative Charge.  Bills not paid when due shall be considered
delinquent.  An administrative charge of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be added
to each delinquent bill.  The administrative charge shall be waived one time
per year for each customer.



4.   Adjustments.  No adjustments shall be made for any discrepancies
found in any utility billing after one year from the date of billing.



92.05       DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.



1.   If the delinquent bill is not paid by the twentieth (20th) of the
month in which due, a final reminder notice will be issued to the customer in
whose name the delinquent charges were incurred.  The reminder notice shall
specify that the date of discontinuance of service will be the tenth (10th)
of the following month and afford the customer an opportunity to request a
hearing within four (4) days from the date of the notice.




   On the 7th day of the month following a final reminder notice as
provided for herein, the City of Mt. Vernon may, in its sole discretion,
place a door hanger or other reminder in similar form at the address of any
customer with a delinquent water service bill.  A charge of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) will be assessed against the customer for the second
occurrence in any calendar year and any subsequent occurrence in that year.
The reminder will remind the customer that water service will be discontinued
on the 10th of that same month if the water service bill is not paid. The
charge will be added to the following month's water service bill and shall be
a lien on the property if not paid per Section 92.06.  The door hanger or
other similar reminder is not required as a condition to discontinue service
and the failure of the City to provide a door hanger or other similar
reminder is not a defense to discontinuance of service.




2.   A fifty dollar ($50.00) administrative fee shall be charged for
turning water back on after a disconnect.  The administrative fee shall
apply to reconnects during normal business hours, 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.,
Monday through Friday (excluding holidays).  If the reconnect is asked for
after these hours, or during a holiday, an additional administrative fee
shall be charged commensurate with the hourly rate paid to the City employee
for overtime hour charges incurred.



3.   A hearing on discontinuance of service will be conducted in
accordance with procedures established by the City Administrator.



4.   In addition to discontinuance of service, the City may initiate
outside collection efforts of delinquent accounts and reserves the right to
use all other legal remedies for collection of delinquent accounts.



5.   IIf a delinquent amount is owed by an account holder for a utility
service associated with a prior property or premises, the City may withhold
service from such account holder at any new property or premises until such
time as the account holder pays the delinquent amount owed.



92.06       LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.



The owner of the premises served and any lessee or tenant thereof shall be
jointly and severally liable for water service charges to the premises. 



1.    Water service charges remaining unpaid and delinquent shall
constitute a lien upon the premises served and shall be certified by the
Clerk to the County Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property
taxes. 



2.    For the purposes of this chapter, a buyer of property as equitable
title holder on contract shall be considered the owner of the premises. 
When the contract seller as legal title holder forecloses on the contract,
the contract seller and the contract buyer are both considered owners of the
premises and shall be jointly and severally liable for water service charges
to the premises incurred prior to the foreclosure.



92.07       LIEN EXEMPTION.



The lien for nonpayment shall not apply to a residential rental property
where water service is separately metered and the rates or charges for the
water service are paid directly to the City by the tenant, if the landlord
gives written notice to the City that the property is residential rental
property and that the tenant is liable for the rates or charges.  The City
may require a deposit not exceeding the usual cost of ninety (90) days of
water service be paid to the City.  The landlord's written notice shall
contain the name of the tenant responsible for charges, the address of the
rental property and the date of occupancy.  A change in tenant shall require
a new written notice to be given to the City within thirty (30) business days
of the change in tenant.  When the tenant moves from the rental property,
the City shall refund the deposit if the water service charges are paid in
full.  A change in the ownership of the residential rental property shall
require written notice of such change to be given to the City within ten (10)
business days of the completion of the change of ownership.  The lien
exemption does not apply to delinquent charges for repairs to a water service.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



92.08       LIEN NOTICE.



A lien for delinquent water service charges shall not be certified to the
County Treasurer unless prior written notice of intent to certify a lien is
given to the customer in whose name the delinquent charges were incurred. 
If the customer is a tenant and if the owner or landlord of the property has
made a written request for notice, the notice shall also be given to the
owner or landlord.  The notice shall be sent to the appropriate persons by
ordinary mail not less than thirty (30) days prior to certification of the
lien to the County Treasurer.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



92.09       CUSTOMER DEPOSITS.



There shall be required from every customer not the owner of the premises
served a one hundred dollar ($100.00) deposit intended to guarantee the
payment of bills for service.  The original amount of the deposit will be
refunded to the customer or credited to the customer's account after
twenty-four (24) months of continued service so long as during this
twenty-four (24) month period there has been no notice of delinquency sent to
the customer.  This requirement shall not be enforced against prior owners
of homes in Mount Vernon who move from their homes (in Mount Vernon) to an
apartment or other residence that would normally require a deposit, as long
as during the previous twenty-four (24) months of continuous service there
had been no notice of delinquency sent.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



92.10       FEE FOR REQUESTED SHUT OFF.



Except in the event of an emergency, or during normal working hours, there
shall be a fee charged, in an amount to be determined by the City, for
turning off water at the curb stop at the customer’s request.



92.11    REDUCTION IN BILLS FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICE 



1.   A reduction in the water and sewer portion of a customer's utility
bill shall be granted only on the following terms and conditions:



A.   Extraordinary water and sewer usage which results in a utility bill
for which a reduction is sought must stem from mechanical failure which is
not caused by the customer or an occupant of the affected property.



B.   The mechanical failure must be repaired by the customer within
fourteen (14) days of its discovery or receipt of notification by the City of
the extraordinary usage, whichever is earlier.



For purposes of this ordinance, mechanical failures occur when a component no
longer meets performance specifications. Mechanical failures can include
deformation, yielding, crack initiation, excessive spalling, corrosion,
extreme environmental conditions, etc. (i.e. water line breaks, internal
component failures in toilets, water heater failures) Items that are not
considered mechanical failures include leaving the faucet running, irrigating
lawns, or any other operational failure caused by the owner and/or tenant.



C.   No adjustment shall be made unless the water consumed in the month of
extraordinary use exceeds 150% the customer's average monthly usage. Average
monthly usage for the purposes of this section shall be calculated utilizing
a one year rolling average of the volume of water used by the customer.



D.   Any reduction shall be limited to the three monthly billing periods
preceding the date that the repairs are made to the customer's plumbing
system.



E.   All requests for an adjustment must be made an a form provided by the
City with required attachments and presented to the City Clerk within
fourteen (14) days after the completion of repairs. The City Administrator
shall grant or deny the application for reduction and notify the customer by
ordinary mail of this decision and the amount owed. The customer may appeal
the Administrator's decision to the City Council by written request mailed or
delivered to the City Clerk within 10 days of the date of the Administrator's
notice to the customer. The appeal will be placed on the City Council's
agenda as soon as practical and the City Clerk shall notify the customer by
ordinary mail of the date of hearing at least five (5) days prior to the date
of the hearing.



2.   In the event that the customer demonstrates qualification for a
reduction in the customer's utility charges under the foregoing guidelines,
and is granted a reduction by the City Administrator or the City Council on
appeal, then water and sewer portion the monthly utility bill for which
reduction is sought shall be reduced by 25% with such reduction being
provided to the customer as a credit toward the customer's next monthly bill
issued after City Administrator or City Council's decision.

93.03  Appeal and Adjustment
 
93.06  Exceptions to Water Conservation




93.01   WATER SHORTAGES.




During and following drought conditions which may occur from time to time,
the supply of water available to the City may become significantly and
seriously depleted so that there will not then be a sufficient supply of
water to meet the customary and usual demand indefinitely.  Under those
conditions, the Council may find and declare, by resolution, a public
emergency water shortage, during which time it may require any or all of the
water conservation methods set forth in Section 93.02 of this chapter for the
purpose of producing an orderly and equitable curtailment of water
consumption until, by resolution, the Council finds and declares the water
shortage emergency to be ended.  The Council may specifically authorize by
resolution any of the water conservation measures set forth in Section 93.02
and may authorize the Mayor to designate by proclamation which water
conservation measures shall apply.



93.02       WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES.



The Council, by resolution, or the Mayor, by proclamation, if authorized, may
select from among the following water conservation measures:



1.    There may be voluntary water usage restrictions on the following
activities:



A.    Watering of established residential lawns, gardens, plants, trees or
shrubs, including but not limited to a total ban on such watering,
alternative day watering or watering limited to, but not more than, a certain
amount of watering within a certain specified period of time, or within a
particular time frame.  In this connection, if circumstances so permit,
restrictions may also be varied as between lawns, gardens, plants, trees and
shrubs and restrictions may be varied as between established lawns and
plantings, as compared to new seeding or sod, or new plantings.  The newly
planted lawns, gardens, seedings, sod and plantings may be exempt for a
period of five (5) weeks.



B.    Residential swimming pool filling.



C.    Residential vehicle washing.




D.    All inside residential water usage which is not absolutely necessary.





E.    All commercial water usage which is not absolutely necessary.





F.    Requested timing adjustments (hours of the day and/or alternative
days) for all of the items listed above.




G.    Water served at restaurants.




H.    Washing the streets, parking lots, driveways and sidewalks.




I.    Ornamental fountains.



J.    Hydrant flushing.



K.    Washing the outside of buildings.



L.    Nonessential construction water usage.




M.    Public entity (City, County, School) nonessential water usage.




2.   There may be involuntary required water usage restrictions or
complete prohibitions against the following activities:



A.    Established residential lawns, gardens, plants, shrubs and trees.



B.    Newly planted (less than 5 weeks) residential lawns, gardens,
plants, shrubs and trees.



C.    Residential swimming pool filling, private swimming pools,
children’s wading pools or any other indoor or outdoor pool of any kind or
description.



D.    Residential vehicle washing.



E.    Commercial vehicle washing establishments.



F.    Public entity (City, County, School) nonessential water usage.



G.    Time restrictions (hours of the day and/or days of the week) for any
and all of the items listed above.



H.    Water served at restaurants.



I.    Washing streets, parking lots, driveways or sidewalks.



J.    Ornamental fountains.



K.    Hydrant flushing.

M.    Construction water usage.



N.    Tankload water sales by City.



O.    Temporary water rate surcharge to curb use.



3.   Each customer may be required to achieve a particular percentage
reduction in water usage as compared to a prior period usage and be subject
to the payment of a premium rate over and above the normal rate in the event
such percentage reduction is not achieved.  The amount of percentage
reduction and the base period for comparison purposes shall be established by
resolution or proclamation as previously set forth.  The premium rate shall
be as set forth in Section 93.04 of this chapter.



4.   The Council, but not the Mayor, may set a base allocation for every
customer of the City’s water system, and if the consumption of a particular
customer exceeds the base allocation, that customer shall pay, in addition to
the regular rate for water consumption, the premium rate set forth in Section
93.04 for unrestrained consumption.



93.03       APPEAL AND ADJUSTMENT.



1.   Base Allocation.  In the event that the Council establishes a base
allocation by resolution, any customer of the City’s water system may file
an appeal with the Council to adjust the base allocation amount.  The
Council may grant an adjustment to the appellant based on the following
criteria:



A.    For single family residential use, the base allocation may be
increased to 200 cubic feet per person per billing period for all individuals
residing at the appellant’s residence for a period of more than 30 days.



B.    For commercial, industrial, institutional or other residential use,
the base allocation may be increased based upon facts appropriate to the
individual customer as, for example, the average of the water bill during the
previous winter (November through April), production, service, or occupancy
data provided by the customer.




2.   Premium Rate Charges.  Any customer may file for adjustment of the
premium rate charges for unrestrained water consumption with the Council. 
The Council may grant an adjustment of the premium rate charges in accordance
with the following criteria:



A.    The cause of the high consumption must be mechanical in nature (such
as broken or leaky pipes or fixtures) rather than human carelessness or
apparent disregard of this chapter.



B.    The customer shall furnish proof that the mechanical failure was
repaired promptly.  This should be in the form of a licensed plumber’s
invoice or statement or a materials receipt.



C.    The adjustment may be granted only for the billing period prior to
the correction of the failure.



D.    For those accounts granted an adjustment of the premium rate
charges, the minimum adjusted premium rate shall be a surcharge of ten
percent (10%) of the normal rate in addition to the normal rate charged to
the customer.



93.04       PREMIUM RATE.



At such times as there may be restrictions on consumption which if violated
give rise to a premium rate, the premium rate shall be a ten percent (10%)
surcharge of the normal customer consumption rate in addition to the normal
rate charged to the customer.



93.05       REDUCTION IN FLOW OF WATER TO ANY CUSTOMER.



The Council is authorized, after giving notice and opportunity for hearing,
to reduce the flow of water to any customer determined to be using water in
any manner not in accordance with this chapter or a resolution or
proclamation issued pursuant to Section 93.02.



93.06       EXCEPTIONS TO WATER CONSERVATION.



Water reclaimed or recycled after some primary use, such as water that has
been used for washing or cooling, may be used without restriction. 
Additionally, water derived from sources other than from the City, such as
water condensed from the atmosphere by air conditioners or collected from
rain or snow, may be used without restriction.

94.01   PURPOSE.



The purpose of this chapter is to institute land use regulations and
restrictions to protect the City's water supply and well fields, restrict the
location of potential sources of contamination in close proximity to a public
water supply as required by Iowa Administrative Code Section
567-43.3(7)(455B), and to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the City.



94.02   REGULATION.



No structure, facility or use of the type enumerated in Iowa Administrative
Code Section 567-43.3(7)(455B) shall be constructed, located or maintained
within the distances set forth in Table A from a public water well in Mount
Vernon, Iowa.



94.03   EXISTING USES.



The use of structures or facilities existing at the time of the adoption of
the ordinance codified in this chapter may be continued even though such use
may not conform with the regulations of this chapter.  However, such
structure or facility may not be enlarged, extended, reconstructed or
substituted subsequent to adoption of said ordinance unless an exemption is
granted by the City Council.



94.04   INSPECTIONS.



1.   The wellhead protection officer or inspector shall have the power and
authority to enter and inspect all buildings, structures and land field zones
of influence for the purpose of making an inspection.  Failure of a person
having common authority over a property to permit an inspection shall be
sufficient grounds and probable cause for a court of competent jurisdiction
to issue a search warrant to the protection officer to inspect such premises.



2.   In the event a building or structure appears to be vacant or
abandoned, and the owner cannot be readily contacted in order to obtain
consent for an inspection, the officer or inspector may enter into or upon
any open or unsecured portion of the premises in order to conduct an
inspection thereof.



3.   The wellhead protection officer or inspector may inspect each well
field annually and shall maintain an inventory, if applicable, of all
hazardous substances which exist in each well field zone.  An emergency plan
shall be prepared and filed with the County Emergency Management Agency
indicating the procedures which will be followed in the event of spillage of
a regulated substance so as to control and collect all such spilled materials.



4.   It shall be the duty of all law enforcement officers to assist in
making inspection when such assistance is required by the officer or
inspector.



94.05   TRANSFER OF PROPERTY.



The City requires that all abandoned wells and cisterns be properly sealed
prior to finalization of property sales or transfers within the corporate
limits of the City.



94.06   BUILDING PERMIT ISSUANCE.



No building permits shall be issued which are a violation of this chapter or
a source of contamination for a City well, and no building permits shall be
issued which are a violation of the Iowa DNR Separation Distances From
Wells. 



94.07   CITY ACTION FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.



If any person who engages in nonresidential activities stores, handles, uses
and/or produces toxic substances within the wellhead protection zones as
indicated on the wellhead protection zone maps, continues to operate in
violation of the provisions of this chapter, then the City may file an action
for injunctive relief in the court of jurisdiction.  This section is not
intended to limit the remedies available to the City.



94.08   NOTICE OF VIOLATION.



Whenever an officer or an inspector determines that there is a violation of
this chapter, said officer or inspector shall give notice thereof, which
notice shall:



1.   Be in writing;



2.   Be dated and signed by the officer or inspector;



3.   Specify the violation or violations;



4.   State that the violation(s) shall be corrected within a specified
period of time as issued in writing by the inspector. 



94.09   WELLHEAD PROTECTION OFFICER DESIGNATED. 



The Water Superintendent is designated as the wellhead protection officer
unless another person is specifically designated by the Council to supervise
the implementation and enforcement of this chapter.

1          Deep and shallow wells, as defined in 567-40.2(455B):  A
deep well is a well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a
continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock at least 5 feet thick
located at least 25 feet below the normal ground surface and above the
aquifer from which water is to be drawn.  A shallow well is a well located
and constructed in such a manner that there is not a continuous layer of low
permeability soil or rock (or equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to
the department) at least 5 feet thick, the top of which is located at least
25 feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which
water is to be drawn.
2          The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: 
the type of piping that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the
table, and that the piping was properly installed in accordance with the
standards.
3          Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or
wastewater.  Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes
may be land-applied within the separation distance on an individual,
case-by-case basis.
4          Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar
discarded solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such
materials resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic
activities.

the connection process will be charged back to the applicant at the
applicable labor rates and be reimbursed back to the City.





(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)




96.03       PLUMBER REQUIRED.



All installations of building sewers and connections to the public sewer
shall be made by a plumber approved by the City.  The City Administrator
shall have the power to suspend the approval of any plumber for violation of
any of the provisions of these Sanitary Sewer chapters; a suspension, unless
revoked, shall continue until the next regular meeting of the Council.  The
City Administrator shall notify the plumber immediately by personal written
notice of the suspension, the reasons for the suspension, and the time and
place of the Council meeting at which the plumber will be granted a
hearing.  At this Council meeting the City Administrator shall make a
written report to the Council stating the reasons for the suspension, and the
Council, after fair hearing, shall affirm or revoke the suspension or take
any further action that is necessary and proper.  The plumber shall provide
a surety bond in the minimum sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) secured
by a responsible surety bonding company authorized to operate within the
State, conditioned to indemnify and save the City harmless against all losses
or damages that may arise from or be occasioned by the making of connections
with the public sewers or excavations therefor or by carelessness, negligence
or unskillfulness in making the same.  Such bond shall remain in force and
must be executed for a period of one year except that on such expiration it
shall remain in force as to all penalties, claims and demands that may have
accrued thereunder prior to such expiration.  In lieu of a surety bond, a
cash deposit of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) may be filed with the City.



96.04       EXCAVATIONS.



All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be
open trench work unless otherwise approved by the City.  Pipe laying and
backfill shall be performed in accordance with A.S.T.M. (American Society for
Testing and Materials) Specification C-12, except that no backfill shall be
placed until the work has been inspected.  The excavations shall be made in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 135 where applicable.



96.05       CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS.



Any connection with a public sanitary sewer must be made under the direct
supervision of the Superintendent and in accordance with the following:



1.   Old Building Sewers.  Old building sewers may be used in connection
with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test
conducted by the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all
requirements of this chapter.



2.   Separate Building Sewers.  A separate and independent building sewer
shall be provided for every occupied building; except where one building
stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is
available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining
alley, court, yard, or driveway.  In such cases the building sewer from the
front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered
as one building sewer.



3.   Installation.  The installation of the building sewer and its
connection into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of
Division 4, Plumbing Rules and Regulations, of the State Building Code,
applicable rules and regulations of the City, or the procedures set forth in
A.S.T.M. Specification C-12.  All such connections shall be made gastight
and watertight.  Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials
must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.  All connections
shall include the installation of a backflow valve.



4.   Water Lines.  When possible, building sewers should be laid at least
ten (10) feet horizontally from a water service.  The horizontal separation
may be less, provided the water service line is located at one side and at
least twelve (12) inches above the top of the building sewer. 



5.   Size.  Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage
flow from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four (4) inches.



6.   Alignment and Grade.  All building sewers shall be laid to a
straight line to meet the following: 



A.   Recommended grade of one-fourth (¼) inch per foot. 



B.   Minimum grade of one-eighth (1/8) inch per foot. 



C.   Minimum velocity: 2.00 feet per second with the sewer half full.



D.   Deviations: any deviation in alignment or grade shall be made only
with the written approval of the Superintendent and shall be made only with
approved fittings. 



7.   Depth.  Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to
the building at an elevation below the basement floor.  The depth of cover
above the sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.



8.   Sewage Lifts.  In all buildings in which any building drain is too
low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by
such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer.



9.   Pipe Specifications.  Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws,
splits, or breaks.  Materials shall be as specified in Division 4 of the
State Building Code except that the building sewer pipe, from the property
line to the public sewer, shall comply with the current edition of one of the
following:



A.   Clay sewer pipe - A.S.T.M. C-700 (extra strength).



B.   Extra heavy cast iron soil pipe - A.S.T.M. A-74. 



C.   Ductile iron water pipe - A.W.W.A. C-151.

within three (3) feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. 



11.   Jointing.  Fittings, type of joint, and jointing material shall be
compatible with the type of pipe used, subject to the approval of the
Superintendent.  Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.



12.   Unstable Soil.  No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is
exposed when crossing any watercourse.  Where an old watercourse must of
necessity be crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or
settlement, cast iron soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly
encased in concrete shall be required for such crossings.  Such encasement
shall extend at least six (6) inches on all sides of the pipe.  The cast
iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on firm, solid material at either
end. 



13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space.  No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent
to the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled.  The
backfill shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from
the foundation.  Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the
first floor is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be
plugged and the plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent.  Any
accumulation of water in any excavation or basement during construction and
prior to connection to the sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other
than draining into the sanitary sewer. 



96.06       SEWER TAP.



Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the
“Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location.  If no
properly located “Y” branch is available, a “Y” saddle shall be
installed at the location specified by the Superintendent.  The public sewer
shall be tapped with a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type
of public sewer shall be glued and attached with stainless steel clamps to
the sewer.  At no time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter
a maintenance hole unless special written permission is received from the
Superintendent and in accordance with the Superintendent’s direction if
such connection is approved.



96.07       INTERCEPTORS OR TRAPS REQUIRED.



Grease, oil, sludge and sand interceptors or grease traps shall be provided
by gas and service stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages,
restaurants, cafeterias, school kitchens and other facilities when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
such wastes that contain grease in excessive amounts or any flammable waste,
sand or other harmful ingredients.  Such interceptors or traps shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units.  When required, such
interceptors or traps shall be installed in accordance with the following:



1.   Design and Location.  All interceptors or traps shall be of a type
and capacity as provided by the Iowa Public Health Bulletin and Division 4 of
the State Building Code, to be approved by the Superintendent, and shall be
located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.



2.   Construction Standards.  The interceptors or traps shall be
constructed of impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme
changes in temperature.  They shall be of substantial construction,
watertight and equipped with easily removable covers that shall be gastight
and watertight.

the owner at the owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously
efficient operations at all times.



96.08       INSPECTION REQUIRED.



All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent.  As soon as all
pipe work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed,
and before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and
the Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and
material; no sewer pipe laid under ground shall be covered or trenches filled
until after the sewer has been so inspected and approved.  If the
Superintendent refuses to approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed
immediately to correct the work.



96.09       PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.



All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner.  The owner
shall indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or
indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.



96.10       ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.



Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which
construction or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of
this chapter, shall be corrected, at the owner’s expense, within thirty
(30) days after date of official notice from the Council of such violation. 
If not made within such time the Council shall, in addition to the other
penalties herein provided, have the right to finish and correct the work and
assess the cost thereof to the property owner.  Such assessment shall be
collected with and in the same manner as general property taxes.

taste or odor producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits
which may be established by the Superintendent as necessary, after treatment
of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of state, federal, or other
public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.



8.   Radioactive Wastes.  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such
half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the
Superintendent in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations. 



9.   Excess Alkalinity.  Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of
9.5. 



10.   Unusual Wastes.  Materials which exert or cause: 



A.   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not
limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of dissolved
solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate).



B.   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions).



C.   Unusual C.B.O.D., chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works.



D.   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
“slugs” as defined herein. 



11.   Noxious or Malodorous Gases.  Any noxious or malodorous gas or
other substance which either singly or by interaction with other wastes is
capable of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or of preventing
entry into sewers for their maintenance and repair. 



12.   Damaging Substances.  Any waters, wastes, materials or substances
which react with water or wastes in the sewer system to release noxious
gases, develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in
objectionable concentration or create any other condition deleterious to
structures and treatment processes. 



13.   Untreatable Wastes.  Waters or wastes containing substances which
are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies
having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.



97.05       RESTRICTED DISCHARGES - POWERS.



If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section 97.04 and which in the judgment of the
Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works,
processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard
to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:



1.   Rejection.  Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the
public sewage system;



2.   Pretreatment.  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers; 



3.   Controls Imposed.  Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or 



4.   Special Charges.  Require payment to cover the added cost of
handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer
charges under the provisions of Chapter 99.



97.06       SPECIAL FACILITIES.



If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.  Where
preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any
waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at the owner’s expense.



97.07       CONTROL MAINTENANCE HOLES.



When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
maintenance hole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances
in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of
the wastes.  Such maintenance hole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent.  The maintenance hole shall be installed by the owner at
the owner’s expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe
and accessible at all times.



97.08       TESTING OF WASTES.



All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association,
and shall be determined at the control maintenance hole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at said control maintenance hole.  In the event that
no special maintenance hole has been required, the control maintenance hole
shall be considered to be the nearest downstream maintenance hole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the
effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence
of hazards to life, limb, and property.  (The particular analyses involved
will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be
taken.  Normally, but not always, C.B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s
are determined from periodic grab samples).

99.06  Lien for Nonpayment


99.03  Special Rates
 
99.07  Special Agreements Permitted


99.04  Private Water Systems
 




99.01   SEWER SERVICE CHARGES REQUIRED.




Every customer shall pay to the City sewer service fees as hereinafter
provided.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



99.02       RATE.



Effective July 1, 2009, each customer will pay sewer service charges in the
amount of $34.22 per 1000 cubic feet of water attributable to the customer
for the property served but in no event less than $7.51 per month (a 10%
increase over the previous rate of $6.83).  Beginning on July 1, 2009 and
then on July 1 of each succeeding year until June 30, 2024, the sewer service
charge will increase 3% and the minimum charge will be increased by 3%.  In
any fiscal year in which revenues are expected to exceed operations and
maintenance expenditures by 25% the Council, by resolution, shall suspend the
rate increase, in whole or in part, so long as revenues exceed operations and
maintenance expenditures by 25%.



In addition, there will be a flat fee of $10.00 per month per residential
dwelling unit and a flat fee of $10.00 per month for each non-residential
account for the purpose of payment for an upgrade to the sewer system for the
benefit of all users.  A residential dwelling unit is defined as one or more
rooms, designed, occupied or intended for occupancy as a separate living
quarter.  For purposes of this section, each apartment, dormitory room,
condominium or similar dwelling usage will be considered a separate dwelling
unit.



Customers who are educational institutions with more than 250 full-time
students are exempt from the sewer service charges based on the water usage
for the portion of water service:



1.   Used exclusively for watering or irrigating playing fields of the
educational institution; and



2.   Measured by a meter that is separate and distinct from the meters
used to measure other water services provided to the customer.



The customer is responsible for all costs associated with the purchase,
installation and maintenance of the meter.  The Superintendent shall
determine the type and size of the meter and, further, shall inspect and
approve the installation of the meter so used.  The customer's eligibility
for this exemption is contingent upon full compliance with these and other
provisions pertaining to the water system and the sanitary sewer system, as
determined by the Superintendent. 



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



99.03   SPECIAL RATES.



Where, in the judgment of the Superintendent and the Council, special
conditions exist to the extent that the application of the sewer charges
provided in Section 99.02 would be inequitable or unfair to either the City
or the customer, a special rate shall be proposed by the Superintendent and
submitted to the Council for approval by resolution.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



99.04       PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS.



Customers whose premises are served by a private water system shall pay sewer
charges based upon the water used as determined by the City either by an
estimate agreed to by the customer or by metering the water system at the
customer’s expense.  Any negotiated, or agreed upon sales or charges shall
be subject to approval of the Council.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



99.05       PAYMENT OF BILLS.



All sewer service charges are due and payable under the same terms and
conditions provided for payment of a combined service account as contained in
Section 92.04 of this Code of Ordinances.  Sewer service may be discontinued
in accordance with the provisions contained in Section 92.05 if the combined
service account becomes delinquent, and the provisions contained in Section
92.08 relating to lien notices shall also apply in the event of a delinquent
account.



99.06   LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.



The owner of the premises served and any lessee or tenant thereof shall be
jointly and severally liable for sewer service charges to the premises. 
Sewer service charges remaining unpaid and delinquent shall constitute a lien
upon the premises served and shall be certified by the Clerk to the County
Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property taxes.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)



99.07       SPECIAL AGREEMENTS PERMITTED.



No statement in these chapters shall be construed as preventing a special
agreement, arrangement or contract between the Council, and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted subject to special conditions, rate and cost as established by the
Council.

100.01      PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.




1.   The purpose of this chapter is to establish the Storm Water Utility;
authorize charges, rates and fees for use of, and discharge to, the public
storm and surface water drainage system; to provide a process for appeals
from certain decisions of the Council relating to such charges; and to
provide for collection of delinquent charges.



2.   The Council finds that the construction, operation and maintenance of
the City's storm water system should, in part, be funded through user charges
imposed for the discharge of storm and surface water to the storm water
drainage system, thereby charging those persons and activities using or
receiving service from that system.



3.   The City may be required to provide increased quantity or quality
controls to mitigate those impacts of pollutants from discharging storm and
surface waters into the storm water system.  Therefore, it is appropriate to
impose a storm and surface water user charge upon all users of property which
may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the storm water system.



100.02      DEFINITIONS.



The following words shall have the following definitions when used in this
chapter, and any resolution and order adopted pursuant hereto, unless the
context requires otherwise or unless such word is expressly defined otherwise:



1.   "Connection" means the physical act or process of directing or
allowing the flow of storm and surface waters to the storm sewer or drainage
line, or joining onto an existing side sewer, for the purpose of connecting
private impervious surface or other storm and surface water sources or
systems to the public storm and surface water system.  It also includes
creation or maintenance of impervious surface that causes or is likely to
cause an increase in the quantity or decrease in quality or both from the
natural state of storm water runoff, and which drains, directly or
indirectly, to the storm and surface water system.



2.   "Date of imposition" or "imposition date" means the first day of each
month or such other date designated by the Council at which time a charge is
imposed and becomes the legal obligation of the user.  The obligation may
include the cost of services to be provided during the billing period or for
services previously provided to the same person under this chapter.



3.   "Days" means calendar days unless otherwise specified.



4.   "Equivalent residential unit" or "ERU" means a measurement unit based
on the surface area of an average improved single-family dwelling lot or
parcel within the City (as determined by a statistical sampling performed by
the City).  Except as provided otherwise, one equivalent service unit shall
be deemed to be 15,000 square feet.



5.   "Impervious surface area" means all land area that has been altered
from its natural state such that it does not allow the infiltration and
retention of water equivalent to that of undisturbed soil.  This includes,
but is not limited to:  pavement, buildings, decks, parking areas, and
compacted gravel areas.  "Impervious surface" does not include improved
streets, roads and sidewalks within the public right-of-way; bike paths;
railroad beds or quarry excavation areas and temporary service roads in the
excavation areas.  Rather such facilities are deemed to be part of the
public surface water drainage conveyance system or to constitute
non-impervious surfaces.



6.   "Multi-family dwelling unit" means a residential unit located within
a building that accommodates more than one (1) residential living unit and in
which each residential living unit shall have a separate water meter.



7.   "Occupant" means the person residing or doing business on the
property.  In a family or household situation, the occupants responsible for
the obligation herein imposed are the adult heads of the household, jointly
and severally.  In a dwelling or office sharing situation, the adult
occupant legally responsible for the management or condition of the property
shall be responsible.



8.   "Other developed user" means any parcel, lot or property other than a
single-family dwelling unit or a multi-family dwelling unit.



9.   "Owner" means the legal owner(s) of record as shown on the tax rolls
of Linn County, or where there is a recorded land sale contract, the
purchaser thereunder.



10.   "Person" means any individual, public or private corporation,
political subdivision, governmental agency, municipality, partnership,
association, trust, or any other legal entity whatsoever.



11.   "Rule" means any written standard, directive, interpretation,
policy, regulation, procedure or other provision, adopted by the Council as a
resolution and order to carry out the provisions of this chapter.



12.   "Single-family dwelling unit" means a lot or parcel on which a
single-family dwelling or a duplex with a single water meter exists at any
time as the imposition of the charge.



13.   "Storm and surface water drainage system" means any combination of
publicly owned storm and surface water quantity and quality facilities,
pumping, or lift facilities, storm and secondary drain pipes and culverts,
open channels, creeks, ditches and rivers, force mains, laterals, manholes,
catch basins and inlets, including the grates and covers thereof, detention
and other retention facilities, laboratory facilities and equipment, and any
other publicly owned facilities for the collection, conveyance, treatment and
disposal of storm and surface water within the City, to which sanitary sewage
flows are not intentionally admitted.



14.   "Student" means each individual enrolled at the beginning of the
school year at Cornell College and living in college provided housing not
charged as a residential unit.



15.   "User" means any person who uses property which maintains connection
to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the City for surface
water management.  The occupant of occupied property is deemed the user. 
If the property is not occupied, the person who has the right to occupy it
shall be deemed the user.



100.03      STORM WATER UTILITY ESTABLISHED.



Pursuant to the authority of Section 384.84 of the Code of Iowa, as amended,
the Council hereby establishes a storm water utility in the City.  The
entire City, as increased from time to time, shall constitute a single storm
and surface water drainage system district.  The provisions of this chapter
shall become effective on June 1, 2004.



100.04      CHARGES AND FEES IN GENERAL.



The Council may adopt by rule charges, rates, and fees for the use of the
City's storm and surface water system, and for services provided by the City
relating to that system.  Such rules may include delinquency and interest
charges and penalties.  Such charges and fees shall be just and equitable
based upon the actual costs of operation, maintenance, acquisition, extension
and replacement of the City's system, the costs of bond repayment,
regulation, administration, and services of the City. Except as specifically
provided in this chapter or by resolution and order, all charges and service
fees shall be due and payable in advance of provision of service.  All
billing procedures shall be the same as for water usage and may be billed on
the same bill, as part of a combined service account, which means a customer
service account for two or more utility services.



1.   Service Charge.  Each customer shall pay for public storm water
drainage:




A.   $3.00 per month per equivalent residential unit or (ERU);
or 





B.   $1.25 per student in residence as defined in this chapter. 
Effective July 1, 2014, the charge per student in residence as defined in
this chapter increases to $1.50.




2.   The City may from time to time amend this chapter to change the
amount of rates to be charged for the Storm Water Drainage System.



100.05      STORM WATER UTILITY USER  CHARGE.



1.   There is hereby established a storm water utility system user
charge.  This charge hereby is imposed on every user within the City of the
storm and surface water drainage system on the imposition date.  The charge
may be required to be paid in advance of the provision of service for the
billing period.  The charge due for the billing period shall be the
obligation of the user of the public storm system on the imposition date,
notwithstanding whether the user is the addressee of the bill.



2.   The charge shall be the personal obligation of the user on the
imposition date, regardless of whether that person has any ownership interest
in the property.  This charge shall constitute a debt due the City as of the
date of imposition.



3.   Any person who has paid the full amount due in advance of receiving
service shall be entitled to a refund if the person ceases to be the user. 
The refund shall be effective on the date the property is vacated or sold and
based on the number of days remaining in the billing period.  The refund is
waived unless a written request for refund is filed within thirty (30) days
of vacating or selling the property.  The request shall include
documentation reasonably deemed adequate by the City.  Notwithstanding any
other provision, the new user shall be responsible for the remaining balance
of the service charge, which may be billed immediately or added to the bill
for the next period.



4.   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the real
property, as shown in the records of the County Assessor, is the occupant.



5.   The storm water utility user charge shall be imposed upon any person
who uses or discharges to the public storm and surface water drainage system
by:



A.   Maintaining impervious surface connected to (directly or indirectly)
and capable of discharge to the public surface water management systems; or



B.   Actually discharging storm or surface water into the system; or



C.   Making a specific request for storm and surface water management
service.



Said charge shall be charged for all users of properties within the
boundaries of the City.  A property, whether unimproved or containing
impervious surface, is presumed to discharge storm water to the storm and
surface water drainage system, and to generate a demand for storm and surface
water drainage services.



100.06      CALCULATION OF EQUIVALENT UNITS AND AMOUNT OF CHARGE.



This section shall be used to determine the number of equivalent residential
units (ERUs) for a property for purposes of determining the amount of the
storm water utility (SWU) service charges.



1.   Single-family residential dwelling units shall be charged at a rate
of one (1) ERU per water meter.



2.   Multi-family residential dwelling units shall be charged at the rate
of one (1) ERU per water meter or one (1) per dwelling unit, whichever is
larger.



3.   Each student in residence shall be charged at the student rate and
shall be paid monthly by Cornell College.  The number of students in
residence at the beginning of the school year shall be used throughout the
entire calendar year to calculate the monthly charge.



4.   Each water service registered to Cornell College shall be charged as
one (1) ERU.



5.   Other developed users shall be charged at a rate of the number of
ERU's for the property.  The ERU shall be calculated based on the size of
the property in square feet divided by 15,000 square feet and rounded to the
nearest whole number.



6.   Any agricultural use of land or other user that does not have a water
account with the City shall be considered exempt from the storm water utility
(SWU) service charges.



7.   Golf Courses.  One acre of a golf course shall be charged at the
rate pursuant to the formula set in paragraph 5.  The remainder of the golf
course shall be charged at 25% of the rate calculated using the formula set
out in paragraph number 5 of this section.



100.07      ADJUSTMENT OF EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT DETERMINATION.



Any other developed user may request an adjustment of the storm water utility
service charge.



1.   The request for adjustment shall be submitted to the City in writing
on forms provided by the City requesting an adjustment of the applicable
number of equivalent residential units.



2.   The request for adjustment shall be submitted within ninety (90) days
of the receipt of the first billing of the storm water utility service charge
to that user.



3.   Any request for adjustment shall include sufficient documentation to
allow the City to determine from the documentation provided the total surface
area.



4.   Within twenty (20) days after receipt of the request for adjustment,
the City shall review the adjustment.  If the City determines the total area
is different than the area used for the basis of charge, the parcel shall be
recharged at the revised rate.  The City shall adjust for any previous
payments.  If the City determines there is insufficient information to
complete the evaluation, the City shall notify the applicant and request
additional information.



5.   If the City requests additional information, the applicant shall
submit additional information within twenty (20) days after the determination
by the City.  If additional information is not submitted within twenty (20)
days, the request for the adjustment shall be considered to have been
withdrawn.



100.08      BILLING.



1.   The City shall send a bill for the amount due by regular mail to
every user in the City.  Mailing to the user of record as shown in the City
water billing records shall satisfy this requirement.  The billing period
shall be the same as for water usage.



2.   The recipient has twenty (20) days from the billing date to file a
notice of non-occupancy.  The notice shall indicate the relationship of the
recipient to the property (e.g. owner, lessor, mortgagee), whether on the
imposition date the property was occupied, and if so, by whom.



3.   Upon receipt of the notice, the City shall determine who is obligated
for payment.  Based on this determination, the City shall:



A.   Issue a new bill to the occupant if the property was occupied by
someone other than the original recipient;



B.   Reissue the bill to the recipient if it is found that the person was
the occupant;



C.   Issue a bill to the owner as the user, if the property was not

charges and shall be recoverable in the same manner as are such charges.



9.   Where a lien against property can be imposed when the owner is
liable, it shall exist from the date the bill was last brought current in the
same manner as with a lien for water service.



100.10      REQUEST FOR SERVICE, DISCONNECTION FROM SERVICE,
TERMINATION OF USER CHARGES.



1.   The opening of a water billing account shall be deemed to be a
specific request for provision of storm and surface water service to that
property.



2.   Any user of the public storm water utility system may disconnect
property served by the system from service and terminate further user charges
by terminating an active water billing account to the property.

prejudice.



2.   Appeals. 



A.   The following may be appealed to the Council:

burning under this section shall be limited to areas at least one-quarter
(1/4) mile from any building inhabited by anyone other than the applicant or
any tenants of the applicant's property.  This separation requirement may be
waived by the owner of any building within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the
proposed burn site by signing and submitting a written waiver.  If any owner
of any building within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the proposed burn site does
not provide a written waiver, the application shall be denied.  All required
written waivers must be submitted with the application and are subject to
confirmation by the Fire Chief or the Fire Chief's designee.  If all

and approval by Council. Any burning under this section shall be limited to
areas at least one-quarter (1/4) mile from any building inhabited by anyone
other than the applicant or any tenants of the applicant's property.  This
separation requirement may be waived by the owner of any building within
one-quarter (1/4) mile of the proposed burn site by signing and submitting a
written waiver.  If any owner of any building within one-quarter (1/4) mile
of the proposed burn site does not provide a written waiver, the application
shall be denied.  All required written waivers must be submitted with the
application and are subject to confirmation by the Fire Chief or the Fire

the applicant must post notice and notify by mail all affected property
owners whose properties are within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the proposed

6.   Fees.  Permit fees for larger ceremonial burns, prairie burns and
tree and tree trimming burns shall be set by resolution of the City Council.



105.06       LITTERING PROHIBITED.



No person shall discard any litter onto or in any water or land, except that
nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authorized
collection and discarding of such litter in or on areas or receptacles
provided for such purpose.  When litter is discarded from a motor vehicle,
the driver of the motor vehicle shall be responsible for the act in any case
where doubt exists as to which occupant of the motor vehicle actually
discarded the litter.  A violation of this section is an environmental
violation and therefore a municipal infraction.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.363)



105.07       OPEN DUMPING PROHIBITED.



No person shall dump or deposit or permit the dumping or depositing of any
solid waste on the surface of the ground or into a body or stream of water at
any place other than a sanitary disposal project approved by the Director,
unless a special permit to dump or deposit solid waste on land owned or
leased by such person has been obtained from the Director.  However, this
section does not prohibit the use of dirt, stone, brick or similar inorganic
material for fill, landscaping, excavation, or grading at places other than a
sanitary disposal project.  A violation of this section is an environmental
violation and therefore a municipal infraction.



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.307 and IAC, 567-100.2)



105.08       TOXIC AND HAZARDOUS WASTE.

not limited to, poisons, pesticides, herbicides, acids, caustics,
pathological waste, flammable or explosive materials and similar harmful
waste which requires special handling and which must be disposed of in such a
manner as to conserve the environment and protect the public health and
safety.

franchise distribute to all consumers gas of good quality and shall furnish
uninterrupted service, except as interruptible service may be specifically

There is hereby imposed a franchise fee of one percent (1%) upon the gross

dwellings under common ownership, control, or management, unless such
facility uses any public right-of-way;

Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable
television, the City finds that the public health, safety and general welfare
can best be served by establishing certain regulatory powers in the City as
this chapter shall designate.  It is the intent of this chapter to provide
for the means to attain the best possible communication and developmental
results in the public interest and for such public purpose, in these
matters.  Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to
include these findings as an integral part thereof.



113.03       FRANCHISE TERRITORY.



A franchise granted under this chapter is for the territorial limits of the
City as they may exist now and in the future.



1.    Grantee shall offer service to all residents and public buildings
within the franchise territory without regard to the race, religion, income,
national origin, disability status, age, or gender of the subscriber, subject
to the following:  Whenever the Grantee receives a request for service from
at least ten (10) single family residences (connections) within one thousand
five hundred (1500) feet of its distribution cable, it shall extend the CATV
system to such subscribers at no cost to the subscribers other than the usual
connection and service fees for all subscribers, provided that such CATV
system extension is technically and physically feasible.  Measurement of the
general density standard for service to any area shall be from the closest
existing point of the Grantee’s CATV system.  No person in the Grantee’s
service area shall be arbitrarily refused service.  However, in unusual
circumstances or service to subscribers of a density of less than ten (10)
single family residences per one thousand five hundred (1500) feet of the
distribution cable, in order that the existing subscribers shall not be
unfairly burdened, service may be made available on the basis of a capital
contribution by the prospective subscriber to the Grantee, including
reimbursement for the Grantee’s cost of materials, labor, and easements.



2.    Grantee shall offer service at equal rates, and on an equal basis
with regards to deposits and service packages, to residential subscribers. 
Grantee may, however, discontinue or refuse service to subscribers and
potential subscribers who have not paid applicable charges.  Further, the
Grantee may offer special services or rates to senior citizens, or services
to commercial subscribers at rates different from those charged residential
subscribers, which shall include, but not be limited to, charges for
installation on a time and material basis.  The Grantee may also enter into
separate contracts with multiple dwelling unit buildings and may charge
discounted rates for services based upon single point billing or other
contractual considerations.  This section does not preclude the Grantee from
offering promotional rates for service introductions or temporary promotional
discounts.



3.    Grantee shall provide a drop and basic service for one outlet, at no
charge, to all current and future public buildings, including, but not
limited to, City Hall, fire stations, public libraries (Cole Library of
Cornell College), and public schools that are presently located in the
existing cable TV service area.  Any new public buildings, schools, city
halls, fire stations, public libraries (including Cornell College) must be
located within 500 feet of the CATV system to receive basic service for one
outlet at no charge.



113.04       POLICE POWER.



Nothing in this chapter or in any franchise agreement hereunder shall be
construed as an abrogation by the City of any of its police powers.



113.05       GRANT OF FRANCHISE.



1.    Application.  All applicants for a franchise under this chapter
shall prepare and file a written application with the Grantor in such form as
the Grantor shall designate.



2.    Review of Application.  Upon receipt of an application under this
chapter, the Grantor shall review the same and make the application available
for public inspection at such places as the Grantor shall designate.  A
decision shall be made on the application by the Grantor after evaluation
thereof.  The Grantor may grant one (1) or more franchises, or may decline
to grant any franchise.



3.    Franchise Required.  Subject to Federal and State law, no cable
system shall be allowed to occupy or use the streets in the franchise area or
be allowed to operate without a franchise granted in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.



4.    Franchise Nonexclusive.  Any franchise granted under this chapter
shall be revocable and nonexclusive.



5.    Franchise Requirements.  Grantor may establish appropriate
requirements for new franchises or franchise renewals, and may modify these
requirements from time to time to reflect changing conditions and technology
in the cable industry.



6.    Grant.  In the event the Grantor shall grant to a Grantee or renew
a nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct, operate, maintain and
reconstruct a cable system within the franchise area, said franchise shall
constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the service of a cable
system as required by this chapter and the terms of the franchise agreement.



7.    Conflicts with Federal or State Laws.  Any franchise granted under
this chapter shall be consistent with Federal laws and regulations and State
general laws and regulations.  In the event of a conflict between the terms
and conditions of the franchise agreement and the terms and conditions of
Federal or State law under which Grantor can grant a franchise, except where
the application of such Federal or State law would impose inconsistent or
additional material obligations or duties upon Grantee, such general law or
requirements shall control.



8.    Ordinance Revisions.  Any franchise granted under this chapter is
hereby made subject to any revisions of this chapter or the general
ordinances of the City, provided that such revisions do not materially alter
or impair the obligations of Grantee set forth in any franchise agreement.



9.    Term.  The term of any new or renewal franchise granted under this
chapter shall be established in the franchise agreement, provided that in no
event shall any franchise granted under this chapter exceed the term of
fifteen (15) years.



10.    Other Licenses or Permits.  A franchise granted under this chapter
shall not take the place of any other license or permit legally required of a
Grantee.



113.06       FRANCHISE ACCEPTANCE.



1.    To accept a franchise granted under this chapter, a Grantee must
file any required bonds, funds and proof of insurance, as well as written
notice of acceptance with the Clerk within 45 days of the effective date of
the franchise agreement.  Such written notice shall include a certification
that the Grantee:



A.    Will comply with this chapter, any franchise agreements made
pursuant to this chapter, and all applicable City, County, State and Federal
regulations in regard to the construction, operation and maintenance of a
cable system;



B.    Accepts the franchise relying on its own investigation and
understanding of the power and authority of the Grantor to grant the
franchise and the terms and conditions thereof;



C.    Acknowledges that it has not been induced to enter into the
franchise by any understanding or promise or by other statement, whether
written or verbal, by or on behalf of the Grantor or by any other third
person concerning any term or condition of the franchise or chapter not
expressed herein;



D.    Shall have no recourse whatsoever against the Grantor for any loss,
cost, expense or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of a
franchise or the enforcement thereof, or for the failure of the Grantor to
have authority to grant any or all parts of the franchise;



E.    Agrees that, in the event of any conflict between the chapter and
the franchise agreement, the terms of the franchise agreement shall prevail.



F.    Will not at any time claim in any proceeding involving the Grantor
that any condition or term of the franchise or chapter is unreasonable,
arbitrary or void, or that the Grantor had no power or authority to make any
such term or condition, but shall accept the validity of the terms and
conditions of the franchise and this chapter in their entirety, except as
provided by local, State, Federal law or FCC rules and regulations.



2.    A Grantee of a franchise granted or transferred under this chapter
may, at the time of acceptance of the franchise, provide an initial payment
to the Grantor in the amount of the Grantor’s cost for printing and
publication cost incurred in granting the franchise.



113.07       TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.



1.    Transfer of Franchise.  Any franchise granted under this chapter
shall be a privilege to be held for the benefit of the public.  Any
franchise so granted cannot, in any event, be sold, transferred, leased,
assigned or disposed of, including, but not limited to, by forced or
voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or other means, without
the prior written consent of the Grantor, and then only under such reasonable
conditions as the Grantor may establish.  Such consent as required by the
Grantor shall be given or denied no later than one hundred twenty (120) days
following any request, and shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Prior
consent shall not be required when transferring the franchise between wholly
owned subsidiaries of the same entity.



2.    Ownership or Control.  The Grantee shall promptly notify in writing
the Grantor of any proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any
other party of, control of the Grantee.  A rebuttable presumption that a
transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or transfer
by any person or group of persons of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
beneficial ownership interest of the Grantee.  Every change, transfer, or
acquisition of control of the Grantee shall make the franchise subject to
cancellation unless and until the Grantor shall have consented in writing
thereto, which consent shall be given or denied no later than one hundred and
twenty (120) days following any request, and shall not be unreasonably
withheld.  For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer or acquisition of control, the Grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the Grantee shall
assist the Grantor in any such inquiry.  In seeking the Grantee’s consent
to any change in ownership or control, the Grantee shall have the
responsibility:



A.    To show to the satisfaction of the Grantor whether the proposed
purchaser, transferee, or assignee (the “proposed transferee”), which in
the case of a corporation shall include all directors and all persons having
a legal or equitable interest in fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting
stock:



(1)   Has ever been convicted or held liable for acts involving moral
turpitude including, but not limited to, any violation of Federal, State or
local law or regulations, or is presently under an indictment, investigation
or complaint charging such acts;



(2)   Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud, deceit or
misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any court of
competent jurisdiction; or



(3)   Has pending any legal claim, lawsuit or administrative proceeding
arising out of or involving a cable system.



B.    To establish, to the satisfaction of the Grantor, the financial
solvency of the proposed transferee by submitting all current financial data
for the proposed transferee which the Grantee was required to submit in its
franchise application, and such other data as the Grantor may request, where
the same shall be audited, certified and qualified by a certified public
accountant.



C.    To establish to the satisfaction of the Grantor that the financial
and technical capability of the proposed transferee is such as shall enable
it to maintain and operate the cable system for the remaining term of the
franchise under the existing franchise terms.



3.    Any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its
assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of
the franchise shall have the right to notify the Grantor that the financial
institution, or its designee, as approved in writing by the Grantor, shall
take control and operate the cable system in the event of a Grantee default
in its financial obligations.  Further, said financial institution shall
also submit a plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and
compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial
institution exercises control over the system.  The financial institution
shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one (1)
year unless extended by the Grantor in its discretion, but during said period
of time it shall have the right to petition the Grantor to transfer the
franchise to another Grantee.  Except insofar as the enforceability of this
subsection may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights
generally, and further subject to applicable Federal, State or local law, if
the Grantor finds that such transfer after considering the legal, financial,
character, technical and other public interest qualities of the proposed
transferee is satisfactory, the Grantor shall transfer and assign the right
and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest.  The consent of
the Grantor to such transfer shall be given or denied no less than one
hundred and twenty (120) days after any request, and shall not be
unreasonably withheld.



4.    The consent or approval of the Grantor to any transfer by the
Grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the Grantor
in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly
subject to the terms and conditions of any franchise.



5.    In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Grantor shall not
approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of
initial construction of the cable system.



6.    In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved
without the successor in interest becoming a signatory of the franchise
agreement.



7.    The Grantor may approve the transfer, deny the transfer with cause,
or conditionally approve the transfer, provided that the Grantor shall not
unreasonably refuse to approve the transfer or condition the transfer upon
unreasonable conditions.  The conditions the Grantor may attach to the
transfer approval may include, but are not limited to: reimbursement for
reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in evaluating the transfer
request; remedy of any existing or historical violations of City ordinances
or the franchise agreement; payment of all fees and penalties owed by the
Grantee at the time of transfer approval; and a guarantee by the prospective
transferee to abide by any and all ordinances, agreements and conditions
placed upon the franchise and system by the Grantor and existing Grantee,
unless mutually removed by the Grantor and Grantee.



8.    When the Grantee approves a transfer under this section, the new
Grantee shall indicate acceptance of the franchise as specified in Section
113.06, including the filing of all necessary bonds, funds, proofs of
insurance and certifications.



113.08       FRANCHISE RENEWAL.



1.    The Grantor may decide to renew a franchise granted under this
chapter if the Grantee files a written request for such a renewal.  At the
time of such request, the Grantor may update this chapter and reevaluate the

the Grantee shall assume all reasonable costs of such an audit.



2.    Acceptance by Grantor.  No acceptance of any payment by the Grantor
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim
the Grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise
fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligations of the
Grantee.



3.    Failure To Make Required Payment.  In the event that any franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified
herein, Grantee shall pay an additional compensation:



A.    An interest charge, computed from such due date, at an annual rate
equal to the average rate of return on invested funds of the Grantor during
the period for which payment was due.



B.    If the payment is late by forty-five (45) days or more, a sum of
money equal to five percent (5%) of the amount due in order to defray those
additional expenses and costs incurred by the Grantor by reason of delinquent

5.    Pass Through.  Any Grantee “pass through” or itemization of
franchise fee costs on subscribers’ bills shall be in accordance with
Federal law.



113.10       REVOCATION.



1.    Grounds For Revocation.  If the Grantee has been given due notice
and a reasonable opportunity to cure, the Grantor reserves the right to
revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges
associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of which
shall represent a default under this chapter and a material breach of the
franchise.



A.    If the Grantee shall default in the performance of any of its
material obligations under this chapter or under such documents, agreements
and other terms and provisions entered into by and between the Grantor and
the Grantee, subject to the provisions on cure.



B.    If the Grantee should fail to provide or maintain in full force and
effect, the liability and indemnification coverages or the security fund or
bonds as required herein.



C.    If any court of competent jurisdiction, or any Federal or State
regulatory body by rules, decisions or other action determines that any
material provision of the franchise documents, including this chapter, the
franchise agreement and Grantee’s proposal is invalid or unenforceable
prior to the commencement of initial system construction.



D.    If the Grantee ceases to provide service for a period exceeding
thirty (30) days for any reason within the control of the Grantee over the
cable system, or abandons the management and/or operation of the system.



E.    If the Grantee willfully violates any of the material provisions of
this chapter or the franchise agreement or attempts to practice any fraud or
deceit upon the Grantor.



F.    If the Grantee becomes insolvent, or upon listing of an order for
relief in favor of the Grantee in a bankruptcy proceeding.



G.    If the Grantee transfers a controlling interest of the franchise
without the prior approval or consent of the Grantor as required in Section
113.07.



2.   Procedure Prior To Revocation.



A.    The Grantor may make a written demand that the Grantee comply with
any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation or
correct any action deemed cause for revocation.  Such written demand shall
detail the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance.  In the event the
stated violation is not reasonably curable within thirty (30) days, the
franchise shall not be terminated or revoked, or damages assessed, if the
Grantee provides within the said thirty (30) days a plan, satisfactory to the
Grantor, to remedy the violation.  If the failure, refusal or neglect of the
Grantee continues for a period exceeding thirty (30) days following receipt
of such written demand by the Grantee, the Grantor may terminate the
franchise agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
113.11.



B.    The Grantor shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall
determine, within ninety (90) days, based upon the preponderance of the
evidence, whether the Grantee has committed a material breach of this chapter
or the franchise agreement, and if so, whether such breach was willful.



C.    If the Grantor determines that the Grantee has willfully committed a
material breach, then the Grantor may, by resolution, declare that the
franchise of such Grantee shall be terminated and security fund and bonds
forfeited, or the Grantor may, at its option and if the material breach is
capable of being cured by the Grantee, direct the Grantee to take appropriate
remedial action within such time and manner and upon such terms and
conditions as the Grantor shall determine are reasonable under the
circumstances.



113.11   PROCEDURES ON TERMINATION.



1.    Disposition of Facilities.  Subject to Federal, State and local

equipment, the Grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that
shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to the Grantee’s removal of its plant,
structures and equipment without affecting the electrical or telephone cable
wires, or attachments.  The Grantee’s insurance, indemnity obligations,
performance bond(s) and security fund(s) required by this chapter and by the
franchise agreement shall continue in full force and effect during the period
of removal and until full compliance by the Grantee with the terms and
conditions of this chapter.

failure by the Grantee to complete any work required by subsection 1 and/or
subsection 2 above, or any other work required by Grantor by law or
ordinance, within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice, and to
the satisfaction of the Grantor, the Grantor may cause such work to be done
and the Grantee shall reimburse the Grantor the cost thereof within thirty
(30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the Grantor may
recover such costs through the security fund or bonds provided by Grantee. 
The Grantor shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce
the provisions of this chapter.



4.    Extended Operation.  Subject to Federal, State and local law, upon
either the expiration or revocation of a franchise, the Grantor may require
the Grantee to continue to operate the cable system for a defined period of
time not to exceed twenty-four (24) months from the date of such expiration
or revocation.  The Grantee shall, as trustee for its successor in interest,
continue to operate the cable communications system under the terms and
conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and to provide the
regular cable service and any of the other services that may be provided at
that time.

involuntary sale of the plant, property and equipment of the Grantee, or any
part thereof, the Grantor may serve notice of termination upon the Grantee
and to the purchaser at such sale, in which event the franchise and rights
and privileges of the Grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty (30)
days after service of such notice, unless:



A.    The Grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as

property and equipment as are necessary and appurtenant to the operation of
the system, provided that all applicable permits are applied for and granted,
all fees paid and all other City codes and ordinances otherwise complied
with.  However, no rights hereunder may be transferred by Grantee to any
other entity except Grantee’s construction agents.



2.    Filing Plans.  Prior to construction or alteration, Grantee shall
in each case file plans with all appropriate City departments and receive
written approval of such plans, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.  Grantee shall provide in writing a monthly progress report to
Grantor through the completion of construction or alteration.



3.    Noninterference.  Grantee shall construct and maintain the system
so as not to interfere with other uses of streets.  Grantee shall make use
of existing poles and other facilities available to Grantee whenever
practicable.  Grantee shall notify all residents directly affected by
proposed construction prior to the commencement of that work.



4.    Denial Of Use By Grantor.  Notwithstanding the above grant to use
the streets, no street shall be used by Grantee if Grantor, in its sole
opinion, determines that such use is inconsistent with the conditions or
provisions by which such street was created or dedicated or presently used.



113.15       CONDITIONS ON USE OF STREETS.



1.    Limit Interference.  All transmission and distribution structures,
lines and equipment erected by Grantee within the City shall be so located as

Chapter 151 of this Code of Ordinances.  Each Grantee shall be responsible
for, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Grantor and its officers,
agents and employees from and against any and all damages arising out of or
resulting from the removal, trimming, mutilation of or injury to any tree or
trees proximately caused by the Grantee or its officers, agents, employees,
contractors or sub-contractors.



113.16       ERECTION OF POLES.

include an authorization, either express or implied, for the Grantee to
construct or install poles or wire-holding structures within streets for the
purpose of placing cables, wires, lines or otherwise without the written
consent of the Grantor.  Such consent shall be given upon such terms and
conditions as the City Engineer may prescribe, which shall include a
requirement that the Grantee perform, at its sole expense, all tree trimmings
required to maintain the poles clear of obstructions.



2.    Access to Poles.  With respect to any poles or wire holding
structures which a Grantee is authorized to construct and install within
streets, a public utility serving the Grantor may, if denied the privilege of
utilizing such poles or wire-holding structures by the Grantee, apply for
such permission to the City Engineer.  If the City Engineer finds that such
use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with
the Grantee’s operations, the City Engineer may authorize such use subject
to such terms and conditions as the City Engineer deems appropriate.  Such
authorization shall include the condition that the public utility pay to the
Grantee any and all actual and necessary costs incurred by the Grantee in
permitting such use.  Nothing herein shall be construed as a right for the
Grantee to utilize public utility property.

1.    Underground Installation Required.  Except as hereinafter provided,
in all areas of the City where the cables, wires and other like facilities of
a public utility are placed underground, each Grantee shall construct and
install its cables, wires and other facilities underground.  Amplifier boxes
and pedestal mounted terminal boxes may be placed aboveground if existing
technology reasonably requires, but shall be of such size and design and
shall be so located as not to be unsightly or unsafe.  In any area of the
City where there are certain cables, wires and other like facilities of a
public utility underground and at least one (1) operable cable, wire or like
facility of a public utility is suspended above the ground from poles, a
Grantee may construct and install its cables, wires and other facilities from
the same pole with permission of the utility company which owns the poles.



2.    Relocation Underground.  With respect to any cables, wires and
other like facilities constructed and installed by a Grantee aboveground, the
Grantee shall, at its sole expense reconstruct and reinstall such cables,
wires, or other facilities underground pursuant to any project under which
the cables, wires or other like facilities of all like utilities are placed
underground within an area.



113.18       RELOCATION.

district or any other similar special district elects to alter, repair,
realign, abandon, improve, vacate, reroute or change the grade of any street
or to replace, repair, install, maintain, or otherwise alter any aboveground
or underground cable, wire, conduit, pipe, line pole, wire-holding structure,
or other facility utilized for the provisions of utility or other services or
transportation or drainage, sewage or other liquids, the Grantee shall,
except as otherwise hereinafter provided, at its sole expense, remove or
relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits,
maintenance holes and any other facilities which it has installed.  If such
removal or relocation is required within the subdivision in which all utility
lines, including those for the system, were installed at the same time, the
entities may decide among themselves who is to bear the cost of relocating,
provided that the Grantor shall not be liable to a Grantee for such costs. 
Regardless of who bears the costs, a Grantee shall take action to remove or
relocate at such time or times as are directed by the agency undertaking the
work.  Reasonable advance written notice shall be mailed to the Grantee
advising the Grantee of the date or dates that the removal or relocation is
to be undertaken.

franchise agreement.  The tests for basic cable service shall be performed
at intervals no greater than twelve (12) months.  The tests may be witnessed
by representatives of the Grantor, and written test reports shall be
submitted to the Grantor.  If more than ten percent (10%) of the locations
tested fail to meet the performance standards, the Grantee shall be required
to indicate what corrective measures have been taken, and the entire test

(4) hour time period, all appointments with subscribers for installation or
service.  Grantee may not cancel an appointment with a customer after the
close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment. 
If a Grantee representative is running late for an appointment with a
customer and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the
customer will be contacted.  The appointment will be rescheduled, as
necessary, at a time which is convenient for the customer.  These standards
shall be met no less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the time, measured on
a quarterly basis.



6.    Repair Standards.  The Grantee shall maintain a repair force of
technicians who, under normal operating conditions, are capable of responding
to subscriber requests for service within the following time frames:



A.    System Service Interruption.  Under normal operating conditions
(including weekends), within two (2) hours of receiving subscribers calls
which by number identify a system service interruption of sound or picture on
one or more channels, affecting all the subscribers of the system or two
percent (2%) thereof.



B.    Isolated Service Interruption.  Within twenty-four (24) hours
(including weekends) of receiving requests for service identifying an
isolated service interruption (less than 2% of subscribers) of sound or
picture for one or more channels.  This standard shall be met no less than
ninety-five percent (95%) of the time, measured on a quarterly basis.



C.    Inferior Reception Quality.  Within forty-eight (48) hours
(including weekends) of receiving a request for service identifying a problem
concerning picture or sound quality.  Grantee shall be deemed to have
responded to a request for service under the provisions of this section when
a technician arrives at the service location and begins work on the
problem.  In the case of a subscriber not being home when the technician
arrives, response shall be deemed to have taken place if the technician
leaves written notification of arrival.



7.    Notification of Service Interruption to City Administrator.  The
Grantee shall promptly notify the City Administrator, in writing, or if
appropriate, by oral communication, of any significant interruption in the
operation of the system.  For the purposes of this section, a “significant
interruption in the operation of the system” means any interruption of
sound or picture on one or more channels of a duration of at least
twenty-four (24) hours to at least five percent (5%) of the subscribers.



8.    Subscriber Credit for Service interruption.  Upon service
interruption of subscriber’s cable service, the following shall apply:



A.    Grantee shall provide, at the subscriber’s request, a credit for

24-hour period service is interrupted for four (4) or more hours.



B.    For interruptions of seven (7) days or more in one month, the
Grantee shall provide, at the subscriber’s request, a credit that will be
issued based an the hourly rate the subscriber pays for all monthly service
and the number of hours of the service interruption.



113.25       PROOF OF COMPLIANCE.



1.    Compliance Records.  Upon reasonable notice, Grantee shall
demonstrate compliance with any or all of the standards required by this
chapter.  Grantee shall provide sufficiently detailed information to permit
Grantor to readily verify the extent of compliance.



2.    Breach for Noncompliance.  A repeated and verifiable pattern of
noncompliance with the consumer protection standards of Section 113.24, after
Grantee’s receipt of due notice and an opportunity to cure, may be termed a
breach of franchise, subject to any and all remedies prescribed in this
chapter, the Act and applicable law.  The Grantee shall not be required to
acquire equipment or perform surveys to measure compliance with the telephone
answering standards in Section 113.24(2) unless an historical record of
complaints indicates a clear failure to comply.



113.26       COMPLAINT PROCEDURES.



1.    Complaints to Grantee.  Grantee shall establish written procedures
for receiving, acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints without
intervention by the Grantor.  The procedures shall prescribe the manner in
which a subscriber may submit a complaint, either orally or in writing.  At
the conclusion of Grantee’s investigation of a subscriber complaint, but in
no event more than ten (10) days after receiving the complaint, Grantee shall
notify the subscriber of the results of the investigation and its proposed
action or resolution, if any.  The Grantee shall also notify the subscriber
of the subscriber’s right to file a complaint with the Grantor in the event
the subscriber is dissatisfied with the Grantee’s decision.



2.    Complaints to Grantor.  A subscriber who is dissatisfied with
Grantee’s proposed decision shall be entitled to have the complaint
reviewed by the Grantor.  The subscriber shall initiate the review by filing
a complaint, together with the Grantee’s decision, if any, with the
Grantor, and the Grantor shall notify the Grantee of the filing.  The
subscriber shall make such filing and notification within twenty (20) days of
receipt of Grantee’s decision or, if no Grantee decision has been provided,
within thirty (30) days after filing the original complaint with Grantee. 
The Grantor may extend these time limits for reasonable cause.



3.    Review by the Grantor.  The Grantor shall determine, upon a review
of a subscriber complaint and the Grantee’s decision, if any, whether
further action is warranted.  In the event the Grantor does not initiate
further proceedings within fifteen (15) days of the filing of the complaint,
the Grantee’s proposed action or resolution shall be final.  If the
Grantor decides to initiate further investigation, the Grantor shall require
the Grantee and the subscriber to submit, within ten (10) days of notice
thereof, a statement of the facts and arguments in support of their
respective positions.  The Grantor shall issue a written decision within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of the statements or, if a hearing is requested,
within fifteen (15) days of the conclusion of the hearing, setting forth the
basis of the decision.



4.    Remedies for Violations.  The Grantor may, as a part of a
subscriber complaint decision issued under the provisions of this chapter,
impose damages on the Grantee.  Damages may be imposed only if the Grantor
finds that the Grantee has arbitrarily refused or failed without
justification, to comply with the provisions of this chapter.



113.27       SUBSCRIBER NOTICE.



1.    Operating Policies.  As subscribers are connected or reconnected to
the cable system, and at least annually, and at any time upon request, and
when Grantee’s procedures change, under normal operating conditions, the
Grantee shall provide each subscriber with written information concerning
products and services offered, prices and options for programming services
and conditions of subscription to programming and other services,
installation and service maintenance policies, instructions on how to use the
cable services, channel positions of programming carried on the system, the
procedures for billing and making inquiries or complaints (including the
name, address and local telephone number of the employee or employees or
agent to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed) and also
furnish information concerning the Grantor office responsible for
administration of the franchise with the name and telephone number of the
office.  The notice shall also indicate Grantee’s business hours, legal
holidays and procedures for responding to inquiries after normal business
hours.  The Grantee shall provide all subscribers and the Grantor written
notice no less than thirty (30) days prior to any proposed change in these
policies.



2.    Rates, Programming Service and Channel Position.  The Grantee,
under normal operating conditions, shall provide all subscribers and the
Grantor with notice of any change in rates, programming services, or channel
position at least thirty (30) days prior to the change(s) through
announcements on the cable system and in writing.



3.    Billing.  Bills will be clear, concise, understandable and shall
include the Grantee’s toll-free or collect telephone number required by
Section 113.24.  Bills shall be fully itemized, with itemizations,
including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and
equipment charges.  Bills shall also clearly delineate all activity during
the billing period, including optional charges, rebates and credits.  In
case of a billing dispute, the Grantee must respond to a written complaint
from a subscriber within thirty (30) days.  Refund checks will be issued
promptly, no later than either (i) the customer’s next billing cycle
following resolution of the request or thirty (30) days, whichever is
earlier, or (ii) the return of the equipment supplied by the Grantee if
service is terminated.  Credits for service shall be issued no later than
the customer’s next billing cycle following the determination that a credit
is warranted.



4.    Copies to Grantor.  Copies of all notices provided to subscribers
shall be filed concurrently with the Grantor.



113.28       QUALITY OF SERVICE.



The overall quality of service provided by Grantee to subscribers may be
subject to evaluation by Grantor, not less often than once annually.  In
addition, Grantor may evaluate the quality of service at any time, based upon
the number of subscriber complaints received by the Grantee and the Grantor,
and Grantee’s response to those complaints.  Grantor’s evaluation that
service quality is inadequate may lead to direction to Grantee to cure the
inadequacies.  Grantee shall commence corrective action within thirty (30)
days after receipt of written notice.  Failure to do so shall be deemed to
be a breach of the franchise and subject to the remedies prescribed in this
chapter.  Grantor, after due process, may utilize the performance bond
and/or security fund provided for in this chapter to remedy any such
franchise breach.



113.29       TENANT’S RIGHTS.



It is Grantor’s intent that tenants not be discriminated against in the
ability to subscribe to cable service.  Grantee shall be required to provide
service to tenants in individual units of a multiple housing facility with
all services offered to other dwelling units within the franchise area, so
long as the owner of the facility consents in writing, if requested by
Grantee, to the following:



1.    Grantee’s providing the service to units of the facility;



2.    Reasonable conditions and time for installation, maintenance and
inspection of the system on the facility premises;



3.    Reasonable conditions promulgated by Grantee to protect Grantee’s
equipment and to encourage widespread use of the system; and



4.    No discrimination in rental charges, or otherwise, between tenants
who receive cable service and those who do not.



113.30       RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS.



1.    Discrimination Prohibited.  Grantee shall not deny service, deny
access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, PEG access channel
users, or general citizens on the basis of income, race, color, religion,
national origin, age, gender, marital status or physical or mental
disability.  Grantee shall comply at all times with the Act and all other
applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations, and all executive
and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination which are hereby
incorporated and made part of this chapter by reference.



2.    Equal Employment.  Grantee shall strictly adhere to the equal
employment opportunity requirements of Federal, State and local law and
regulations in effect on the date of the franchise grant, and as amended from
time to time.



3.    Personal Information.  The Grantee’s policy with regard to
personally identifiable information shall be consistent with Federal law.



4.    Equal Accessibility.  The entire system of the Grantee shall be
operated in a manner consistent with the principle of fairness and equal
accessibility of its facilities, equipment, channels, studios and other
services to all citizens, businesses, public agencies and other entities
having a legitimate use for the system, and no one shall be arbitrarily
excluded from its use.



5.    Discontinuation of Service.



A.    If a subscriber fails to pay any proper fee or charge for any
service, the Grantee may discontinue said service, provided that the
subscriber has been given no less than (13) days’ prior notice of the
intention to discontinue service.



B.    If the Grantee receives payment of all outstanding fees and charges,
including any late charges, prior to the expiration of the fifteenth (15th)
day after receipt transmittal of said notice from the Grantee, then the
Grantee shall not discontinue said service.  After any service has been
discontinued, upon request of the subscriber accompanied by payment in full
of all fees or charges due the Grantee and the payment of an appropriate
reconnection charge, if any, the Grantee shall promptly reinstate said
service.



C.    Subscribers and users shall retain the right to deactivate their
terminals, but shall continue to be responsible for charges until the Grantee
is notified to terminate service.  The subscriber shall not be charged any
fee for the cancellation or downgrading of cable service.



113.31       CONTINUITY OF SERVICE.



1.    Right to Continuous Service.  It shall be the right of all
subscribers to continue receiving service insofar as their financial and
other obligations to the Grantee are honored.  In the event that the Grantee
elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or the Grantor
gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew the franchise, the
Grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous,
uninterrupted service.  In the event of a change of Grantee, or in the event
a new operator acquires the system, the original Grantee shall cooperate with
the Grantor, new Grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to
all subscribers.  During such period, Grantee shall be entitled to the
revenue for any period during which it operates the system, and shall be
entitled to reasonable costs for its services when it no longer operates the
system.



2.    Right of Grantor to Operate System.  In the event Grantee fails to
operate the system for seven (7) consecutive days without prior approval of
the Grantor or without just cause, the Grantor may, working in conjunction
with any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets
for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the
franchise, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as
Grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the Grantor or a
permanent operator is selected.  If the Grantor is required to fulfill this
obligation for the Grantee, then during such period as the Grantor fulfills
such obligation, the Grantor shall be entitled to collect all revenues from
the system, and the Grantee shall reimburse the Grantor for all reasonable
costs or damages in excess of the revenues collected by the Grantor that are
the result of the Grantee’s failure to perform.



113.32       IDENTIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES.



Every employee of the Grantee or its agents shall be clearly identified. 
All employees of Grantee shall display proper identification upon request of
a subscriber.  Every vehicle of the Grantee shall be similarly identified. 
The Grantee’s telephone number shall also be clearly marked on all such
vehicles.



113.33       RECORDS.



1.    Open Books and Records.  The Grantee shall manage all of its
operations in accordance with a policy of totally open books and records. 
The Grantor, upon reasonable notice, shall have the right to inspect at any
time during normal business hours, all books, records, maps, plans, service
complaint logs, performance test results and other like materials of the
Grantee which relate to the regulation of the franchise and are maintained at
the local office required by Section 113.24, provided that the Grantor shall
maintain the confidentiality of any trade secrets or other proprietary
information in the possession of the Grantee, and provided further, that
records shall be exempt from inspection pursuant to this section to the
extent required by applicable law regarding subscriber privacy and to the
extent such records are protected by law against discovery in civil
litigation.  If any such books or records are not kept by the local office,
or upon reasonable request made available to the Grantor, and if the Grantor
shall determine that an examination of such records is necessary or
appropriate to the performance of any of Grantor’s duties, then Grantee
shall make such records available locally.



2.    Required Records.  In any event the Grantee shall at all times
maintain:



A.    The complaint file required by Sections 113.24 and 113.42 herein,



B.    A full and complete set of plans, records, and “as-built” maps
showing the exact location of all cable system equipment installed or in use
in the franchise area, exclusive of subscriber service drops.



113.34       REGULATORY AUTHORITY.



The Grantor shall exercise regulatory authority under the provisions of this
chapter, the Act, and applicable law.  If the franchise area served by the
cable system also serves other contiguous or neighboring communities, Grantor
may, at its sole option, participate in a joint regulatory agency, with
delegated responsibility in the area of cable and related communications.



113.35       REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY.



The Grantor, acting alone or acting jointly with other Grantors, may exercise
or delegate the following regulatory responsibility:



1.    Administering and enforcing the provisions of the cable
communications system franchise(s),



2.    Coordinating the operation of public, educational and government
(PEG) access channel and facilities,



3.    Providing technical, programming and operational support to public
agency users, such as government departments, schools and health care
institutions,



4.    Establishing jointly with the Grantee, or as otherwise specified in
the franchise agreement, procedures and standards for use of channels
dedicated to public use and sharing of public facilities, if provided for in
any franchise agreement,



5.    Planning expansion and growth of public benefit cable services,



6.    Analyzing the possibility of integrating cable communications with
other local, State or national telecommunications networks,



7.    Formulating and recommending long-range telecommunications policy.



113.36       PUBLIC USAGE OF THE SYSTEM.



If so specified in the franchise agreement, the Grantor may utilize a portion
of the cable communication system capacity and associated facilities and
resources to develop and provide noncommercial cable services that will be in
the public interest.  In furtherance of this purpose, the Grantor may
establish a commission, public corporation, or other entity to receive and
allocate PEG and institutional network facilities, support funds and other
considerations provided by the Grantor, the Grantee, and/or others.  Such an
entity, if established, may be delegated the following responsibilities:



1.    Receive and utilize or reallocate for utilization, channel capacity,
facilities, funding and other support provided specifically for PEG and
institutional network usage of the cable communications system.



2.    Establish, jointly with the Grantee, operational procedures and
guidelines for PEG and institutional network usage.



3.    Review the status and progress of each service developed for public
benefit.



4.    Reallocate resources jointly with the Grantee on a periodic basis to
conform with changing priorities and public needs.



5.    Report to the Grantor and the Grantee annually on the utilization of
resources, the new public services developed and the benefits achieved for
the Grantor and its residents.



113.37       RATES.



The Grantee shall establish rates for its services which shall be applied on
a nondiscriminatory basis in the service area, except for commercial and bulk
account rates, which are negotiated individually.  Pursuant to Federal law,
the Grantor reserves the right to assume regulation of rates paid by cable
subscribers; such rate regulation shall be performed by the Mount Vernon
Cable Commission as advisory to the Council in accordance with FCC Rules and
Regulations “Part 76; Subpart N.”  As specified by the FCC’s Rules
(Part 76, Subpart N), such rate regulation shall cover basic service rates
and customer premises installations and equipment rates (including charges
for, but not be limited to:  converter boxes, remote control units,
connections for additional television receivers and other cable home
wiring).  Grantor reserves the right to further regulate rates pursuant to
any additional powers granted it by either the FCC or Federal or State law.



1.    Rate Regulatory Procedures.  In the event that rate regulatory
powers are assumed by Grantor, the following shall apply:



A.    The Grantor shall notify the Grantee of Grantor’s FCC
certification and of Grantor’s adoption of rate regulations which are
consistent with the FCC regulations and which provide for a reasonable
opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.



B.    Upon receipt of such notification by Grantee, basic service
regulation shall become effective.  Grantee shall be prohibited from raising
basic service rates without the approval of the Cable Commission, and Grantee
shall, within thirty (30) days, submit for review its basic service,
installation and equipment rates and supporting documentation using either
the FCC’s benchmark calculations or the FCC’s cost-of- service standards.



2.    Proprietary Information.  To aid in the evaluation of the
Grantee’s proposed rates, the Cable Commission may require the production
of proprietary information, and in such cases will apply procedures analogous
to those set forth in FCC regulations (47 C.F.R. Sec, 0.459), and consistent
with Federal and State law.



3.    Refunds.  As specified in the FCC regulations, the Cable Commission
may order the Grantee to refund to subscribers that portion of previously
paid rates which have been found to be unreasonable.  Before ordering the
Grantee to refund previously paid rates to subscribers, the Cable Commission
must give the Grantee notice and opportunity to comment.



4.    Basic Service Rate increases and Equipment Charges.  Subject to FCC
rules, the Grantee shall not file for increases in equipment charges and/or
basic service rates more than once per year.  All subsequent requests by the
Grantee for increases in equipment changes and/or Basic Service rates shall
be subject to the procedures outlined in this section.



5.    Service Disconnection.  A subscriber shall have the right to have
its service disconnected without charge, which shall include the removal of
any equipment owned by the Grantee from the subscriber’s residence.  Such
disconnection shall be made as soon as practicable and in no case later than
thirty (30) days following written notice to the Grantee of same.  No
Grantee shall enter into any agreement with a subscriber which imposes any
charge following disconnection of service, except for reconnection and
subsequent monthly or periodic charges, and those charges shall be no greater
than charges for new customers.  This section shall not prevent a Grantee
from refusing service to any person because of the Grantee’s prior accounts
with that person which remain due and owing.



113.38       PERFORMANCE REVIEW.



At Grantor’s sole option, within ninety (90) days of the first anniversary
of the effective date of each franchise, and each year thereafter throughout
the term of the franchise, the Grantor may hold a public hearing at which the
Grantee shall be present and shall participate to review the performance and
quality of service of the cable system.  The report required in this chapter
regarding subscriber complaints, the records of performance tests and the
opinion survey reports shall be utilized as the basis for review.  In
addition, any subscriber may submit comments or complaints during the review
meetings, either orally or in writing, and these shall be considered.



1.    Performance Report.  Within thirty (30) days after the conclusion
of the public hearing, Grantor shall issue a report with respect to the
adequacy of system performance and quality of service.  If inadequacies are
found, Grantor may direct Grantee to correct the inadequacies within a
reasonable period of time.



2.    Breach Upon Failure to Cure.  Failure of Grantee, after due notice,
to correct the inadequacies, shall be considered a breach of the franchise,
and Grantor may, at its sole discretion, exercise any remedy within the scope
of this chapter considered appropriate.



113.39       SYSTEM REVIEW.



To provide for technological, economic, and regulatory changes in the state
of the art of cable communications, to facilitate renewal procedures, to
promote the maximum degree of flexibility in the cable system, and to achieve
a continuing, advanced modern system, the following system and services
review procedures are hereby established:



1.    At Grantor’s sole option, the Grantor may hold a public hearing on
or about the third anniversary date of the franchise agreement at which the

hearing shall include, but shall not be limited to, services provided,
feasibility of providing new services, application of new technologies,
system performance, programming, subscriber complaints, user complaints,
rights of privacy, amendments to the franchise, undergrounding processes,
developments in the law, and regulatory constraints.



4.    Either the Grantor or the Grantee may select additional topics for
discussion at any review hearing.



113.40       ANNUAL REPORTS.



Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of Grantee’s fiscal
year, the Grantee may be required to submit a written annual report, in a

113.41       SYSTEM SURVEY REPORTS.



At the Grantor’s request, Grantee shall submit to the Grantor an annual
system survey report which shall be a survey of the Grantee’s plans and a
report thereon.  Said report shall include, but not be limited to, a
description and “as-built” maps of the portions of the franchise area
that have been cabled and have all services available, an appropriate
engineering test report or evaluation including suitable electronic
measurements conducted in conformity with such requirements.  Said report
shall be in sufficient detail to enable the Grantor to ascertain that the
service requirements and technical standards of the franchise are achieved
and maintained.



113.42       COMPLAINT FILE AND REPORTS.



An accurate and comprehensive file shall be kept by the Grantee of any and
all complaints regarding the cable system.  A procedure shall be established
by the Grantee by the time of installation of the cable system to remedy
complaints quickly and reasonably to the satisfaction of the Grantor. 
Complete records of Grantee’s actions in response to all complaints shall
be kept.

report which identifies satisfaction or dissatisfaction among subscribers
with cable communications services offered by the Grantee, shall be submitted
to the Grantor no later than two (2) months after the end of Grantee’s
fiscal year.  The survey required to make said report shall be in a form
that can be transmitted to subscribers with one (1) or more bills for
service, such as postage-paid, self-addressed post cards.  At the

Grantee to, as well as copies of all decisions, correspondence and actions
by, any Federal, State and local courts, regulatory agencies and other
government bodies relating to its cable television operations within the
franchise area.  Grantee shall submit such documents to the Grantor no later
than thirty (30) days after receipt of a Grantor request.

periodic public financial reports and those of its parent, subsidiary and
affiliated corporation and other entities, as the Grantor requests, shall be
submitted to the Grantor within thirty (30) days after receipt of a request.

other information or reports in such forms and at such times as the Grantor
may reasonably request or require.



4.    Inspection of Facilities.  The Grantee shall allow the Grantor to
make inspections of any of the Grantee’s facilities and equipment at any
time upon at least ten (10) days’ notice, or in case of emergency, upon
demand without prior notice, to allow Grantor to verify the accuracy of any
submitted report.



5.    Public Inspection.  All reports subject to public disclosure shall
be available for public inspection at a designated Grantor office during
normal business hours.



6.    Failure to Report.  The willful refusal, failure or neglect of the
Grantee to file any of the reports reasonably required, or such other reports
as the Grantor reasonably may request, may be deemed a breach of the
franchise, and may subject the Grantee to all remedies, legal or equitable,
which are available to the Grantor under the franchise or otherwise.



7.    False Statements.  Any materially false or misleading statement or
representation made knowingly and willfully by the Grantee in any report

to the Grantor under the franchise or otherwise.



8.    Cost of Reports.  One (1) copy of all reports and records required

113.44       REMEDIES FOR FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS.



If the Grantee fails to perform any material obligation under the franchise,
or fails to do so in a timely manner, the Grantor may at its option, and in
its sole discretion:



1.    Assess against the Grantee monetary damages up to the limits
established in the franchise agreement for material franchise violations,
said assessment to be collected by Grantor after completion of the procedures
specified in Section 113.45.  The amount of such assessment shall be deemed
to represent liquidated damages actually sustained by Grantor by reason of
Grantee’s failure to perform.  Such assessment shall not constitute a
waiver by the Grantor of any other right or remedy it may have under the
franchise or under applicable law, including without limitation, its right to
recover from Grantee such additional damages, losses, costs and expenses,
including actual attorney fees, as may have been suffered or incurred by
Grantor by reason of or arising out of such breach of the franchise.  This
provision for assessment of damages is intended by the parties to be separate
and apart from Grantor’s right to enforce the provisions of the
construction and performance bonds provided for in this chapter and is
intended to provide compensation to Grantor for actual damages.



2.    Terminate the franchise, for any of the causes stated in this
chapter.



3.    No remedy shall be imposed by Grantor against Grantee for any
violation of the franchise without Grantee’s being afforded due process of
law, as provided for in Section 113.45.



4.    If the Grantee fails to perform any material obligations under the
franchise, Grantor may access monetary damages against the Grantee.  Grantee
shall be provided due process of law as provided in Section 113.45 of this
chapter and applicable local, State, Federal laws and FCC rules and
regulations prior to any actual assessments of monetary damages.  Monetary
damages may be assessed as follows:



A.    Failure to furnish, maintain, or offer cable services to any
potential subscriber within the existing cable TV system service area upon
order of the Grantor:  two hundred dollars ($200.00) for any such occurrence;



B.    Failure to obtain or file evidence of required insurance or other
required financial security:  three hundred dollars ($300.00) for any such
occurrence;



C.    Failure to provide access to data, documents, records, or reports to
the Grantor as required by this chapter:  one  hundred dollars ($100.00)
for any such occurrence;



D.    Failure to comply with applicable construction, operation, or
maintenance standards:  three hundred dollars ($300.00) for any such
occurrence;



E.    Failure to comply with a rate decision or refund order under the FCC
rules and regulations:  five hundred dollars ($500.00) for any such
occurrence.



   Grantor may impose any or all of the above enumerated measures against
Grantee, which shall be in addition to any and all other legal or equitable
remedies it has under the franchise or under any applicable law.



113.45       PROCEDURE FOR REMEDYING FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS.



In the event that the Grantor determines that the Grantee has violated any
material provision of the franchise, the Grantor may make a written demand on
the Grantee stating the exact nature of the alleged violation, and requesting
that Grantee remedy such violation.  If the violation is not remedied, or in
the process of being remedied, to the satisfaction of the Grantor within
thirty (30) days following such demand, the Grantor shall determine whether
or not such violation by the Grantee was excusable, in accordance with the
following procedures.



1.    An administrative hearing shall be held to review the alleged
violation.  If this hearing does not result in a satisfactory resolution,
and/or the Grantee requests a public hearing, then a public hearing shall be
held, and the Grantee shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard upon
thirty (30) days’ written notice to the Grantee of the time and the place
of the hearing provided and the allegations of franchise violations.



2.    If, after notice is given and, at the Grantee’s option, a full
public proceeding is held, the Grantor determines that such violation by the
Grantee was excusable as provided in Section 113.46, the Grantor shall direct
the Grantee to correct or remedy the same within such additional time, in
such manner and on such terms and conditions as the Grantor may reasonably
direct.



3.    If, after notice is given and, at the Grantee’s option, a full
public proceeding is held, the Grantor determines that such violation was
inexcusable, then the Grantor may impose a remedy in accordance with Section
113.44.



113.46       EXCUSE OF NONPERFORMANCE.



In the event Grantee’s performance of any of the terms, conditions,
obligations, or requirements of the franchise is prevented or impaired due to
any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such
inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or
sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided Grantee has notified
Grantor within a reasonable time after Grantee’s discovery of the
occurrence of such an event.  Such causes beyond Grantee’s reasonable
control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not be limited
to, acts of nature and civil emergencies.



113.47       CONSTRUCTION BOND.



1.    Requirement of Bond.  Within thirty (30) days after the granting of
a new franchise, or a renewal which requires significant system construction,
and prior to the commencement of any construction work by the Grantee, the
Grantee shall file with the Grantor a construction bond in the amount
specified in the franchise agreement in favor of the Grantor and any other
person who may claim damages as a result of the breach of any duty by the
Grantee assured by said bond.



2.    Form of Bond.  Such bond as contemplated herein shall be in the
form approved by the Grantor and shall, among other matters, cover the cost
of removal of any properties installed by the Grantee in the event said
Grantee shall default in the performance of its franchise obligations.



3.    No Limitation on Liability.  In no event shall the amount of said
bond be construed to limit the liability of the Grantee for damages.



4.    Waiver of Bond.  Grantor, at its sole option, may waive this
requirement, or permit consolidation of the construction bond with the
performance bond specified, respectively in Sections 113.47 and 113.48.



5.    Release of Bond.  Upon completion of construction, any construction
bonds then in force shall be released.



113.48       PERFORMANCE BOND.



1.    Requirement of Bond.  Grantor may require Grantee, at least thirty
(30) days prior to the commencement of operation, to file with the Grantor a
performance bond in the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in favor
of the Grantor, who may be entitled to damages as a result of any occurrence
in the operation of or termination of the cable system operated under this
chapter and the franchise agreement.



2.    Form of Bond.  Such bond as contemplated herein shall be in the
form approved by the Grantor.



3.    No Limitation of Liability.  In no event shall the amount of said
bond be construed to limit the liability of the Grantee for damages.



113.49       WORK PERFORMED BY OTHERS.



1.    The Grantee shall give prior notice to the Grantor specifying the
names and addresses of any entity, other than the Grantee, that performs
construction services in excess of $10,000 pursuant to the franchise,
provided, however, that all provisions of the franchise remain the
responsibility of the Grantee.



2.    All provisions of a franchise shall apply to any subcontractor or
others performing any work or services pursuant to the provisions of the
franchise.



3.    Nothing in this section shall be construed as allowing the transfer
of any rights or responsibilities of the Grantee without approval of the
Grantor in writing.



113.50       GRANTEE INSURANCE.



1.   Insurance  Required.  The Grantee shall maintain throughout the
term of the franchise, insurance in amounts at least as follows:



A.    Worker’s Compensation.  Worker’s Compensation with Coverage A
at statutory limits and Coverage B at limits of $500,000/$500,000/$500,000. 
Insurance shall cover the employees of the Grantee in compliance with the
State of Iowa and all other states having the jurisdiction over each employee.

Underground Hazards; and Pollution Control Liability shall include limits of
not less than $1,000,000 for bodily injury (including death) and property

C.    Umbrella Liability.  Umbrella Liability with limits of not less
than $5,000,000 and shall carry the following endorsement:  “It is hereby
understood and agreed that despite anything to the contrary where underlying
insurance, as described herein, provides greater protection or indemnity to
the insured than the terms and conditions of this policy, this insurance
shall pay on behalf of the insured the same terms, conditions and coverages
which apply to the basic underlying insurance.  Where no such broader
underlying insurance exists, this policy shall pay on behalf of the insured
upon terms and conditions and limitations of the carrier’s umbrella excess
policy.”



2.   Certificates to Grantor.  The Grantee shall furnish the Grantor with
copies of such insurance policies or certificates of insurance within
forty-five (45) days of the effective date of the franchise agreement. 
Certificates of insurance shall be furnished by the Grantee to the Grantor
annually thereafter.



3.   Grantor as Additional Insured.  Such insurance policies provided for
herein shall name the Grantor as additional insured, and shall be primary to
any insurance carried by Grantor, and shall contain the following
endorsement:  “Should any of the above described policies be canceled
before the expiration date thereof, the issuing company will endeavor to mail
thirty (30) days’ written notice to the certificate holder named to the
left, but failure to mail such notice shall impose no obligation or liability
of any kind upon the company, its agents or representatives.”



4.   No Limitation on Liability.  The minimum amounts set forth in the
franchise agreement for such insurance shall not be construed to limit the
liability of the Grantee to the Grantor under the franchise issued hereunder
to the amount of such insurance.



5.   Approved Insurers.  All insurance carriers providing coverage under
subsection 1 shall be duly licensed to operate in the State of Iowa.



113.51       INDEMNITY.



1.    Extent of Indemnity.  The Grantee shall, by acceptance of any
franchise granted, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Grantor, its
officers, boards, commissions, agents, and employees from any and all claims,
suits, judgments, for damages or other relief, costs and attorneys, fees in
any way existing out of or through or alleged to arise out of or through:



A.    The act of the Grantor in granting the franchise,



B.    The acts or omissions of Grantee, its servants, employees, or agents
including, but not limited to, any failure or refusal by Grantee, its
servants, employees or agents to comply with any obligation or duty imposed
on Grantee by this chapter or the franchise agreement.



C.    The exercise of any right or privilege granted or permitted by this

Grantor or any other indemnified party shall tender the defense thereof to
the Grantee.  Provided, however, the Grantor or other indemnified party in
its sole discretion may participate in the defense of such claims at
Grantee’s sole expense, and in such event, such participation shall not
relieve the Grantee from its duty or defense against liability or of paying
any judgment entered against such party.  Grantee shall not agree to any
settlement of claims without Grantor approval.



3.    Grantor’s Negligence.  The Grantee shall not be required to
indemnify the Grantor for negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
Grantor’s officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees.



113.52       ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.



No provision of this chapter shall be deemed to bar the right of the Grantor
to seek or obtain judicial relief from a violation of any provision of the
franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement or directive promulgated
thereunder.  Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this
chapter nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit
the right of the Grantor to recover monetary damages, (including all dispute
related expenses such as attorneys’ fees and except where liquidated
damages are otherwise prescribed) for such violation by the Grantee, or
judicial enforcement of the Grantee’s obligations by means of specific
performance, injunctive relief or mandate, or any other judicial remedy
available at law or in equity.  All judicial action sought for a violation
of any provision of the franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement or
directive promulgated thereunder shall be commenced in the Linn County
Circuit Court.



113.53       NON-ENFORCEMENT.



Subject to the provisions of the Act, a Grantee shall not be relieved of any
obligation to comply with any of the provisions of the franchise or any rule,
regulation, requirement or directive promulgated thereunder by reason of any
failure of the Grantor or its officers, agents or employees to enforce prompt
compliance nor shall such be considered a waiver thereof.



113.54       COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.



Notwithstanding any other provisions of the franchise to the contrary, the
Grantee shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the State
and Federal government or any administrative agencies thereof.  Provided,
however, if any such State or Federal law or regulation shall require the
Grantee to perform any service, or shall permit the Grantee to perform any
service, or shall prohibit the Grantee from performing any service, in
conflict with the terms of the franchise or any law or regulation of the
Grantor, then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the Grantee
shall notify the Grantor of the point of conflict believed to exist between
such regulation or law and the laws or regulations of the Grantor or the
franchise.



113.55       UNAUTHORIZED RECEPTION, USE OR SALE OF SERVICES.



1.    It is unlawful for any person to lawfully obtain any cable signal or
service from a Grantee and to resell such cable signal or service without the
prior written consent of such Grantee.



2.    It is unlawful for any person to intercept, de-scramble, decode, or
receive or assist in the interception, de-scrambling, decoding or receiving
of any cable signal or service of a Grantee without the prior written consent
of Grantee.  As used in this subsection “assist in interception,
de-scrambling, decoding or receiving” includes the manufacture or
distribution of equipment intended by the manufacturer or distributor for
unauthorized reception of cable signal or service.



3.    It is unlawful for any person to intentionally damage any cables,
lines or equipment of any Grantee used in or for the purpose of transmitting
cable signals or service.



4.    It is unlawful for any person to obtain cable signals or service
from any Grantee of the Grantor by means of fraud, deceit or theft.



113.56       WAIVER OR EXEMPTION.



The Grantor reserves the right to waive provisions of this chapter, or exempt
a Grantee from meeting provisions of this chapter, if the Grantor determines
such waiver or exemption is in the public interest.

149.01   PURPOSE.



It is the purpose of this chapter to protect the health, safety and general
welfare of the people of the City of Mount Vernon by ensuring that the ground
waters will not be polluted or contaminated.  Minimum requirements are
contained in this chapter for the construction, reconstruction, repair, and
destruction of geothermal wells.



149.02   DEFINITIONS.



For use in this chapter, the following terms are defined:



1.   "Annular Space" - The space between the casing or well screen and the
wall of the borehole, or between drilling pipe and casing, or between two
separate strings of casing.



2.   "Aquifer" - A subsurface water-bearing layer of soil, sand, gravel,
or rock that will yield usable quantities of water to a well.



3.   "Borehole" - A hole drilled or bored into the earth, usually for
exploratory or economic purposes; a hole into which casing, screen, and other
materials may be installed to construct a well. 



4.   "Casing" - An impervious, durable pipe placed in a borehole to
prevent the walls of the borehole from caving, and to seal off surface
drainage or undesirable water, gas or other fluids and prevent entrance into
a well.



5.   "Drinking Water" - Water which is intended for human consumption and
other domestic uses, and is considered to be free of harmful chemicals and
disease-causing microorganisms.



6.   "Geothermal Borehole" - A hole drilled or bored into the earth into
which piping is inserted for use in a geothermal system.



7.   "Geothermal System" - A geothermal system uses the earth's thermal
properties in conjunction with electricity to provide greater efficiency in
the heating and cooling of buildings. 



8.   "Geothermal System (Closed Horizontal Loop)" - A mechanism for heat
exchange which consists of the following basic elements:  underground loops
of piping; heat transfer fluid; a heat pump; an air distribution system.  An
opening is made in the earth.  A series of pipes are installed into the
opening and connected to a heat exchange system in the building.  The pipes
form a "closed loop" and are filled with a heat transfer fluid.  The fluid
is circulated through the piping from the opening into the heat exchanger and
back.  The system functions in the same manner as the open loop system
except there is no pumping of ground water.  A horizontal closed loop system
shall be no more than twenty (20) feet deep. 



9.   "Geothermal System (Closed Vertical Loop)" - A borehole extends
beneath the surface.  Pipes are installed with U-bends at the bottom of the
borehole.  The pipes are connected to the heat exchanger and heat transfer
fluid is circulated through the pipes. 



10.   "Geothermal System (Open Loop)" - Ground water is pumped from a
water well into a heat exchanger located in a surface building.  The water
drawn from the earth is then pumped back into the aquifer through a different
well or in some cases the same well.  Alternatively, the ground water could
be discharged to a surface water body.  In the heating mode, cooler water is
returned to the earth, while in the cooling mode warmer water is returned to
the surface water body. 



11.   "Ground Water" - Water beneath the earth's surface, that occurs
between saturated soil and rock that supplies wells and springs.



12.   "Grout" - A low permeability material that is emplaced in the space
between the wall of the borehole and the casing of a well and/or emplaced on
the wall of the borehole.  The emplacement of grout is to  prevent the
migration of water or fluid contaminants into and through the borehole. 
Grout shall consist of neat cement, high solids bentonite slurry, or hydrated
bentonite chips. 



13.   "Heat Exchanger" - A device, usually made of coils of pipe, that
transfers heat from one medium to another; for example, from water to air or
water to water.



14.   "Heat Transfer Fluid" - Any liquid used specifically for the purpose
of transferring thermal energy from the heat source to another location.



15.   "Low Permeability Material" - A geological unit of unconsolidated
material (usually clay or till) or bedrock (usually shale) that is all or
partially saturated, and having permeability low enough (10-7 cm/sec) to give
water in the aquifer artesian head. 



16.   "Permeability" - The propensity of a material to allow fluid to move
through its pores or interstices.  Permeability is an important soil
parameter when flow of water through soil or rock is a matter of concern.



17.   "Separation/Isolation Distances" - The distance of a source of
contamination from a surface drinking water source, a ground water source
supply well, or any type of borehole.



18.   "Surface Water" - Water located on the surface of the earth in 
water bodies such as lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, and reservoirs.



19.   "Tremie" - A tubing string (typically about 2 to 3 inches in
diameter) that is temporarily installed into the borehole during well
construction.  The tremie pipe is used for installing annular material such
as filter pack sand and grout.



20.   "Water Supply Well" - A well used by public water systems, or
non-public use, for extracting ground water for human consumption.



21.   "Well" - Any excavation that is drilled, cored, driven, dug, bored,
augured, jetted, washed or is otherwise constructed for the purpose of
exploring for ground water, monitoring ground water, utilizing the geothermal
properties of the ground, or extracting water from or injecting water into
the aquifer.  "Well" does not include an open ditch, drain tiles, an
excavation made for obtaining or prospecting for oil, natural gas, minerals,
or products mined or quarried, lateral geothermal heat exchange systems less
than twenty (20) feet deep, nor temporary dewatering wells such as those used
during the construction of subsurface facilities only for the duration of the
construction. 



149.03   PERMIT REQUIRED.



No person shall dig, bore, drill, replace, modify, repair, or destroy a
geothermal well or any other excavation that may intersect ground water
without first applying for and receiving a permit from the City.  A permit
is required for all closed loop horizontal and closed loop vertical systems.



149.04   APPLICATION PROCEDURE.



Applications for permits shall be made to the City Engineer on approved forms
and shall contain all such information as required on the form.  The
application shall be applied for by the property owner, his/her
representative, or the well driller and accompanied by the required filing
fee.



149.05   PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.



The City Public Works Department may suspend or revoke any permit issued
pursuant to this chapter whenever it finds that the permitee has violated any
of the provisions of this chapter or has misrepresented any material fact in
his/her/its application or, any supporting documents for such permit.



149.06   WELL PERMITS.



All proposed well drillers must obtain a permit from the Linn County Health
Department and conform to Chapter 49 of the Iowa Administrative Code Section
567-49.29(455B).  A site plan showing the generally proposed location,
number of wells and proposed depth of the wells must be submitted to the City
Engineer and Water Superintendent for approval.  The plan must include the
calculated anticipated volume of grout that will be required.



149.07   PERMIT FEE.



A permit fee of $500.00 must be submitted with the application along with an
additional $20.00 for each well except that a permit fee of $25.00 will be
charged for a closed horizontal loop geothermal well system.



149.08   OPEN LOOP SYSTEMS PROHIBITED.



Due to the serious potential adverse environmental impact with open loop
systems, open loop systems are prohibited.



149.09   HORIZONTAL CLOSED LOOP SYSTEMS PERMITTED.



Subject to obtaining a permit, closed loop systems less than twenty (20) feet
deep are permitted subject to all zoning regulations including setbacks.



149.10   VERTICAL CLOSED LOOP SYSTEMS.



Vertical closed loop systems will only be allowed when it is shown that a
horizontal loop system is not feasible due to lack of land area or to unique
surface or subsurface geological conditions or unique topographical
conditions as determined by the City Engineer.



149.11   GROUND WATER PROTECTION FOR VERTICAL CLOSED LOOP SYSTEMS.



1.   Vertical geothermal wells should be constructed with materials of
such quality to ensure the integrity of the well during and after the
construction process. 



2.   The construction of a closed loop vertical system should follow the
existing requirements of the City well drilling code.  Where any conflicts
between the well drilling code and this chapter exist with respect to
geothermal wells, the requirements of this chapter shall prevail. 



3.   If a water supply well is drilled into bedrock, the casing must
extend at least ten (10) feet into the bedrock. 



4.   Casings are not necessary for geothermal boreholes provided the
borehole is filled with grout in a timely manner and the minimum separation
distance from potential sources of pollution are met.



5.   Casings should be used during the installation of the borehole to
protect the borehole from collapsing. 



6.   Casings can be removed as the borehole is filled with grout.



7.   All boreholes shall be filled with grout within seven (7) days of
installation. 



8.   After the borehole is installed the casing should be capped until the
grouting process begins. 



9.   If a borehole is drilled so that it connects different aquifers, the
construction must be such that the aquifers remain isolated from one
another.  The boreholes that become a connective apparatus to potential
areas of pollution are prohibited.



10.   All boreholes must be terminated at least four (4) feet below the
surface.  Boreholes terminated in a structure should be terminated flush
with the finished floor.



11.   All vertical loops of the system must be encased in grout to protect
the pipes from damage as well as providing a heat transfer medium. 



12.   Prior to completion of the geothermal loop, all pipes must be
pressure tested to ensure no leaks are present.  Any system found to leak
must be replaced.  Piping used must be 160 psi pressure rated high density
polyethylene or polybrutylene.  Piping must be pressure tested with air or
potable water for fifteen (15) minutes at a pressure of 1.5 times the system
operating pressure after installation in the borehole. 



13.   All grout must have a maximum coefficient of permeability of 10-7
cm/s.  Grout must form a good hydraulic seal with the pipes used for the
geothermal loop so that water cannot flow along the pipe.



14.   The grout must be installed by filling the borehole from the bottom
up using a minimum 1¼" tremie.  The entire borehole must be filled with
grout. 



15.   Only grouts specifically formulated for geothermal applications
shall be used.  Grout shall not add chemicals to the aquifer. 



16.   Boreholes must be protected from surface water intrusion and
cross-aquifer mixing during construction.  Boreholes must be grouted as soon
as reasonably possible after the geoexchange piping system has been installed
and pressure tested.  Boreholes should not be left open for  significant
lengths of time after they are drilled.  Steel casings shall be capped when
not in use. 



17.   Connection to piping must use socket fusion or butt fusion joining
methods. 



18.   Only food grade or U.S. PEA grade propylene glycol or calcium
chloride may be used as heat transfer fluid.  Any other materials or
additives must be NSF approved for drinking water applications.  A permanent
sign must be attached to the heat pump specifying that only approved heat
transfer fluids may be used. 



19.   A flow measurement device must be installed on each system.



20.   Water make-up lines to the vertical heat exchanger must be protected
with a back-flow prevention device. 



149.12   VERTICAL LOOP SYSTEMS WITHIN 1,000 FOOT RADIUS OF A CITY WATER
WELL.



1.   The well drilling contractor will drill one (1) bore to determine the
bedrock elevation.  This boring can be used for one (1) closed circuit
vertical heat exchanger. 



2.   The bottom of the remaining closed circuit vertical heat exchanger
borings may be no lower than 30 feet above the top of the bedrock elevation. 



149.13   CLOSED LOOP VERTICAL SYSTEMS BETWEEN 1,000 AND 2,000 FEET RADIUS
OF A CITY WATER WELL.



In the event that a closed circuit vertical loop system is between 1,000 feet
and 2,000 feet of a City water well, the following will apply:



1.   The bottom of the closed circuit vertical heat exchanger cannot be
any lower in elevation than five (5) feet of elevation of the bottom of the
water well casing. 



2.   The closed circuit vertical heat exchanger may not, under any
circumstances, be bored into bedrock.



149.14   CLOSED LOOP VERTICAL SYSTEMS OUTSIDE OF 2,000 FOOT RADIUS OF A
CITY WATER WELL.



If a closed circuit vertical loop system is outside a 2,000 foot radius of a
City water well, the following will apply:



1.   The bottom of the closed circuit vertical heat exchanger cannot be
any lower in elevation than five (5) vertical feet of elevation of the bottom
of the water well casing. 



2.   The closed circuit vertical heat exchanger may not, under any
circumstances, be bored into bedrock. 



149.15   TESTING OF SYSTEM.



All geothermal systems must be pressure checked every ten (10) years at the
owner's expense.



149.16   ABANDONMENT OF GEOTHERMAL SYSTEMS.



The procedure used for abandonment of geothermal systems must be the same as
currently in the well drilling code.  The heat transfer fluid must be
removed by a displacement with grout.  The top of the borehole must be
uncovered and capped with grout.



149.17   REGULATION CONFLICT.



In the event any of the provisions of this chapter conflict with any State or
Federal regulations, the State or Federal regulations will control.

feet over sidewalks and eighteen (18) feet over all streets.



2.   Public Property.  The maintenance of the parking or terrace of

minimum heights set out above within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
said notice. The notice required herein shall be served by mailing a copy of
the notice to the last known address of the property owner by certified mail.
If the City Administrator or designee is unable to secure notice on the
property owner, said written notice may be served on the occupant or person
in charge of the property in the same manner as set out herein.



4.   Failure to Comply.  When a person to whom such notice is directed
shall fail to comply within the specified time, the City Administrator or

151.07       DISEASE CONTROL.



Any dead, diseased or damaged tree or shrub which may harbor serious insect
or disease pests or disease injurious to other trees is hereby declared to be
a nuisance. The City Administrator or designee  shall inspect or cause to be
inspected any trees or shrubs in the City reported or suspected to be dead,
diseased or damaged, and such trees and shrubs shall be subject to the
following:



1.   City Property.  If it is determined that any such condition exists
on any public property, including the strip between the curb and the lot line
of private property, the City Administrator or designee may cause such
condition to be corrected by treatment or removal. The City Administrator or
designee may also order the removal of any trees on the streets of the City
which interfere with the making of improvements or with travel thereon.



2.   Private Property.  If it is determined with reasonable certainty
that any such condition exists on private property and that danger to other
trees or to adjoining property or passing motorists or pedestrians is
imminent, the Clerk shall notify by certified mail the owner, occupant or
person in charge of such property to correct such condition by treatment or
removal within fourteen (14) days of said notification. If such owner,
occupant or person in charge of said property fails to comply within fourteen
(14) days of receipt of notice, the City Administrator or designee  may
cause the condition to be corrected and the cost assessed against the
property. 



151.08       INTERFERENCE WITH CLERK.



No person shall hinder, prevent, delay or interfere with the City
Administrator or designee or any of the City Administrator or designee's
assistants while they are engaged in carrying out the execution or
enforcement of this chapter; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be
construed as an attempt to prohibit the pursuit of any remedy, legal or
equitable, in any court of competent jurisdiction for the protection of
property rights by the owner of any property within the City.



151.09       ARBORICULTURAL SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS OF PRACTICE.



The following Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice are
hereby adopted by the City:



1.   Planting.  All trees planted on the streets shall be of sufficient
size to warrant satisfactory results and stand the abuse common to street
trees. Unless otherwise allowed for substantial reasons, all standard sized
trees shall have comparatively straight trunks, well developed leaders, top
and root characteristics of the species or variety showing evidence of proper
nursery pruning. All trees must be free of insects, disease, mechanical
injuries and other objectionable features at the time of planting. To
compensate for any serious loss of roots, the top of the tree should be
reduced by thinning or cutting back as determined by the growth
characteristics of the tree species. The leader shall not be cut off in such
trimming. Trees cannot be planted on the parking if it is less than four feet
in width for columnar trees, five to eight feet for others, or contains less
than twenty-five square feet of exposed soil surface. Trees should not be
planted to obstruct or shade the street lights, vision of traffic signs or
the view of street intersection. If it is at all possible, trees should be
planted inside the property lines and not between the sidewalk and curb. In
all newly platted additions, trees are to be placed inside the property lines
rather than on the parking. Trees may be guyed or supported in an upright
position according to accepted arboricultural practices. The guys or supports
shall be fastened in such a way that they will not girdle or cause serious
injury to the trees or endanger public safety.



2.   Pruning.  Trees can be pruned anytime of the year, except during
initial bud break. Utilize the three step method of pruning to protect the
branch collar and to promote natural sealing. Do not use pruning paints or
sealers. No topping or dehorning of public trees shall be permitted.



3.   Cotton-bearing Trees. Cotton-bearing cottonwood trees and all other
cotton-bearing poplar trees are prohibited.



151.10   DECISION-APPEAL.



Any decision of the City Administrator or designee under this Chapter may be
appealed to the Tree Division within five (5) business days of the decision.

by the Building Code. Requests for consideration of alternate provisions or
their application shall be submitted to the Building Official by the building
owner or the owner's agent in writing and shall contain any data necessary to
show evidence that the alternate is satisfactory and that the material,
method, or work offered is for the purpose intended and at least the
equivalent of that prescribed in the Building Code in quality, strength,

152.04   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT



The administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter are as

issued by the City. The Building Official or his/her designee may at his/her
discretion extend the expiration period of the building permit.



13.   Building permits issued on the basis of plans and applications
approved by the Building Official authorize only the use, arrangement, and
construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other

variance with that authorized shall be deemed in violation of this chapter
and punishable as provided by this section and Section 152.16.

500   ARTICLE FIVE: SPECIAL OVERLAY DISTRICTS



501   GENERAL PURPOSE.



Special Districts provide for base districts that allow multiple land uses
and flexible development, with the requirement that a specific plan for the
area be submitted by applicants. Overlay Districts are used in combination
with base districts to modify or expand base district regulations. Overlay
Districts are adapted to special needs of different parts of the City of
Mount Vernon. The Overlay Districts are designed to achieve the following
objectives:



1.   Overlay Districts are intended to help the city manage development in
areas that exhibit special characteristics or features that warrant a greater
differentiation of standards. These districts may be applied to a parcel in
combination with a Base Zoning District.



2.   To recognize special conditions in specific parts of the City which
require specific regulation.



3.   To provide flexibility in development and to encourage innovative
design through comprehensively planned projects.



502   DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED. 



The following overlay districts are herewith established:

of enactment and referenced to the enacting Ordinance.



508   FP/FW – FLOODPLAIN/FLOODWAY MANAGEMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT.



1.   Statutory Authority, Findings of Fact and Purpose. The Legislature of
the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the
power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and
to promote health and the general welfare.



2.   Findings of Fact.



   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Mount Vernon are subject
to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare of the community.



   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are
caused by: (i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being
inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the
cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in
flood heights and velocities.



3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Ordinance to protect
and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Mount Vernon
and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health,
welfare, and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing flood
losses with provisions designed to:



   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety
or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities.



   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the
time of initial construction or substantial improvement.



   C.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited
for intended purposes because of flood hazard.



   D.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in
the community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood
Insurance Program.



4.   General Provisions. The provisions of this Ordinance shall apply to
all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Mount Vernon which are
located within the boundaries of the Floodplain Overlay District as
established in Article 5.



5.   Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain Overlay District. The
boundaries of the Floodplain Overlay District areas shall be determined by
scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map.  When an
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the Zoning
Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The Board of
Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this Ordinance.



6.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance.



7.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this
Ordinance to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this Ordinance imposes greater
restrictions, the provision of this Ordinance shall prevail.  All other
ordinances inconsistent with this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent
of the inconsistency only.



8.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and
shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be
deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.



9.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
Ordinance are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This Ordinance
does not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain Overlay District
areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.  This Ordinance shall not
create liability on the part of the City of Mount Vernon or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.



10.   Establishment of Floodplain Overlay District. The areas within the
jurisdiction of the City of Mount Vernon having special flood hazards are
hereby designated as a Floodplain Overlay District and shall be subject to
the standards of the Floodplain Overlay District (as well as those for the
underlying zoning district).  The Floodplain Overlay District boundaries
shall be as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) for Linn County and
Incorporated Areas, City of Mount Vernon, Panel 19113C0465D and C0470D, dated
April 5, 2010.



11.   Standards of Floodplain Overlay District. All uses must be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following
applicable performance standards.  Where 100-year flood data has not been
provided on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination. All development within the
Floodplain Overlay District shall:



   A.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.



   B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.



   C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.



   D.   Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, state and
local governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources.



12.   Residential Buildings. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a
minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood level.  Construction shall
be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0 ft.
above the 100-year flood level and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet
beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon.  Alternate methods of
elevating (such as piers) may be allowed subject to favorable consideration
by the Board of Adjustment, where existing topography, street grades, or
other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used
must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding.



All new residential structures shall be provided with a means of access which
will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.



13.   Non-residential Buildings. All new or substantially improved
non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood level, or
together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such
a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered
in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are
adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and
uplift forces and other factors associated with the 100-year flood; and that
the structure, below the 100-year flood level is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North
AmericanVertical Datum, 1988) to which any structures are floodproofed shall
be maintained by the Administrator.



14.   New and Improved Structures. All new and substantially improved
structures:



   A.   Fully enclosed areas below the "lowest floor" (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters.  Designs for meeting this requirement must either
be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:



      (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.



      (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.



      (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves,
or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.



Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage.



   B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.



   C.   New and substantially improved structures must be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.

(1) foot above the 100-year flood level.



   B.   All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing
factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include,
but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.



16.   Utility and Sanitary Systems. On-site waste disposal and water
supply systems shall be located or designed to avoid impairment to the system
or contamination from the system during flooding.



   A.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
system as well as the discharge of effluent into flood waters.  Wastewater
treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a
level of flood protection equal to or greater than one (1) foot above the
100-year flood elevation.



   B.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided
with a level of protection equal to or greater than one (1) foot above the
100-year flood elevation.



   C.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located
and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the
risk associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.



17.   Storage of Materials. Storage of materials and equipment that are
flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood
level.  Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or
(i) not be subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement
due to flood waters or (ii) be readily removable from the area within the
time available after flood warning.



18.   Flood Control. Flood control structural works such as levees, flood
walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from a 100-year flood
with a minimum of 3 ft. of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate
interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.



19.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion.  In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.



20.   Subdivision Regulations. Subdivisions (including factory-built home
parks and subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damages and shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage.  Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the
installation of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance
standards of this Ordinance.  Subdivision proposals intended for residential
use shall provide all lots with a means of access which will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood. Proposals for subdivisions

transactions and correspondence pertaining to the administration of this
Ordinance.



24.   Floodplain Development Permit Required. A Floodplain Development
Permit issued by the Administrator shall be secured prior to any floodplain
development (any approved change to improved and unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, filling,
grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations), including the placement
of factory-built homes.



   A.   Application for Permit - Application shall be made on forms
furnished by the Administrator and shall include the following:



      (a)   Description of the work to be covered by the permit for
which application is to be made.



      (b)   Description of the land on which the proposed work is to

Ordinance.



   B.   Action on Permit Application - The Administrator shall, within
a reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain
development meets the applicable standards of this Ordinance and shall
approve or disapprove the application.  For disapprovals, the applicant
shall be informed, in writing, of the specific reasons therefore. The
Administrator shall not issue permits for variances except as directed by the
City Board of Adjustment.



   C.   Construction and Use to be as Provided in Application and Plans
- Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth
in such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or
construction.  Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance.  The applicant
shall be required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land
surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished
fill, building floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection
measures were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this
Ordinance, prior to the use or occupancy of any structure.



25.   Variance. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this Ordinance that will not
be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance will result in
unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable
standards:



   A.   Variances shall only be granted upon:



      (a)   a showing of good and sufficient cause,



      (b)   a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in unnecessary hardship to the applicant, and



      (c)   a determination that the granting of the variance will
not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes or
ordinances.



   B.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.



   C.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this Ordinance,
the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that:



      (a)   the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage, and



      (b)   such construction increases risks to life and property.



   D.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment
Shall be Based - In passing upon applications for Variances, the Board shall
consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this Ordinance
and:



      (a)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments.



      (b)   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land
or downstream to the injury of others.



      (c)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions.



      (d)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner.



      (e)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the City.



      (f)   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain
location.



      (g)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.



      (h)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.



      (i)   The relationship of the proposed use to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area.



      (j)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood
for ordinary and emergency vehicles.



      (k)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise
and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.



      (l)   The cost of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
(sewer, gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.



      (m)    Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of
this Ordinance.



   E.   Conditions Attached to Variances - Upon consideration of the
factors listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of
this Ordinance. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited
to:



      (a)   Modification of waste disposal and water supply
facilities.



      (b)   Limitation of periods of use and operation.



      (c)   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.



      (d)   Requirements for construction of channel modifications,
dikes, levees. and other protective measures, provided such are approved by
the Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical
alternative to achieving the purpose of this Ordinance.



      (e)   Floodproofing measures.



26.   Nonconforming Uses. A structure or the use of a structure or
premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this Ordinance,
but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:



   A.   If such use is discontinued for six (6) consecutive months, any
future use of the building premises shall conform to this Ordinance.



   B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not
be entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.



   C.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any
means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more
than fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred, unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions
of this Ordinance.  This limitation does not include the cost of any
alteration to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building
or safety codes or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, provided that the
alteration shall not preclude its continued designation.



27.   Penalties for Violations. Violations of the provisions of this
Ordinance or failure to comply with any of the requirements shall constitute
a misdemeanor.  Any person who violates this Ordinance or fails to comply
with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more
than $500.00 (five hundred) or imprisoned for not more than 30 (thirty)
days.  Nothing herein contained prevent the City of Mount Vernon from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.

restored, before the damage occurred.



The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary,
or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe
living conditions.  The term also does not include any alteration of an
"historic structure", provided the alteration will not preclude the

700   ARTICLE SEVEN: SUPPLEMENTAL SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS



701   PURPOSE.



The Supplemental Site Development Regulations recognize the existence of
special conditions that cannot comply literally with the site development
regulations set out for each zoning district. Therefore, these regulations
qualify or modify the district regulations of this Ordinance and provide for
specific areas of exception.



702   SETBACK ADJUSTMENTS



1.   Lots Adjoining Alleys. In calculating the depth of a required side or
rear yard setback for a lot adjoining a dedicated public alley, one-half of
the alley may be credited as a portion of the yard. However, no structure may
be nearer than three feet to the near side of the alley.



2   Encroachments on Required Yards. Every part of a required yard shall
be open and unobstructed from finished grade upward, except as specified
herein.



   A.   Architectural projections, including roofs which cover porches,
enclosed porches, window sills, belt courses, cornices, eaves, flues and
chimneys, and ornamental features may project three feet into a required yard.



   B.   Terraces, patios, uncovered decks, and ornamental features
which have no structural element more than two feet above or below the
adjacent ground level may project ten feet into a required yard. However, all
such projections must be set back at least three feet from an adjacent side
lot line; or twenty feet from any street property line. ADA ramps servicing a
dwelling unit may be projected 11 feet into a required yard.



   C.   Fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways, and balconies
opening to fire towers may project a maximum of 3 feet into required yards,
provided that they do not obstruct the light and ventilation of adjacent
buildings.



   D.   For buildings constructed upon a front property line, a cornice
may project into public right-of-way.  Maximum projection is the smaller of
four feet or five percent of the right-of-way width.



   E.    In commercial districts, a canopy may extend into a required
front yard, provided that the canopy is set back at least five feet from the
front property line, covers less than fifteen percent of the area of the
required front yard, and has a vertical clearance of at least eight feet six
inches.



   F.   Accessory uses and buildings are subject to all site
development regulations of its zoning district, except as provided below:



      (a)   Side Yards:  An accessory building may be located a
minimum of five feet from the side lot line of the property if it is located
between the rear building line of the principal building and the rear
property line.



      (b)   Front Yards: No accessory building may be located
between the front building line of the principal building and the front
property line.



      (c)   Rear Yard: The minimum rear yard setback for accessory
buildings shall be 8 feet. This minimum rear yard setback shall be increased
to 15 feet if the accessory building requires vehicular access from an
alley.  Double-frontage lots shall require front-yard setbacks along both
street frontages as set forth in the bulk regulations table of each zoning
district. Easements may be incorporated into these required setbacks. No
accessory building shall be located within any easement or right-of-way along
the rear property line.



      (d)   Street Yards: No accessory building shall be located
within 20 feet from any street side yard property line.



      (e)   Maximum Size: No accessory building shall exceed 144
square feet, or 1.5% of total lot area, whichever is larger, within an SR,
TR, or HR residential district, providing that the necessary building permit
is obtained.  All buildings on a site, including detached garages for a
single family detached, single family attached, or duplex residential uses,
taken together, must comply with the building coverage requirements for the
zoning district. In addition, the maximum square feet of any detached garage
shall not exceed 100% of the primary dwelling unit ground floor square feet,
excluding any attached garage square feet.



      (f)   Height: In residential districts, the maximum height
shall be 12 feet for a detached garage and 10 feet for any other accessory
building.  Additionally and without any increase to the height of the
sidewalls of a detached garage or accessory building based on the
aforementioned maximum height limitations, the height and pitch of the roof
may be increased if, in the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, that
increase is necessary to complement the pitch and style of the primary
residential structure. However, in no event shall a detached garage or
accessory building exceed the height of 20 feet as measured from the
established grade to the highest point of the structure.



      (g)   Separation from Other Buildings: No accessory building
shall be placed within ten feet of any other building on its own property or
any adjacent properties.



      (h)   Attached Accessory Buildings: Any accessory building
physically attached to the principal building shall be considered part of the
principal building and subject to the development regulations of its zoning
district.



      (i)   Effect on Adjacent Properties: If an adjacent lot is
built upon, the accessory building must be entirely to the rear of the line
of any principal building on such adjacent lot.  No accessory building shall
damage adjacent property by obstructing views, inhibiting solar access, or
hindering ventilation.



      (j)   Hazards:  Any accessory use which creates a potential
fire hazard shall be located a minimum of 10 feet from any residential
structure. Such uses include but are not limited to detached fireplaces,
barbecue ovens, or storage of flammable materials.



      (k)   No accessory building shall be built upon any lot until
construction of the principal building has begun.



   G.   Lamp posts with a maximum height of ten (10) feet, and flag
poles up to maximum height of base district may be located within required
yards, provided they are set back at least five (5) feet from property lines.



   H   Garage Setbacks: Any garage, detached or attached, that fronts
on a public street must be set back at least 20 feet from such street or as
is required by the minimum setback requirements of the zoning district,
whichever is greater.



3.   Setback Adjustments.



   A.   Setbacks on Built-Up Blockfaces. These provisions apply if
forty percent or more of the buildings on that blockface have front yard
setbacks different from those required for the specific district.



      (a)   If a building is to be built on a parcel of land within
100 feet of existing buildings on both sides, the minimum front yard shall be
the mean setbacks of the adjacent buildings.



      (b)   If a building is to be built on a parcel of land within
100 feet of an existing building on one side only, the minimum front yard
shall be the setback of the adjacent building.



      (c)   If a building is to be built on a parcel of land not
within 100 feet of an existing building on either side, then the minimum
front yard shall be the mean setback of all existing buildings on the
blockface.



      (d)   No setback adjustment pursuant to this section shall
create a required front yard setback more than five feet greater than that
otherwise required by the applicable zoning district.



   B.   Corner Lots. Required setbacks shall not reduce the buildable
width of any corner lot to less than 24 feet. Appropriate setback adjustments
shall be allowed to maintain this minimum width.



4.   Rear Yard Exceptions - Residential Uses. When an irregular lot is
used for residential purposes, the rear yard may be measured as the average
horizontal distance between the building and rear lot line, provided that the
minimum setback shall not be less than sixty percent (60%) of the rear yard
required by the zoning district.



5.   Double Frontage Lots. Residentially zoned double frontage lots on a
major street, and with no access to that street may have a 25-foot minimum
front yard setback along said street.  All other double frontage lots must
provide full front yard setbacks from each adjacent street.



6.   Satellite Antennas. Antennas with a surface area over 6.3 square feet
which are accessory to a primary use and are designed to receive and transmit
electromagnetic signals, or to receive signals from satellites, shall not be
located within any front yard of the primary use. Such antennas shall be
located no less than fifteen feet from the property line of an adjacent
property within a residential zoning district.



7.   Vision Clearance Zones. No structure, including a fence, shall be
built to a height of more than three feet above the established curb grade on
the part of the lot bounded by the street lines of the streets which
intersect and a line connecting a point on each of such lines thirty feet
from their point of intersection. No landscaping shall be planted in such
area which will materially obstruct the view of drivers approaching the
street intersection.



703   HEIGHT EXCEPTIONS.



These provisions allow exceptions to the height limit of any zoning district
in certain situations.



1.   Vertical Projections. Chimneys, cooling towers, building mechanical
equipment, elevator bulkheads, fire towers, grain elevators, non-parabolic
receiving antennas, tanks, solariums, steeples, penthouses not exceeding 25
percent of total roof area, flag poles, stage towers or scenery lofts, and
water towers may be built to any height in accordance with existing and
future ordinances.



2.   Amateur Radio Towers and Federal Communication Commission
Pronouncements. Radio towers, antennas and other appurtenances operated by
licensed amateur radio operators, where permitted and when, may not exceed 75
feet in height. This height has been determined by the City to reasonably
accommodate amateur service communications, and further represents the
minimum practicable regulation to accomplish legitimate municipal land use
regulation purpose, as recognized under published guidelines of the Federal
Communications Commission.



   A.   Special instances may require that amateur radio tower heights
exceed 75 feet to achieve effective and reliable communications. In such
cases, the Board of Adjustment may grant a Conditional Use Permit to a
licensed amateur radio operator for a specific tower height that exceeds 75
feet.  In determining whether to grant such permission, the City Council
shall consider the federal guidelines contained in PRB-1 (Amateur Radio
Preemption, 101 FCC 2d (1985); codified at C.F.R. Section 97.15(e).



   B.   Such radio towers shall not be located within any front yard of
the primary use.



3.   Broadcast Towers. Broadcast towers, when operated by a
federally-licensed commercial or non-profit organization, may be built to any
height in accordance with existing and future ordinances.  This exception
does not apply to radio towers, antennas and other appurtenances operated by
licensed amateur radio operators.



4.   Civic Buildings. Buildings housing civic use types may be built to a
maximum height of 60 feet.  Such buildings located in residential districts
shall be set back one foot in addition to required setbacks from each
property line for each foot of height over the maximum height of the zoning
district.



5.   Wind Energy Conservation Systems (WECS).



   A.   The distance from all lot lines or any building or power line
to any tower support base of a WECS shall be equal to the sum of the tower
height and the diameter of the rotor. A reduction of this requirement may be
granted as part of a Conditional Use Permit approval if the Planning
Commission finds that the reduction is consistent with public health, safety,
and welfare.



   B.   The distance between the tower support bases of any two WECS
shall be the minimum of five rotor lengths, determined by the size of the
largest rotor.  A reduction of this requirement may be granted as part of a
Conditional Use Permit approval if the Planning Commission finds that the
reduction does not impede the operation of either WECS.



   C.   The WECS operation shall not interfere with radio, television,
computer, or other electronic operations on adjacent properties.



   D.   A fence six feet high with a locking gate shall be placed
around any WECS tower base; or the tower climbing apparatus shall begin no
lower than twelve feet above ground.



   E.   The WECS is exempt from the height restrictions of the base
district.



6.   Conditional Use Approvals. The Board of Adjustment may grant an
exception from the height limit for a zoning district for a Conditional Use
as part of its approval of that use. The limit or extent of this exception
shall be a specific part of the special use permit.



7.   Federal Aviation Administration Rules. No structure may be built in
any zoning district which exceeds the maximum height permitted under the
rules of the Federal Aviation Administration.  These rules describe the
glide angles and operational patterns for any airport within the planning
jurisdiction of the City of Mount Vernon.



704   EXCEPTIONS TO SITE DEVLOPMENT REGULATIONS FOR CREATIVE SUBDIVISIONS.



In the instance that the ordinance provides, the city may authorize such
subdivisions to allow for greater flexibility in the design and development
of subdivisions, in order to produce innovative residential environments, to
provide for more efficient use of land, to protect topography and to
encourage the preservation of common area and open space. These special
regulations and design exceptions apply only to creative subdivisions.



1.   Site Area Per Unit. Unless otherwise provided, the site area per unit
for a creative subdivision as a whole shall be that of the zoning district in
which such subdivision is located.  For the purpose of computing site area
per unit, the area of public streets and private ways within the subdivision
must be excluded.  Residential use types may be combined within the creative
subdivision provided that the subdivision as a whole complies with the
required maximum density of the zoning district.



2.   Perimeter Yards.



   A.   Structures must maintain normal street yard setbacks from any
public streets that form the perimeter of the development.

from any property line that forms the boundary of the development.



3.   Area and Yards for Individual Lots.



   A.   Individual lots within a creative subdivision are exempt from
minimum lot area or yard setback requirements set forth elsewhere in this
Ordinance, unless provided for by the regulations for a specific zoning
district. A creative subdivision must be planned and developed as a common
development.  A minimum separation of twenty (20) feet shall be established
for all residential structures not attached to one another, unless the City
Council grants a specific exception for developments proposing unique
circumstances, only in as much as said development can be demonstrated to
avoid detriment to Mount Vernon's efforts to protect public health, safety,
welfare, community character, property values and aesthetics.



   B.   Any private garage oriented to or facing a public street or
private way internal to the creative subdivision must be set back a minimum
of 25 feet from that public street or private way.



4.   Coverage and Landscaping Requirements. Individual lots in a creative
subdivision are exempt from maximum building and impervious coverage
limitations and street yard landscaping requirements established for the
zoning district.  However, the subdivision as a whole, including streets,
walks, and access ways, must comply with the building and impervious coverage
regulations for its zoning district.



705   FENCE REGULATIONS

other sections of the Mount Vernon Municipal Code, no fence shall be built on
any lot or tract outside the surveyed lot lines, or adjacent to any Municipal
property, excluding public streets.



2.   Required Openings. Unless otherwise provided by this Ordinance or
other sections of the Mount Vernon Municipal Code, any fence built on
residential property within required front or street side yards shall contain

fence.



3.   Sight Obstruction. No solid fence permitted or required by this
article or other sections of the Mount Vernon Municipal Code shall be built

required street yard setback may have a maximum height of six feet.



   C.   Exception to Openness Requirement: Fences built on residential
property other than a required front or street side yards may exceed 50
percent closed construction.



   D.   Exception for Front Yards of Double Frontage Lots: A fence
built within the required front yard of a double frontage lot may be a
maximum of six feet in height and may exceed 50 percent closed construction

Comprehensive Plan or the street planning map of the City of Mount Vernon;
and if such frontage does not provide primary access to the property.



   E.   Materials: Fences shall be constructed of wood, chain-link,
PVC/ resin, metal, stone or masonry materials only. Wood fences shall utilize
standard building lumber only.  Barbed wire and/or electrified fences are

   E.   Electrified fences are not permitted within the jurisdiction of
the City of Mount Vernon.



9.   Fences on Easements. Fences may be constructed within both public and
private utility and drainage easements provided:



   A.   The fence and its design is subject to the approval of the City
Engineer.



   B.   Removal and/or subsequent replacement of the fence or a portion
thereof for the purpose of utilizing the easement shall be at the property
owners expense.



706   APPEALS.



Denial, revocations, or cancellations of a building permit based on the
provisions of this Section may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment, as set
forth in Article 13.



800   ARTICLE EIGHT: LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING REGULATIONS



801   PURPOSE.



The Landscaping and Screening Regulations provide additional guidance on the
development of sites within Mount Vernon by addressing landscaping and
screening requirements. They are designed to improve the appearance of the
community; buffer potentially incompatible land uses from one another; and
conserve the value of properties within the City of Mount Vernon.



802   APPLICABILITY.



The provisions of this section shall apply to all new development on each lot
or site upon application for a building permit, except for the following:



1.   Reconstruction or replacement of a lawfully existing use or structure
following a casualty loss.



2.   Remodeling, rehabilitation, or improvements to existing uses or
structures which do not substantially change the location of structures,
parking, or other site improvements.



3.   Additions or enlargements of existing uses or structures which
increase floor area or impervious coverage area by less than 20 percent. 
Where such additions or enlargements are 20 percent or greater, these
provisions shall apply only to that portion where the new development occurs.



803   LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.



Landscaping shall be required adjacent to each street property line and
within street yards as set forth in Table 804-A.



804   LANDSCAPING MATERIALS AND INSTALLATION STANDARDS.



1.   Official List of Prohibited Plant Materials. No plant material listed
on a list of restricted or prohibited plant materials  provided through the
office of the Zoning Administrator shall be installed in required landscaped
areas or bufferyards. All plant materials shall conform in size, species and
spacing with this section of the ordinance.



2.   Use of Inorganic Landscaping Materials. No artificial trees, shrubs,
plants or turf shall be used to fulfill the minimum requirements for
landscaping. Inorganic materials, such as stone or decorative pavers, may be
used provided that such material does not comprise more than 35% of the
minimum required landscaped area. Other concrete and/or asphalt pavement
surfaces may not be used within the minimum required landscaped area, except
for walkways less than 5 feet in width.

805   BUFFERYARD PROVISIONS.



These provisions apply when use is established in a more intensive zoning
district (District A) which is adjacent to a less intensive zoning district
(District B).  The owner, developer, or operator of the use within District
A shall install and maintain a landscaped bufferyard on his/her lot or site,
as set forth in this section. Bufferyard requirements apply only to those
districts indicated in Table 805-A.  Bufferyards are not required of
single-family, 2-family, duplex, or townhouse use types in the more intensive
zoning district.



1.   The bufferyard dimensions set forth in Table 805-A apply to zoning
districts which share a common lot line or are adjacent but separated by an
intervening alley.

bufferyard set forth in Table 805-A.



3.   Each required bufferyard must be entirely landscaped and free of
paved areas, access ways, storage, or other disturbances.



806   SCREENING STANDARDS.



1.   Application. Screening is required between adjacent zoning districts
indicated in Table 805-A when one or more of the following conditions in the
more intensive zoning district is directly visible from and faces toward the
boundary of the less intensive zoning district:

   E.   Major on-site traffic circulation areas or truck and/or trailer
parking.



   F.   Sources of glare, noise, or other environmental effects.



2.   Opaque Barrier. A six foot opaque barrier shall be provided which
visually screens the conditions listed in Section 806 (1) (A-F) from less
intensive uses as follows:



   A.   A solid wood and/or masonry fence or wall at least six feet in
height.



   B.   A landscaping screen, using evergreen or deciduous materials,
capable of providing a substantially opaque, hedge-like barrier and attaining
a minimum height of six feet within three years of planting.



   C.   A landscaped earth berm with a maximum slope of three to one,
rising no less than six feet above the existing grade of the lot line
separating the zoning districts.



   D.   Any combination of these methods that achieves a cumulative
height of six feet.



3.   Location of Screening Wall. A screening wall or fence shall be
installed no closer to the less intensive zoning district than one-half the
width of the required bufferyard.



4.   Screening: Effect on Drainage. Screening shall not adversely affect
surface water drainage.



5.   Permitted Interruptions of Screening. Screening may be interrupted to
provide access drives to service areas or for loading purposes to buildings.
Such breaks or interruptions shall not exceed 20% of the length of the
required screened area.



807   TREE PLANTINGS.



In any landscaped area for commercial uses only required by the Minimum Depth
Requirements, the Bufferyard Requirements, or the Parking Lot Interior
Landscaping Requirements, one tree of an approved species with a minimum
caliper size of two inches shall be planted and maintained for each 500
square feet of required landscaped area.  Existing trees approved for
preservation shall be counted toward satisfaction of this requirement.



808   GENERAL PROVISIONS.



1.   Time of Application. The provisions contained in this Article shall
be applied for each individual lot or site when an application for a building
permit on such lot is made. When required, a Landscape Plan shall be
submitted with each application for a building permit.  Such plan shall be
reviewed by the Zoning Administrator for compliance with the provisions of
this section.



2.   Maintenance of Required Landscaping. Upon installation of required
landscape materials, each owner shall take appropriate actions to ensure
their continued health and maintenance. Required landscaping that does not
remain healthy shall be replaced consistent with this Article.



3.   Obstruction of View. Landscaping or screening installed in any
landscaped area shall not obstruct the view from or to any driveway approach,
street, alley, or sidewalk.



4.   Earth Berm Locations. All earth berm locations shall be reviewed by
the Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee to determine how the berms
shall relate to drainage and public utilities.



5.       Exceptions. A development may continue to comply with the
bufferyard and screening requirements in effect at the time of issuance of
its original permit, regardless of whether an adjacent lot or site is
subsequently rezoned to a less intensive district which would otherwise
require compliance with bufferyard or screening provisions.



900   ARTICLE NINE: OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS



901   PURPOSE.



The Off-Street Parking Regulations require that developments provide parking
in proportion to the need created by each use. The regulations further
establish standards for the functional design of parking facilities. These
regulations are intended to accommodate vehicles in a functionally
satisfactory manner and to minimize external effects on neighboring
properties.



902   GENERAL APPLICATIONS



1.   Applicability. Off-street parking shall be provided for any new
building constructed; for new uses or conversions of existing buildings; or
for enlargements of existing structures.



2.   Exemptions. Any use within the CB / TC Town Center District other
than Uptown Residential is exempt from the off-street parking requirements
provided by Section 903. Any off-street parking facility constructed in the
CB / TC District after the effective date of this Ordinance must comply with
the design standards set forth in this Article.



903   SCHEDULE OF OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.



Parking facilities for each use shall be provided in accord with the minimum
requirements set forth in Table 903-A.



1.   Computation. When a computation of required parking results in a
fraction of 0.5 or greater, the requirement shall be rounded up to the next
whole number.



2.   Gross Floor Area. Unless otherwise indicated, parking requirements
are based on gross floor area.  Gross floor areas for the purpose of this
calculation exclude any interior space used for the parking or loading of
vehicles.



3.   Capacity. When parking requirements are computed on the basis of
capacity, capacity shall be determined by the building code or other official
determinations of occupancy in effect for the City of Mount Vernon at the
time the use is established.

1000   ARTICLE TEN: SIGN REGULATIONS



1001   PURPOSE.



The Sign Regulations provide standards for communicating information in the
environment of the City of Mount Vernon and its jurisdiction. The historic
and architectural value and quality of Mount Vernon is particularly important
to the city's future.  Street graphics and signs have a significant impact
on the overall appearance and visual quality of the community. Therefore, it
is essential that the style, quality, and design of signs support the city's
overall quality and reflect its historic character. In addition, signs can
have a significant impact on the value and economic stability of adjacent
properties.  Therefore, sign design must reflect the basic value that
development on one site must preserve the integrity of neighboring sites.



The purpose of this article is to provide minimum standards to safeguard
life, health, property, and public welfare, and to preserve the character of
the city by regulating the size, sign height, design, quality of materials,
construction, location, lighting, and maintenance of signs and sign
structures not enclosed within a building, and to accomplish the following:



1.   Encourage a desirable city character with a minimum of clutter, while
recognizing the need for signs as a major form of communication;



2.   Provide for fair and equal treatment of all sign uses;



3.   Encourage signs that are well designed and pleasing in appearance, as
well as variety, design relationship, spacing, and location;



4.   Provide for maximum public convenience by properly directing people
to various activities, and;



5.   Promote public safety by providing that official traffic regulation
devices be easily visible and free from nearby obstructions, including, but
not limited to, blinking signs, excess number of signs, or signs resembling
official traffic signs.



1002   OBJECTIVES.



This article is also intended to assist in achieving the following objectives:



1.   To authorize the use of signs which are:



   A.   Compatible with their surroundings and the zoning district;



   B.   Appropriate to the type of activity;



   C.   Expressive of the identity of the proprietors; and



   D.   Legible in the circumstances.



2.   To foster high quality commercial development and to enhance the
economic vitality of existing businesses by promoting the reasonable,
orderly, and effective display of signs, and to encourage better
communication with the public.



3.   To encourage sound, proper display practices and to mitigate the
objectionable effects of competition with respect to the size and placement
of signs.



4.   To enhance the physical appearance of the City of Mount Vernon by
protecting the built environment and natural beauty of the area.



5.   To protect pedestrians and motorists from damage or injury that might
result from improper construction, placement, or use of signs.



6.   To protect the public by reducing the obstructions and distractions
that might cause traffic accidents.



7.   To preserve the value of private property by assuring the
compatibility of signs with nearby land uses.



8.   To preserve and enhance the natural beauty and unique character of
the City of Mount Vernon.



9.   To promote convenience, enjoyment, and free flow of traffic within
the City of Mount Vernon.



10.   To protect the public's ability to identify uses and premises
without confusion.

4.     Projecting Signs.



   A.   Projecting signs permitted within the CB, TC or UC Districts
shall be limited to shingle-type signs.



   B.   Maximum Size: Eight square foot maximum total area for each
side of the sign.



   C.   One such sign shall be allowed for each business front and
shall be adjacent to the business which it identifies.



   D.   No such sign may be internally illuminated.



   E.   Each projecting sign must maintain at least the following
vertical clearance:



      (a)   8 feet over sidewalks or landscaped areas.



      (b)   15 feet over parking lots.



      (c)   18 feet over alleys or driveways.



      (d)   The maximum projection may not exceed 5 feet.



5.   Wall Signs.



   A.   No wall sign shall wholly or partly cover any wall opening or
distinctive architectural feature.



   B.   A wall sign shall not extend beyond the ends or top of the
building wall to which it is attached.



   C.   A wall sign attached to a building on its front property line
may encroach upon public right-of-way by no more than 12 inches. Such a wall
sign shall provide minimum clearance of eight feet.



   D.   Each wall sign shall be safely and securely attached to the
building wall.



1006   ILLUMINATION.



1.   Signs shall only be illuminated internally or indirectly.



2.   Illumination, when installed for the purpose of lighting a specific
sign or group of signs, must be positioned in such a manner that light is not
directed at an adjoining property or at a public street or highway.



3.   In all districts, except GC and BP, with all lighting components
energized, the lighting intensity of any sign, whether resulting from
internal or external illumination, shall not exceed 600 LUX  (see Note 1
below) when measured with a hand-held incident light meter - designed to
measure illuminance - held at a distance of one foot from the sign face or
the window surface in front of the sign if the sign is inside and facing out.
If other illuminated signs are present, the sign being read should be
shielded as much as possible.  For signs behind windows, a piece of
cardboard held against the window at a point close to the edge of the sign
being measured reasonably shields the light from other signs.  For signs
outside, a piece of cardboard held near the edge of the sign being measured
and separating it from adjacent signs will act as sufficient shielding.



4.   Maximum brightness levels for electronic signs shall not exceed 4,000
nits (see Note 2 below) when measured from the sign's face at its maximum
brightness during daylight hours and 500 nits when measured from the sign's
face at its maximum brightness between dusk and dawn.



5.   No illumination shall be anything other than a steady, continuous
burning, and where necessary properly shielded, light source. Bare bulbs are
prohibited.  Flashing, blinking, oscillating, rotating or intermittent
turning on-and-off of any illuminating device is prohibited. Time/weather
informational signs and official warning and regulatory signs erected by the
city or state are exempt from this regulation.



6.   Neon shall be considered indirect illumination and not a bare bulb.



Note 1: LUX is a measure of the illumination of a surface from a point
source.  In this case, the surface is the bulb on an incident light meter
and the point source is the sign. The light from the sign illuminates the
meter at some measurable level. This is what we use as a standard for smaller
signs.



Note 2: The NIT is a non-SI unit of visible light intensity - the amount of
light emitted from a particular area or surface - used by the sign industry
in the US - the SI equivalent is one candela per square meter.  It is an
indicator of how bright a surface will appear. The nit is a rather small unit
of brightness -- an LCD computer screen has an output of about 200-300 nit.
The night-time standard set in this ordinance is about 1 ½ times as bright
as a typical computer screen; the day-time standard is about 13 times
brighter than this same screen. Sign companies can easily calculate the nit
values for any given illuminated sign - these are part of the sign
specifications.  We use this to measure the brightness of electronic signs -
message boards, LCD screens, and the like. See earlier definition of
electronic signs.



1007   METHOD OF MEASUREMENT FOR REGULATORS.



1.   Maximum Permitted Sign Area. Maximum permitted sign area for a
premises is set forth as a numerical limit or as a function of the frontage
of the premises on a street or private way.  The maximum permitted sign area
includes the aggregated area for all types of signs combined on a premises,
unless otherwise exempted. For properties with frontage on more than one
street or private way, the total frontage shall be calculated as the longest
frontage plus one-half the length of all additional frontages.



2.   Double Faced Signs. The area of double-faced signs is calculated on
the largest face only.



3.   Setback. All parts of a sign must meet all setback regulations,
unless allowed otherwise (i.e. projected signs).



1008   BULK REQUIREMENTS.



1.   Table 1010-A sets forth the sign types permitted within each zoning
district of the City of Mount Vernon.



2.   Table 1010-B sets forth auxiliary design elements permitted within
each zoning district of the City of Mount Vernon.  In specific cases where
an auxiliary design element otherwise prohibited produces a sign of special
design character that does not otherwise negatively affect surrounding
properties, the City Council may grant permission for the use of such
elements.



3.   Table 1010-C sets forth the maximum sign area permitted within each
zoning district of the City of Mount Vernon.



4.   Table 1010-D sets forth the maximum permitted numbers of signs per
premise; the maximum permitted dimensions of each sign; and the required
setbacks for detached signs.



1009   GENERAL PERMIT PROCEDURES



1.   Applicability. Any installation or expansion of any sign under this

1100   ARTICLE ELEVEN: OUTDOOR LIGHTING REGULATIONS



1101   PURPOSE AND INTENT.



To protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City’s
residents, and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare,
comfort and convenience of its residents, the provisions of this chapter are
intended to minimize glare, and light trespass and establish regulations for
outdoor lighting in the zoning districts: Town Center, Limited Commercial,
General Commercial, Business Park, Light Industrial, Agricultural, and Urban
Corridor (also known as Mixed Use Corridor). All outdoor recreation
facilities including the recreation facilities of the City of Mount Vernon,
Cornell College and Mount Vernon Community School District are also covered
by this chapter. This chapter does not include areas zoned as residential.
All outdoor lighting shall be installed with the idea of being a “good
neighbor,” to keep unnecessary direct light from shining onto abutting
properties or streets.



This chapter is not intended to provide a dark sky ordinance, but instead
encourages lighting practices that will reduce light pollution referenced and
defined as over illumination, glare, light trespass and sky glow. It also
sets standards for outdoor lighting so that its use does not interfere with
the reasonable use and enjoyment of property within the City. It is
recognized that this chapter might need to be revised to accommodate lighting
designs and fixtures that are newly developed after the adoption of this
chapter.



1102   DEFINITIONS.



For the purposes of this chapter, terms used shall be defined as follows:



1.   After Hours Lighting. Standard light levels during the hours of 10
p.m. and 6 a.m. through the means of a control system or systems for outdoor
general area lighting.



2.   Average Light Level. The overall average of all points on the surface
of the illuminated area including the brightest and dimmest points.



3.   Candlepower. Luminous intensity of a light in a specified direction
measured in candelas (cd) (e.g., an ordinary wax candle has a candlepower of
one candela).



4.   Cut Off Angle (of a Luminaire). The angle, measured up from nadir,
between the vertical axis and the first line of sight at which the light
source is not visible, displayed as follows:







5.   Cutoff Fixture. A luminaire, which has a light distribution where the
candlepower does not exceed 2.5% of the lamps’ rated initial lumen output
at an angle of 90 degrees above nadir, and does not exceed 10% of the
lamps’ rated initial lumen output at a vertical angle of 80 degrees above
nadir. This applies to all lateral angles around the luminaire.



6.   Color Rendering Index (CRI). A measurement comparing the color of an
object under a light source to a reference light source of comparable
temperature. CRI values generally range from 0 – 100.  As the CRI
approaches 100, the color of the lit object becomes truer or closer to the
original color. See Appendix for chart.



7.   Foot-candle (fc). A unit of illumination when one lumen is evenly
distributed on a one square foot area.



8.   Forward Throw. Any down light luminaire whose distribution pattern is
Type IV (as defined by the IESNA). These luminaires have minimal backlight
effect thereby reducing light trespass.



9.   Full Cutoff Fixture. A luminaire, which has a light distribution
where the candlepower does not exceed 0% of the lamps’ rated initial lumen
output at an angle of 90 degrees above nadir, and does not exceed 10% of the
lamps’ rated initial lumen output at a vertical angle of 80 degrees above
nadir. This applies to all lateral angles around the luminaire.



10.   Glare. An extreme contrast between bright and dark areas in the
field of view.



11.   Horizontal Foot-candles. The amount of light being received on a
horizontal surface such as roadway or parking lot pavement, measured at the
target surface.



12.   HID. High Intensity Discharge lamps.



13.   IESNA. The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America.



14.   Illuminance. Lumens per unit area of incident on a surface, measured
in Foot-candles (1fc = 1 lm/sf).



15.   Illumination. An alternative term for illuminance most commonly used
to avoid confusion between illuminance and luminance. (e.g., it can be used
in a qualitative sense to designate the act of illuminating or quantitatively
by stating level of illumination).



16.   Initial Lumens. Lumens rating for a brand new light bulb (light
output diminishes over the life of a bulb).



17.   Light Trespass. Light falling beyond the intended target area where
the light is not wanted or needed, including by way of illustration, but not
necessarily limited to, across property boundaries.



18.   Lumen (lm). A measure of light energy generated by a light source.
(e.g., 1800 lumens is the approximate equivalent to a 100 watt incandescent
bulb).



19.   Luminaire. A complete lighting unit consisting of a lamp or lamps
together with the components designed to distribute the light, such as
reflectors, refractors, lenses, etc.



20.   Luminance. The luminous intensity of a surface in a given direction
per unit of projected area. (e.g., candela/SF). This is not to be confused
with ILLUMINANCE. See candlepower definition.



21.   Maximum Light Levels. The brightest point on the surface of the
illuminated area.



22.   Minimum Light Levels. The dimmest point on the surface of the
illuminated area.



23.   Mounting Height. The vertical distance from the face of the
luminaire to the surface area intended to be lit.



24.   Nadir. The vertical line projecting downward to the ground from the
center of the lens of a luminaire.



25.   Over Illumination. The light level in excess of the standard light
set forth in this chapter.



26.   Sky Glow. The “glow” effect that is visible above highly
illuminated areas.



27.   Standard Light Levels.  Maximum light level approved for the
property.



28.   Uniformity Ratio. The ratio of average illumination to minimum
illumination within a given area.



29.   Vertical Foot-candles. The amount of light being received on a
vertical surface such as a billboard or building facade, measured at the
target surface.



1103   GENERAL REGULATIONS.



1.   After Hours Lighting. The standard light levels between the hours of
10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. shall be reduced by 60%.  Businesses open between
10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. are exempt, however they must comply with the
requirements of this chapter within one hour after closing. For the purposes
of security, businesses may install motion detectors to allow the temporary
increase of illumination to the before 10:00 p.m. level.



2.   Mounting Heights. The luminaire mounting height shall be limited to a
maximum of fifteen (15) feet in Town Center and Urban Corridor or when placed
within 50 feet of a residential zoning district. In all other zoning
districts, luminaire mounting height shall not be more than thirty (30) feet
with the exception of sports lighting which shall follow IESNA guidelines.



3.   Light Sources. The use of incandescent lamps or low pressure sodium
mercury vapor HID lamps shall not be permitted for outdoor lighting.



1104   LIGHT TRESPASS.



1.   When a light source originating on a legally described parcel of land
with one of the following zoning designations (CB, TC, LC, GC, BP, LI, AG) is
adjoining a legally described parcel of land with one of the following zoning
designations (SR, NR, TR, or UC), the illumination at adjoining property
lines shall not exceed 0.5 horizontal foot-candles and 2.0 vertical
foot-candles.



2.   When a light source originating on a legally described parcel of land
with one of the following zoning designations (CB, TC, LC, GC, BP, LI, AG, or
HR) is adjoining a legally described parcel of land with one of those same
zoning designations (CB, TC, LC, GC, BP, LI, AG, or HR), the illumination at
adjoining property lines shall not exceed 1.0 horizontal foot-candles and 4.0
vertical foot-candles.



3.   When a light source originating on a legally described parcel of land
with the following zoning designations (UC) is adjoining a legally described
parcel of land with that same zoning designation (UC), the illumination at
adjoining property lines shall not exceed 0.5 horizontal foot-candles and 1.0
vertical foot-candles.



4.   Compliance Methods: Methods of complying with the requirements
include, by way of illustration, but are not necessarily limited to, fixture
shielding, directional control designed into the fixture, fixture location,
fixture height, and fixture aim.



1105   CONTROL OF GLARE - LUMINAIRE DESIGN.



Any luminaire rated at more than 1800 lumens, shall be a full cut-off fixture
with the exception of those used for lighting recreational facilities.



1106   BUILDINGS AND VERTICAL STRUCTURES.



Luminaires intended to illuminate buildings and other vertical structures,
excluding signs (see Article 10: Signs) shall:



1.   Be located within five (5) feet of the building or vertical structure
that is being illuminated and be aimed in any direction;



2.   Not allow illumination to extend beyond the intended building or
vertical structure;



3.   Not exceed an average maintained vertical foot candle measurement of
ten (10); and



4.   Not have a vertical foot candle measurement that exceeds thirty (30).



1107   PARKING LOT AND WALKWAY LIGHTING.



Full-cutoff luminaires must be used in parking areas, along internal streets,
and along pedestrian ways. To promote a unified development theme, historic
luminaires (also referred to as period lighting) may be used as an alternate
if they have built-in reflectors that effectively eliminate uplight. Except
as provided in this chapter, all other luminaires must be directed downward
and the light source must be shielded so that it is not visible from any
adjacent property.



1.   Maximum average lighting levels. Average lighting levels must not
exceed the standards provided for in Table 1107-A. Standards for Foot-Candles
(below). For those areas not specified, the Planning and Zoning Commission
must work with the applicant to set an appropriate level on a case-by-case
basis in keeping with the intent of this chapter.

2.   Maximum uniformity ratio. In all parking areas and along sidewalks
and other pedestrian walkways, a uniformity ratio of 6:1 or lower (i.e. 4:1)
must be maintained. The intention is to remove extreme light or dark areas.



3.   Color or light –Kelvin– –Range–.  In all parking areas and
along sidewalks and other pedestrian walkways, lighting must measure between
3,500-4,500 Kelvin.



4.   Lighting along walkways should be mounted no more than 12 feet above
the walkway. Parking lot lighting in town center and urban corridor must be
mounted no more than 15 feet above the surface of the parking lot.



1108   LIGHTING OF EXTERIOR DISPLAY/SALES AREAS.



Lighting levels on exterior display/sales areas shall be adequate to
facilitate the activities taking place in such locations. The applicant shall
designate areas to be considered display/sales areas and areas to be used as
parking or passive vehicle storage areas. This designation must be approved
by the Zoning Administrator.



1.   Areas designated as parking or passive vehicle storage areas shall be
illuminated in accordance with the requirements for parking areas in parking
lot and walkway lighting #2.



2.   Areas designated as exterior display/sales shall be illuminated so
that the average horizontal illuminance at grade level is no more than thirty
(30) foot-candles.



1109   CANOPY LIGHTING.



Lighting associated with a canopy used for a vehicular shelter must meet the
following standards:



1.    Luminaires beneath a canopy must be either a full-cutoff luminaire
or mounted so the luminaire or lens, whichever is lower, does not project
below the bottom of the canopy surface.



2.   The sides or top of the canopy must not be illuminated, except as
permitted by the Mount Vernon Sign Ordinance.



3.   Lighting installed beneath a canopy must be pointed downward and
substantially confined to the ground surface directly beneath the perimeter
of the canopy.



4.   Areas around the pump islands and under canopies shall be illuminated
so that the minimum horizontal illuminance at grade level is at least 1.0
foot-candle and no more than 5.5 foot candles.  The uniformity ratio shall
be no greater than 4:1, which yields an average illumination level of no more
than 22.0 foot candles.



5.   Lighting beyond the perimeter of the canopy must be consistent with
the lighting standards for parking areas.



1110   STREET LIGHTING.



Street lighting owned, operated, maintained or leased by the City of Mount
Vernon shall be exempt. The City Council may establish via resolution
guidelines for public lighting.



1111   RECREATIONAL FACILITIES.



Lighted recreational facilities shall satisfy the requirements set forth in
the most current editions of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North
America (IESNA) RP-6 Recommended Practice for Sports and Recreational Area
Lighting and the IESNA Lighting Handbook. Appropriate lighting criteria shall
be selected based on the Class of Play of the facility and participants as
defined by the IESNA.



1.   No outdoor recreational facility, public or private, shall be
illuminated after 11:00 p.m. except to conclude a specific activity, which is
in progress under such illumination prior to 11:00 p.m.



2.   Luminaires shall be installed to meet the criteria of a Cutoff
Fixture.



3.   Luminaires shall be aimed no greater than a distance two (2) mounting
heights or less from the base of the pole (a maximum angle of 63 degrees up
from nadir or a minimum of 27 degrees down from horizontal.



4.   Light Trespass attributable to the recreational facility lighting
system shall not exceed one-half (0.5) initial horizontal foot-candles and
two (2.0) initial vertical Foot-candles on adjacent properties within a
residential zoning district, except public ways.



5.   Initial illumination levels shall not exceed the target levels
specified by the IESNA by more than 30% to account for light loss factors
such as lamp lumen depreciation and luminaire dirt depreciation.



1112   SPECIAL LIGHT SOURCES.



1.   Laser Source Light. The use of laser source light or any similar high
intensity light is prohibited.

1203   NONCONFORMING LOTS AND LEGAL LOTS OF RECORD.



Nonconforming lots are lots or parcels of land that do not meet the minimum
lot width, length or area requirements of this Ordinance for permitted uses
in the zoning district in which the lot or parcel is located.  Nonconforming
lots or parcels shall not be built on, except for those nonconforming lots or
parcels that are legal lots of record. A nonconforming lot or parcel is
considered a legal lot of record if any of the following conditions are met:

2.   Residual Parcels. Any residual parcel that was reduced from a lot on
a single deed that was legally recorded in the office of the County Recorder
prior to the adoption of this chapter or from any lot legally created under
ordinances in effect prior to the adoption of this chapter, and was created
by a taking or dedication for a public right-of-way or public purposes, or
was reduced pursuant to a court order; or



3.   Enlarged Parcels. Any parcel that was enlarged from a lot on a single
deed that was legally recorded in the office of the County Recorder prior to
the adoption of this chapter or from any lot legally created under ordinances
in effect prior to the adoption of this chapter, voluntarily or pursuant to a

4.   Bisected Lots. Any lot that was legally recorded in the office of the
County Recorder prior to the adoption of this chapter or from any lot legally
created under ordinances in effect prior to the adoption of this chapter, and
remains as a single lot but is rendered nonconforming by a taking or
dedication for a public right-of-way or public purposes; or



5.   Lots Legally Permitted Under Prior Ordinances. Any lot legally
created under ordinances in effect prior to the adoption of this chapter.

These regulations apply to buildings and structures which were constructed
legally under regulations in effect before the effective date of this
Ordinance.



1.   Continuation.    A lawful nonconforming structure existing on the
effective date of this Ordinance may be continued, repaired, maintained, or
altered, subject to the provisions of this Section.

nonconforming structure may be added to or enlarged if the addition satisfies
one or more of the following conditions:

the existing building, complies with all applicable setback, height,
off-street parking, and landscaping requirements.

the site are not increased and the building, after the addition, conforms to
height and off-street parking regulations applicable to its zoning district.



   C.    No permitted addition to a nonconforming structure may place a
wall within ten feet of a window of an adjacent pre-existing residential
structure.



3.   Moving of Nonconforming Structures. A lawful nonconforming building
or structure shall not be moved in whole or in part to another location on
its lot unless every part of the structure conforms to all site development
regulations applicable to its zoning district.



4.   Repair of Nonconforming Structures. A lawful nonconforming building
damaged by fire, explosion, storm or other calamity, except flood damages,
may be repaired and reconstructed provided there is no increase in the degree
of nonconformity.  Repair and reconstruction within the designated
floodplain shall be in conformance with Floodplain development regulations.



5.   Conversion of a Conforming Building. A conforming building shall not
be changed in any way that will result in a nonconforming development.

period of six months, any subsequent use must conform to all use regulations
applicable to the property's zoning district.



4.   Change of Use. A lawful nonconforming use may be changed only to a
use type permitted in a zoning district that is equal to or less intensive
than that normally required for the previous use.



5.       Allowance for Repairs. Repairs and maintenance of a structure
occupied by a nonconforming use may be made, provided that no structural
alterations are made other than those required by law.



6.   Damage or Destruction of Structures. Should a structure occupied by a
lawful nonconforming use be damaged to the extent that the cost of
restoration exceeds 50 percent of the replacement cost of the structure, the
nonconforming use shall no longer be permitted.



7.   Nonconforming Uses and Conditional Use Permits. A lawful pre-existing
use which would require a Conditional Use Permit in its zoning district shall
be presumed to have the appropriate Permit and shall be considered a
conforming use. The use shall be subject to the regulations governing lapses
or revocation of Permits, set forth in Article 13.



1300   ARTICLE THIRTEEN: ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURES



1301   PURPOSE.

implementation of the Zoning Ordinance. These provisions include procedures
for reviewing specific uses within certain zoning districts; amending the
Zoning Ordinance; and granting variances.



1302   SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURE.



The Site Plan Review Procedure provides for the administrative review in
addition to plan review required by other sections of the Mount Vernon Code
of Ordinances of projects that have potentially significant effects on
traffic circulation or a significant effect on land uses in adjacent
neighborhoods. The procedure provides for review and evaluation of site
development features and possible mitigation of unfavorable effects on
surrounding property.  This review supplements and does not replace any
existing reviews or approvals required under this or other ordinances.



1.   Administration. The Zoning Administrator, with the assistance of
other City staff, shall review, evaluate, and act on all site plans submitted
pursuant to this procedure and be responsible for timely submittal to and
consideration of all site plans by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the
City Council.



2.   Uses Requiring Site Plan Review. All uses, except single-family
residential, duplex residential, and all permitted agricultural uses, are
subject to the Site Plan Review Procedure. No building permit will be issued
for such uses unless the site plan is approved by the City Council.



3.   Application Requirements. An application for a Site Plan Review shall
be filed with the Zoning Administrator by the owner of a property or the
owner’s authorized agent. The application shall include the following
information:



   A.   Name and address of the applicant.



   B.   Owner, address, and legal description of the property.



   C.   A description of the nature and operating characteristics of
the proposed use.



   D.   A site plan, drawn to a scale sufficient to permit adequate
review and dimensioned as necessary, showing the following information:



      (a)   The date, scale, north point, title, name of owner, and
name of person preparing the site plan.



      (b)   The location and dimensions of boundary lines,
easements, and required yards and setbacks of existing and proposed buildings
and site improvements.



      (c)   The location, size, and use of proposed and existing
structures on the site.



      (d)   The location of all proposed site improvements,
including parking and loading areas, pedestrian and vehicular access, sewers,
sidewalks, utilities, service areas, fencing, screening, landscaping, and
lighting, with enough detail to demonstrate conformance with City codes.



      (e)   Location of any major site feature, including drainage
and contours at no greater than five foot intervals.



      (f)   Any other information that may be required for review by
the Zoning Administrator.



4.   Review and Evaluation. The Zoning Administrator shall review and make
the following findings in a report to the Planning and Zoning Commission and
the City Council on the site plan based on the criteria established in Table
1313-A and conformance with applicable regulations in this Zoning Ordinance:



   A.   The proposed development, together with any necessary
modifications, is compatible with the criteria established in Table 1313-A.



   B.   Any required modifications to the site plan are reasonable and
are the minimum necessary to minimize potentially unfavorable effects.



   C.   The site plan conforms to the Zoning Ordinance and other
applicable City ordinances.



   D.    The Planning and Zoning Commission shall make its
recommendation to the City Council to approve, approve with conditions or
disapprove the site plan.



5.   Modification of Site Plan. The Zoning Administrator, the Planning and
Zoning Commission, or the City Council may require modification of a site
plan as a prerequisite for approval. Required modifications may be more
restrictive than base district regulations and may include, but are not be
limited to, additional landscaping or screening; installation of erosion
control measures and control of storm runoff as required by the Code of Iowa;
improvement of access or circulation; rearrangement of structures on the
site; or other modifications deemed necessary to protect the public health,
safety, welfare, community character, property values, and/or aesthetics.



6.   Term and Modification of Approval.



   A.    A Site Plan Approval shall become void one year after the date
of approval, unless the applicant is issued a Building Permit.



   B.    The Zoning Administrator may approve an application to modify a
previously approved site plan if he/she determines that the modification does
not affect findings related to the criteria set forth in Table 1313-B and is
either minor in its essence or an improvement to the approved site plan.



   C.    The Zoning Administrator may revoke a Site Plan Approval if
he/she determines that the development is not complying with the terms and
conditions of the approval. Such revocation may be appealed to the City
Council. The City Council shall consider the appeal at the first available
meeting after the filing of the appeal.



7.   Approval to Run With Land. An approval pursuant to this section shall
run with the land until the expiration date of such approval.

1305   APPLICATIONS AND APPROVALS.



1.   Applications for Certificates of Appropriateness.



   A.   No individual or corporation shall undertake a change in
appearance of a structure or site, as so defined, within a designated
historic district, nor shall the Building Official issue a regulated permit
for a change in appearance of a structure or site, unless a certificate of
appropriateness or a certificate of no material effect has been granted.



   B.   The Historic Preservation Commission may issue a Certificate of
No Material Effect if the work contemplated in the application will have no
effect on any significant architectural features of the structure or on the
historic district.



   C.   Application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be made
to the Building Official using the approved standardized application form
available at City Hall. The application must include all items listed on the
application form to questions as to assist the Historic Preservation
Commission in their consideration of the application. Applications that do
not contain all of the required items may be turned back to the applicant for
more information prior to review of the application by the Historic
Preservation Commission.



      (a)   If the change in appearance described in the application
requires a regulated permit issued by the City, the application for
certificate of appropriateness requires mandatory review by the Historic
Preservation Commission and mandatory compliance by the applicant, as set
forth herein.



      (b)    If the change in appearance described in the
application for certificate of appropriateness does not require the issuance
of a regulated permit by the City, the application for certificate of
appropriateness requires mandatory review by the Historic Preservation
Commission, but compliance with the decision of the Historic Preservation
Commission by the applicant shall be voluntary.



   D.   Upon the filing of such application, the Building Official
shall immediately notify the Historic Preservation Commission of the receipt
of such application and shall transmit it together with accompanying plans
and other information to the Commission, unless the application pertains
solely to the interior of the structure.



   E.   All applications received before the closing date, to be
established by the Historic Preservation Commission, shall be considered by
the Historic Preservation Commission at its next scheduled meeting. The
Historic Preservation Commission shall review the application, according to
the duties and powers specified herein. In reviewing the application the
Historic Preservation Commission may confer with the applicant or the
applicant's authorized representative. In acting upon an application the
Historic Preservation Commission shall consider whether the change in
appearance to a structure or site proposed by the application conforms to
standards set forth in the current edition of the Secretary of the Interior's
"Standards for Rehabilitation" or the Commission's published "City of Mt.
Vernon Design Booklet."



   F.   The Historic Preservation Commission shall approve, modify, or
disapprove the application. The findings of the Commission on each
application shall be contained in a written resolution setting forth the full
reason for its decision and the vote of each member participating therein.
Such resolution shall be placed on file for public inspection in the office
of the City Clerk within five (5) business days after the meeting at which
the application was acted upon. Thereafter, a copy of the resolution shall be
sent to the applicant by ordinary mail. If the application is approved or
approved with modifications acceptable to the applicant, a certificate of
appropriateness will be issued, signed by the chairperson, and immediately
transmitted along with the application to the Building Official. If the
application is disapproved, it will be immediately transmitted, along with
the written resolution of the Historic Preservation Commission's findings, to
the Building Official.



   G.   Any party aggrieved by any decision of the Historic
Preservation Commission may appeal the action to the City Council. Such an
appeal must be in writing and must be filed with the City Administrator no
later than ten (10) business days after the filing of the aforementioned
decision. The City Council shall, within a reasonable amount of time, give
public notice thereof as well as notice to the applicant and to the
appellant, hear the appeal and decide the appeal. In deciding such appeals,
the City Council shall consider whether the Commission has exercised its
powers and followed the guidelines established by law and this article, and
whether the Commission's action was patently arbitrary or capricious. In
exercising the above-mentioned powers the City Council may, in conformity
with the provisions of this article, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from
and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to
be made, and to that end shall have the powers of the Historic Preservation
Commission from whom the appeal is taken.



   H.   If not satisfied with the decision of the City Council, any
aggrieved party may appeal within sixty (60) days of the City Council's
decision to the Iowa District Court.



   I.   Certificates of Appropriateness and Certificates of No Material
Effect issued on the basis of approved applications authorize only changes in
appearance set forth in such approved applications and no other changes in
appearance. It shall be the duty of the Building Official or his/her designee
to inspect from time to time any work performed pursuant to such a
certificate to ensure compliance with the requirements of such certificate.
If it is found that such work is not being carried out in accordance with the
certificate, the Building Official shall issue a stop-work order.



2.   Remedy of Dangerous Conditions.



   A.   Except for emergencies as determined by the Building Official
pursuant to the ordinances of the City, City enforcement agencies and
departments shall give the Historic Preservation Commission at least thirty
(30) days' notice of any proposed order which may affect the exterior
features of any structure for remedying conditions determined to be dangerous
to life, health or property.



   B.   The Historic Preservation Commission shall have the power to
require that changes or alterations not adversely affect the exterior
features of a structure in cases where the danger to life, health or property
may be abated without detracting from the exterior features of the structure.
In such cases, it shall be the responsibility of the Historic Preservation
Commission and the City agency or department to cooperate with the property

the site of the original foundation.

the provisions of any zoning regulation, requests for interpretation of any
map.



4.   Variances to Relieve Hardships Relating to Property. To authorize,
upon appeal, variances from the strict application of this Ordinance where by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece
of property at the time of enactment of the zoning regulations; or by reason
of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional
situation or condition of such piece of property, such strict application
would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or
exceptional and undue hardships upon the owner of such property.



   A.   Requirements for Grant of a Variance. No such variance shall be
authorized by the Board unless it finds that all of the following are met:



      (a)   Strict application of the zoning ordinance will produce
undue hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by
other properties in the same district under the terms of this ordinance.



      (b)   Such hardship is not shared generally by other
properties in the same zoning district and in the same vicinity.



      (c)   The authorization of such variance will not be of
substantial detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district
will not be changed by the granting of the variance.



      (d)   The granting of such variance is based upon reason of
demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for
purposes of convenience, profit, or caprice.



      (e)   The condition or situation of the property concerned is
not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable a
general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this Zoning Ordinance.



      (f)   The granting of the variance will not cause substantial
detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and
purpose of any Ordinance or Resolution.



   B.   Findings by Board. The Board of Adjustment shall make findings
that the requirements of Section 1308-4-A-(a-f) have been met by the
applicant for a variance.



   C.   Conditions for Grant of Variance:



      (a)   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this Ordinance and punishable under Chapter 4, Mount Vernon Code of
Ordinances.



      (b)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment
grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this
Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this Ordinance in said district.



      (c)   No non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures,
or buildings in the same district and no permitted or non-conforming use of
lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered
grounds for the issuance of a variance.



5.   Board has Powers of Zoning Administrator on Appeals: Reversing
Decisions of Zoning Administrator. In exercising the above mentioned powers,
the Board of Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the

the order, requirement, decisions, or determination as ought to be made, and
to that end shall have the powers of the Zoning Administrator from whom the
appeal is taken.



The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirements, decision, or determination of the Zoning

in the application of this ordinance.



6.   Procedure for Appeals. Appeals shall be made to the Board of
Adjustment through the office of the Zoning Administrator in written form as
determined by the Zoning Administrator. The Board shall fix a reasonable time
for the hearing of the appeal and shall decide the appeal within 30 days of
the date of the public hearing. An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the action, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the
Board that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in
his/her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.



   A.   The Board shall provide a minimum of ten day’s notice of a
public hearing on any question before it.  Notice of the hearing shall be

166.06 -Procedures



The purpose of this Article is to establish procedures for subdivision
applications and for review and action on applications by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and the City Council.  The procedures are designed to
assure adequate review and consideration of subdivision applications, while
providing for an orderly and expeditious approval process.  The Article
provides procedures for the approval of two types of subdivisions: Minor
Subdivisions and Major Subdivisions.



166.07   Minor Subdivisions



a.   Scope



The Minor Subdivision procedure may be used when a proposed subdivision meets
all of the following conditions:



1.   The subdivision adjusts the lot lines of two or more lots without
creating additional lots; or creates no more than four lots from any single
parcel, tract, or lot. A subdivision plat is not required when a minor
boundary change is approved in accordance with Section 166.07A and other
applicable provisions of the Code and is not in conflict with the laws of the
State of Iowa.



2.    The subdivision is served by existing utilities and does not require
the extension of streets, utilities, or public improvements.



3.    Each lot resulting from the subdivision procedure will conform fully
to all requirements of the zoning district that pertain to the lots; and each
lot is developable according to the site development regulations of the
zoning ordinance.



4.    No part of the parcel has been the subject of a previous Minor
Subdivision or Minor Subdivision approval.



b.    Application and Approval Procedure



An application for a Minor Subdivision may be approved under the following
procedure:



1.   The applicant submits an application on a form established by the
City and including the supporting documents required for Minor Subdivisions
in Table 166-1. These documents shall include a plat of all lots and parcels
that are affected by the action, prepared by a Licensed Surveyor. The
subdivider shall prepare and file with the Clerk twenty (20) copies of the
plat conforming in detail to the requirements set forth in Table 166-l.



2.   The Planning and Zoning Commission, following proper notice, shall
hold a public hearing on each Minor Subdivision application and, following
such public hearing, shall take action on the application and plat. Action
taken by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be sent on to the City
Council for their action.



3.   The Council shall consider and act upon the application and plat and
the Commission's recommendation not later than the second regular meeting or
30 days following the date of filing by the Commission, whichever is later.
In the event of disapproval, the Council shall refer the plat back to the
Commission along with specific reasons for such disapproval, a copy of which
shall be transmitted to the subdivider.



4.   The Planning and Zoning Commission retains the right to disapprove or
not act on the Minor Subdivision application. In the event of such action,
the application may proceed through the Major Subdivision process.




5.   Applications, reviews and approvals of minor subdivisions shall
follow the same schedule as Major Subdivisions shown in section 166.08.

approval of minor changes to the boundaries of parcels between owners of two
adjacent parcels of land without subdividing the parcel or parcels as minor
or major subdivisions as set out in Sections 166.07 and 166.08.



a.  Scope



The Minor Boundary Change procedure may be used when all of the following
conditions are met:



1.   The minor boundary change does not create any additional lots or
parcels.



2.   The minor boundary change does not cause the need for the extension
of streets, utilities, or any other additional public improvements.

are located; and each lot or parcel is developable according to the site
development regulations of the zoning and subdivision ordinances.



5.   The owners demonstrate that all site and structure requirements for
the zoning district in which the parcels of land are located can be
maintained after the sale or exchange of property.

Applications shall include a completed application form (prepared by the City
Engineer); the Plat of Survey; a Minor Site Plan and the necessary supporting
documents as established by Table 166-1A; and an application filing fee as
established by the City Council.  The owners shall prepare and file with the
Clerk twenty (20) copies of the plat and related documents.



1.   The Plat of Survey shall be prepared by a land surveyor licensed by
the State of Iowa and shall encompass the outside boundary of all parcels
adjusted.



2.   Prior to consideration of the application, the parcels must be staked
to show existing and proposed property lines so that city officials may
verify dimensions on said site plan.



c.   Review and Approval Procedure. An application for a minor boundary
change shall be considered under the following procedure.



1.   Upon completion of review by staff, the Planning and Zoning
Commission, following proper notice, shall hold a public hearing on each
boundary change application and, following such public hearing, shall take
action on the application by recommending approval or disapproval of the
application.  The application, along with the recommendation of the Planning
and Zoning Commission, shall then be forwarded to the City Council for action.

Council shall refer the plat back to the owners along with specific reasons
for such disapproval, a copy of which shall be transmitted to the
Commission.  In the event of such action, the application may proceed
through the Minor or Major Subdivision processes. 



3.   Applications, reviews, and approvals of minor boundary changes shall
follow the same schedule as Major Subdivisions shown in section 166.08.

The Major Subdivision procedures apply to all subdivisions not approved or
eligible for approval under the Minor Subdivision procedures. In general,
these include subdivisions that: 1) are not approved under the Minor
Subdivision procedure; 2) create more than four lots; or 3) require
development or extension of public improvements.



b.    Stages in the Approval Process



The approval process for Major Subdivisions consists of three stages: the
pre-application stage, the preliminary plat stage, and the final plat stage.



c.    Pre-application Procedures



1.   Before filing an application for preliminary plat approval, the
applicant shall request a planning conference for the purpose of determining
the general requirements for proposing a subdivision and the feasibility of
proceeding with the preparation of a preliminary plat. When the proposed area
to be subdivided will be developed in multiple plats, a concept plan shall be
prepared to show the intended use of the total parcel.



2.   The subdivider shall then prepare and file with the Clerk twenty (20)
copies of a preliminary plat conforming in detail to the requirements set
forth in this chapter.



3.   The Clerk shall forthwith refer one (1) copy to the City
Administrator, the City Engineer, the City Attorney, the Zoning
Administrator, the Planning & Zoning Commission Chair, and the Parks and
Recreation Chair.  One copy shall be kept and be available for public
inspection.



4.   The City Engineer shall carefully examine said plat as to its
compliance with the laws and ordinances of the City, the existing street
system, good engineering practices, and shall, as soon as possible, submit
findings in duplicate to the Commission. Submissions of the plat by the
subdivider and staff reviews shall be completed according to the following
timetable:

5.   After receiving the City Administrator's, City Engineer's and City
Attorney's reports, the Commission shall study the preliminary plat and other
material for conformity thereof to the requirements of this chapter and the
Comprehensive Plan for the development of the City. The Commission may confer
with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of
such improvements to be made by the subdivider. The Commission shall approve
or reject such a plat within forty-five (45) days after the date of
submission thereof to the Commission, unless the plat is tabled with the
consent of the subdivider for a period not to exceed an additional sixty (60)
days for further study by the Commission or to await further recommendations.
The approval of the preliminary plat by the Commission shall be null and void
unless a final plat of either the entire proposed subdivision or a portion of
it is presented to the Commission within one year after date of preliminary
plat approval.




6.   Before a public hearing on the proposed plat, notice shall be
provided by the subdivider at the subdivider's expense:



a.   By publication in a local newspaper of general distribution after the
subdivider provides the necessary information to the City and the City
requests the publication;



b.   By posting a notice on the tract that is easily visible from each
adjoining street with a sign(s) not less than eighteen inches in height and
twenty-four inches in width with a white background and black letters not
less than one and one-half inches in height; and



c.   By sending notices by mail to all property owners within 300 feet.



Such notice shall be given at least ten days prior to the public hearing.



7.   The Commission shall, after such consideration, transmit forthwith a
copy of the preliminary plat along with all supporting papers to the Council
along with the Commission's recommendation to approve or disapprove the
preliminary plat.  Any restrictive covenants shall be included with the
supporting papers.



8.   If the subdivider finds it necessary to make material and substantial
alterations in any layout of the subdivision after conditional approval from
the Commission, such alterations shall be subject to the approval of the
Commission and the Council.



9.   The Council shall consider and act upon the preliminary plat and the
Commission's recommendation not later than the second regular meeting or 30
days following the date of filing by the Commission, whichever is later. In
the event of disapproval, the Council shall refer the plat back to the
Commission along with specific reasons for such disapproval, a copy of which
shall be transmitted to the subdivider.



10.   Approval of the preliminary plat does not constitute approval of the
subdivision. However, it shall form the basis for approval of the final plat
if such final plat is prepared and construction is undertaken in conformity
with this chapter and in substantial conformance with the approved
preliminary plat and plans and specifications prepared subsequent to its
approval.



11.   Approval by the Council of the preliminary plat shall not   
constitute authority to sell lots or record the plat, nor shall it constitute
authority to construct permanent buildings in reliance upon the preliminary
layout.



12.   Upon approval of the preliminary plat by the Council, the subdivider
may proceed with the preparation of the final plat together with detailed
construction drawings and specifications for the public improvements required
under this chapter, and all required legal documents.



13.   Before submitting the final plat to the Commission for approval, the
subdivider shall furnish:



a.   All documents requiring signatures shall be signed including the
Subdivision Agreement;



b.   The restrictive covenants, if any, or a statement certifying that
there will be no restrictive covenants;



c.   All construction plans and specifications, as listed in Section
166.12 of this chapter, necessary for the detailed engineering consideration
of the improvements required under this chapter and obtain approval of the
City Engineer. All final plats and construction plans submitted for review
and approval shall be submitted no later than the first day of the month in
which the Planning and Zoning Commission will meet and consider the plat.



14.   After the final plat and accompanying legal documents are filed with
the City, the Commission shall consider the final plat at the regular meeting
and shall recommend either approval or disapproval of the plat. If the
Commission finds that the final plat has been prepared in compliance with
these regulations and in substantial compliance with the preliminary plat,
such final plat shall be recommended for approval. If the Commission finds
otherwise, the Commission shall recommend disapproval and, further, shall
specify its reasons for recommending disapproval.  The Commission shall
within fourteen (14) days transmit to the Council the final plat along with
its recommendation and all accompanying documents.



15.   All of the required public improvements shall be constructed
according to the City of Mount Vernon's Public Improvement Design Standards
and accepted by formal Resolution of the Council. Before passage of said
resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer shall report that said
improvements have been constructed in conformance with the City Public
Improvement Design Standards, and have been certified as complete by the
developer's engineer. Final plat approval shall require the subdivider to
post a performance bond, guaranteeing that said improvements will be
constructed within one year from final acceptance of the plat, or before a
certificate of occupancy is requested, as provided by Section 166.17(d).
However, final approval of the plat will not guarantee final acceptance of
the subdivision until such improvements have been completed and accepted by
the City. The above arrangements shall be subject to review by the City staff
prior to acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been
completed, and no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such
improvements have been completed and accepted by the City. The above
arrangements shall be subject to review by the City staff prior to
acceptance, and shall specifically assure the expedient installation and
completion of all improvements within the specified construction time period
and shall indemnify the City from any and all costs or losses of the
development due to the delay in construction completion and building permit
issuance.



16.   The Council shall consider the final plat along with the report of
the Commission and the City Engineer not later than the second regular
meeting following the date of filing with the Council, provided that the
public improvements have been completed or a bond has been filed with the
City, guaranteeing the completion of the improvements.  If the Council finds
that the plat has been prepared in compliance with the regulations of this
chapter and in substantial compliance with the preliminary plat and
construction plans, such final plat shall be approved.  In the event of
disapproval, the record shall show the specific points on which the final
plat varies from these regulations and/or the preliminary plat.



17.   The passage of a resolution by the Council accepting the plat shall
constitute final approval of the platting of the area shown on the final
plat, but the subdivider or owner shall cause such plat to be recorded in the
office of the County Recorder, as provided in Chapter 354, Code of Iowa, and
shall file satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the City
Clerk before the City shall recognize the plat as being in full force and
effect.  Unless this recording occurs within 180 days after the approval by
the Council, the resolution is null and void.



18.   Until the final plat has been recorded and evidence of recording
provided to the City, and until the public improvements, including but not
limited to streets, water, sewer, sidewalks, and storm sewer, have been
constructed and approved by the City or a bond provided, NO LOTS SHALL BE
SOLD AND NO BUILDING PERMITS SHALL BE ISSUED.



19.   Phased Subdivisions:  The final plat may be submitted in phases,
provided that no phase represents the lesser of 5 lots or 10% of the total
number of lots in the entire approved preliminary plat.  The initial phase
of the final plat must be submitted according to the effective dates
established above.  In the event of a phased subdivision, the initial
preliminary plat approval remains effective for a period not to exceed three
years, unless otherwise extended by the City Council.



20.   The Council may waive the requirements of this chapter for the
construction and installation of some or all of the improvements in cases of
dedications of land or rights-of-way to public use where such dedication is
in excess of the needs of the subdivision and is desired by a public agency
in lieu of a purchase or condemnation.



166.09   Planning conference



The subdivider or a representative shall request a planning conference in
advance of the preliminary plat preparation in order to discuss the proposed
subdivision and to obtain information as to the requirements necessary for
approval of the plat. The purpose of the planning conference is informational
only, and no approval can be given nor can any requirements of this chapter
be waived. Participants in the planning conference, in addition to the
subdivider or agent or engineer may be: one (1) member of the City Council,
designated by the Mayor; one (1) member of the Commission, designated by the
Chairperson of said commission; one (1) member of the Parks and Recreation
Board, designated by the Chairperson of said board; the Zoning Administrator;
the City Administrator, City Attorney and City Engineer or any other official
of government deemed to have an interest in the layout or facilities to be
furnished in the subdivision. The subdivider may wish to prepare for such a
conference some or all of the following materials, which may later be used in
preparing a preliminary plat:



1    A legal description of the parcel to be subdivided, if available.



2.   A layperson’s description identifying the location of the  parcel.

shown to controlling lines appearing on the earlier plat to permit an overlay
to be made.  Re-subdivisions shall be labeled as such in a subtitle
following the name of the subdivision wherever the name appears on the plat.



6.   Outside boundaries of the subdivided land shall be shown as well as
sufficient survey data to positively describe the bounds of every lot, block,
street, easement, or other areas shown on the plat including all interior
excepted parcels. Those boundary lines of the proposed subdivision that are
coincidental with adjacent property lines and/or adjacent subdivision shall
be resolved by field survey to avoid any gaps or overlaps of ownership and
description. The boundary lines thus located shall comprise the basis of a
legal description of the property and shall encompass that area of
subdivision, which shall be computed to the nearest one-hundredth  (0.01) of
an acre.



7.   The course of every boundary line shown on the plat shall be
indicated by a direct bearing reference or by an angle between the boundary
line and an intersecting line having a shown bearing, except when the
boundary line has an irregular or constantly changing course, as along a body
of water, or when the description of the boundary line is better achieved by
measurements shown at points or intervals along a meander line having a shown
course. All bearings and angles shown should be given to at least the nearest
minute of arc.



8.   Curve data shall be stated in terms of radius (R=), central angle (D
=), tangent (T=), arc length (A=), and chord (Ch=). All points of curvature
(P.C.) and points of tangency (P.T.) shall be located and labeled.

line, the major portion of that lot or subdivision shall be enclosed by a
meander line showing complete data with distances along all lines extending
beyond the enclosure to the irregular boundary shown with as much certainty
as can be determined.  In all cases, the true boundary shall be clearly
indicated on the plat.



10.   Lots shall be numbered consecutively. All lot lines shall be
dimensioned to the nearest 100th of a foot. The bearings or corner angles of
all lot lines not parallel to the block lines shall be shown and lines
intersecting a curved line shall be labeled as whether radial or not radial.
Dimensions of curved lot lines shall include appropriate curve data. The area
of all nonrectangular lots shall be shown to the nearest 100 square feet.



11.   Centerlines of all street right-of-ways shall be designated and
dimensions from angle point to angle point, point of curvature to point of
tangency, intersection to intersection, or any combinations thereof between
intersections with the appropriate bearings, angles, curve data, right-of-way
widths and distances clearly shown.



12.   Easement for public utilities and drainage facilities shall be
designated and appropriately labeled with reserved width and type of
“easement.”



13.   Fractional section lines and corners of the government township and
section surveys shall be appropriately labeled and dimensioned as applicable
to the plat. All plats shall be tied to a known section or fractional corner
by distances and bearings or angles.



14.   Types of designation lines used shall be as follows:



a.   Boundary lines by a heavy line of long dash (--), two dots, etc., and
labeled "Plat Boundary."



b.   Block lines by heavy solid lines.



c.   Centerlines of all street right-of-ways by a fine line of long dash
(--) short dash or dot, or other  accepted method.



d.   Easements by fine line of medium length dashes.



15   All areas dedicated to the public must be clearly shown and purpose
indicated.



16.    Street names, location, lot number designation and right-of-way
width for all streets within or abutting the plat shall be shown.



17.   Private restrictions and trusteeships and their periods of
existence, if any. Should these be of such lengths as to make the lettering
of same on plat impractical and thus necessitate the preparation of a
separate instrument, reference to such instrument shall be made on the plat.



c.   Accompanying Material



1.   A deed to the City properly executed for all streets intended as
public streets and for any other property intended for public use. (See

166.12  Design Standards



The following are standards for the design of a subdivision.  For additional
information and requirements, refer to the zoning and subdivision ordinances
in this chapter for information and requirements relating to the adopted
Public Improvement Design Standards.  The subdivision design standards
contained herein are intended only as minimum requirements so that the
general arrangement and layout of a subdivision may be adjusted to a wide
variety of circumstances.  However, in the design and development of the
plats and construction plans the subdivider should use standards consistent
with the site conditions and the City Public Improvement Design Standards so
as to assure an economical, pleasant and durable neighborhood.



a.   Character of Development. 



The Commission shall have the right to consult with the subdivider regarding
the type and character of development that will be permitted in the
subdivision, and may require that certain minimum regulations regarding this
matter be incorporated in the restrictive covenants. Such provisions shall be
intended to protect the character and value of the surrounding development
and shall also tend to secure the most appropriate character of the
development in accordance with long-range projections of the Comprehensive
Plan.



b.   Preservation of Scenic, Historic, and Natural Features



1.   Existing features which would add value to residential development,
such as trees, watercourses, historic and archeological sites and similar
irreplaceable assets, shall be shown on the preliminary plat and shall be
preserved, insofar as possible.



2.   To the maximum extent possible, development shall be located to
preserve natural features of the site, to avoid areas of environmental
sensitivity, and to minimize negative impact and alteration of natural
features and drainage patterns.



3.   The subdivider shall give maximum consideration to the preservation
of the following areas as open space, to the extent consistent with
reasonable utilization of land:




(a)   Wetlands and other unique environmental areas.



(b)   Significant stands or mature specimens of trees.



(c)   Flood plain lands, other than areas that have already experienced
substantial development.



(d)   Slopes in excess of 15% as measured over a 10-foot interval.



(e)   Habitats of endangered species.



4.    Land Suitability.  Land which the City has found to be unsuitable
for subdivision due to potential flooding, drainage problems or other
features likely to be harmful to the general health, safety and welfare of
the future residents shall not be subdivided, unless satisfactory methods of
development for such lands are formulated by the developer and approved by
the Commission, the Council and any other official governmental body having
jurisdiction.  Major waterways and ditches shall not be straightened or
channelized without a plan for storm water management and erosion control
measures.



c.   General Guidelines for Subdivision Layout



Subdivisions shall be designed to comply with the following overall
performance objectives:



1.    Avoidance of adverse effects on ground water and aquifer recharge.



2.    Reduction and minimizing of cut and fill.



3.    Avoidance or reduction of unnecessary impervious surfaces.



4.    Prevention of flooding and encroachment of water onto other
properties.



5.    Provision of adequate access to lots, including alternative routes
to lots and sites within the subdivision and minimizing of cul-de-sacs.



6.    Mitigation of negative environmental effects on surrounding
properties, including effects of shadow, noise, odor, traffic, drainage, and
utilities.



7.   Respect for the urban character and traditional layout of Mount
Vernon, including providing continuity to established street and community
facility networks; establishing linkages and connections between new
development and existing parts of the city; and preserving historically and
architecturally significant sites and buildings, determined as those sites or
districts either listed on or determined to be eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places, as determined by the State Historic
Preservation Officer or the Mount Vernon Historic Preservation Commission.



8.   Dedication of arterial, collector, and key local streets on the
general alignments specified in the Comprehensive Plan or the street planning
map.



9.   The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall take the
above Site Design objectives into account during their review and approval of
preliminary plat applications.



d.   Blocks



Pedestrian ways may be required to allow access through the block for
pedestrians in very long blocks. In general, blocks of more than six hundred
feet (600') in length should have a pedestrian way near the center of the
block. Blocks in TR Traditional Residential zoning districts should not
ordinarily exceed 300 feet in length.



e.     Easements



1.   An easement for utilities, at least sixteen feet (16’) in width,
centered on the lot lines, shall be provided along the rear line of each lot,
and along side lines where necessary to provide a continuous easement.  If
necessary easements of  greater width may be required along lot lines or
across lots, and easements of lesser width may be approved if accepted by
utility companies and easements shall connect with easements in adjoining
properties.  Easements shall be approved in writing by any public or private
utility company intending to use such easement for their facilities, such
approval to be submitted prior to approval of the final plat.



2.   Whenever any stream or important surface water course is located in
an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider shall, at his or her own
expense, make adequate provision for improvement of the channel so it will
properly carry the increased surface water runoff from developed ground and
shall provide and dedicate to the City an easement along each side of the
stream.  Such easements shall be for the purpose of improving, maintaining
or protecting the stream.  Easements shall extend not less than twenty feet
(20’) on each side of the centerline of the waterway, and the total width
of the easement shall be adequate to cover the 100 year flood flow calculated
for a fully developed drainage basin upstream.



f.     Lots



1.   Each lot shall conform in size and shape to the requirements set
forth in the Zoning Ordinance as necessary for providing an adequate building
site.



2.   Each lot shall be provided by means of a public street with
satisfactory access to an existing public street.



3.   Each lot shall be provided with not less than twenty feet (20’) of
access frontage to a public street.



4.   For the purpose of complying with minimum health standards, in
subdivisions where buildings are to be served by septic tanks, the size of
lots shall be sufficiently large to accommodate adequate drainage fields. 
Standards set forth by the Linn County Health Department and the State Board
of Health shall be met.



5.   Side lot lines where possible shall be at right angles or radial to
the street lines.



g.     Monuments



Monuments shall be placed at block corners, points of curves, change in
direction along lot lines, and at each lot corner.  All monuments shall be
of solid steel, not less than 1/2 inch diameter and thirty inches (30”)
long, and properly marked with the license number of the land surveyor
responsible for the subdivision.



166.13  Subdivision Design Categories and Special Regulations



a.    Purpose



The purpose of this section is to establish design alternatives that provide
greater flexibility in subdivision design and make potential development more
consistent with the City's site design objectives and the special natural and
artificial features of the City of Mount Vernon and its planning jurisdiction.



b.    Subdivision Design Categories



1.    Conventional Subdivision:  A conventional subdivision literally
meets all nominal standards of the zoning and subdivision ordinances for lot
dimensions, setbacks, street frontage, and other site development
regulations.  Conventional subdivisions generally develop in areas
relatively free of environmental constraints.



2.    Creative Subdivision:  A creative subdivision complies with the
overall density requirements of a zoning district, but allows internal
variations of such standards as lot size, setbacks, and street width in order
to encourage innovative or economical development or protect natural features
and open space without loss of economic yield to developer.



c.     Land Efficient Subdivisions: Types and Special Regulations



Creative Subdivisions are divided into two types: Land Efficient 
Subdivisions and Traditional Neighborhood Subdivisions.



1.    Land Efficient Subdivisions



(a)    Land Efficient (LE) subdivisions allow the clustering or grouping
of residential lots in order to provide common open space.



(b)    Land Efficient Subdivisions may be developed and approved subject
to the following standards and variations:



(1)   The overall density of subdivision complies with the zoning district
that contains the final subdivision.  A subdivider may apply for a rezoning
simultaneously with the plat approval process.



(2)   Individual lot size dimensions, including lot width, may be reduced
up to 60% of requirement of zoning  district.  Any savings on lot size
shall be devoted to common open space or other approved community facilities.



(3)   Lot setbacks may be varied from those otherwise specified for the
zoning district.  Setback limits must be established on the preliminary and
final plat.  The setback from any garage entrance to any circulation way
must be at least 20 feet.



(4)   Street or right-of-way widths set forth in Table 166-3 may be varied
within for local streets within Land Efficient Subdivisions, subject to the
sole discretion of the approving authorities.



(5)  Articles of incorporation or covenants for a homeowners' association or
other provision assuring maintenance or operation of all common spaces shall
be submitted with subdivision application.



2.    Traditional Neighborhood Subdivisions



(a)    Traditional Neighborhood Subdivisions (TN) allow the development of
urban neighborhoods that produce new development consistent with the patterns
of historic or traditional parts of Mount Vernon, with appropriate civic
space; or provide for the recreation of neighborhoods that follow the
patterns of other traditional towns.  Approval of a Traditional Neighborhood
Subdivision requires submission of a specific district plan.



(b)   TN Subdivisions may be developed and approved subject to the
following standards and variations:



(1)    The minimum size parcel to be covered by the TN Subdivision is 10
acres.



(2)   The overall density of subdivision complies with the zoning district
that contains the final subdivision. A subdivider may apply for a rezoning
simultaneously with the plat approval process.



(3)   Individual lot size dimensions, including minimum width, may be
reduced to 80% of the requirement of the underlying zoning district.  Any
savings on lot size shall be devoted to public space, including but not
limited to town squares, small parks, greenways, and community facilities.



(4)   All streets within a TN Subdivision connect to other streets within
the district, forming a continuous network.  The internal street system
connects to other streets on the edge of the district.



(5)   Lot setbacks may be varied from those otherwise specified for the
zoning district.  Setback limits must be established on the preliminary and
final plat.  The setback from any garage entrance to any circulation way,
including an alley, must be at least 20 feet.  Garage access from the rear
of lots by way of an alley may be permitted within a TN Subdivision.



(6)   Retail, service, civic, office, and various types of residential
land uses may be combined within a TN subdivision, notwithstanding the use
regulations of the underlying zoning district.  The distribution and
location of land uses shall be consistent with the TN Plan submitted for the
subdivision.



(7)   Street or right-of-way widths set forth in Table 166-4 may be varied
within for local streets within TR Subdivisions, subject to the sole
discretion of the approving authorities.




(8)   A TN Subdivision Plan, in addition to other documents required by
this Ordinance, must accompany all applications for a TN Subdivision. This
plan shall illustrate the distribution of land uses throughout the
subdivision; the location and design of public spaces, streets, and alleys;
the location and nature of special design features; architectural controls;
and other information necessary to communicate the concept of the TN
subdivision. The TN Subdivision Plan shall be a part of the approved
subdivision. The City shall issue subsequent building and development permits
only in consistency with the TN Subdivision Plan.



(9)   Articles of incorporation and/or covenants for a homeowners'
association or other provision assuring maintenance or operation of all
common spaces shall be submitted with subdivision application.



166.14  Circulation System Design



a.   Roadway System Design



1.   The road system shall be designed to permit safe and orderly movement
of traffic, to meet but not exceed needs of the present and future served
population; to be simple and logical; to respect natural features,
topography, and landscape, and to present an attractive streetscape.



2.    The system shall conform to the official City street planning map
and the general principles of the City's Comprehensive Plan.  For streets
not shown on the Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of streets shall provide
for the logical extension of existing streets.



3.   The street network of a subdivision should provide for logical,
continuous extensions of streets to subsequent later developments.  Such
extensions shall make provision when necessary with a temporary turnaround
with a radius of at least 50 feet.



4.   The system shall provide adequate traffic flow through a subdivision
and provide at least two routes from each lot within the subdivision to the
rest of the City, except as explicitly permitted by the approving authorities.



5.    The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the approving
agencies that the distribution of traffic created by the subdivision will not
exceed the design capacity of the proposed street system and its individual
segments.



6.   The categories, functions, and projected traffic loads of the street
hierarchy are set forth in Table 166-2.



b.    Pedestrian and Bicycle Systems



1.    A continuous pedestrian system shall be provided within each
subdivision, designed to conduct pedestrians between every point in the
subdivision in a safe manner.  Subdivisions designated for industrial uses
are exempt from this requirement.



2.   In conventional subdivisions, the pedestrian system will ordinarily
be provided by sidewalks placed parallel to and on both sides of each street,
with exceptions permitted to preserve natural features, create visual
interest, or maintain greenways and pedestrian ways proposed in the
Comprehensive Plan.



3.   In creative subdivisions, the pedestrian system may be an independent
network diverging from streets but providing continuous pedestrian access
between all points.



4.    All aspects of the pedestrian system, including sidewalks and
intersection crossings, must be designed to comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act.



5.   Bikeways or recreational trails when required by the Subdivision
Agreement shall be credited toward the satisfaction of pedestrian system and
open space standards set forth by this ordinance.



c.    Pavement Width



1.    Pavement width for each street classification is determined by
parking and curbing requirements based on form or intensity of adjacent
development.



2.    Streets shall have a width and cross section as recommended in the
Comprehensive Plan or the street planning map for the type of street
involved.  Final street paving and right-of-way widths shall meet City
Public Improvement Design Standards.  To promote economical development of
streets, minimum pavement width should generally be used.



3.   Partial width streets will normally be discouraged, except where they
may be required to complete the remaining portion of a street already
dedicated or where the Comprehensive Plan or the street planning map
indicates that the alignment of street will straddle the property line.



d.    Curbs, Gutters, and Shoulders



1.   Curbing shall be required for the purposes of safety, drainage, and
protection of the pavement edge, as set forth in Table 166-4.



2.    Requirements for curbs vary according to street function and the
nature of adjacent development.  Adjacent development is defined as urban or
rural as follows:



(a)   Rural:  Residential or predominately agricultural land use where
average lot frontage exceeds 150 feet.



(b)   Urban:  Residential land use where average lot frontage is less
than or equal to 150 feet; or adjacent land uses include commercial, office,
industrial, or civic use types.



3.    Where curbing is not required, edge definition and stabilization
shall be provided.



4.    Where curbing is required, shoulders and drainage swales may be used
only if soils or topography make the provision of shoulders preferable to
curbs; or where the character of an area is preserved by the use of shoulders
and drainage swales.



5.    Shoulders, when developed, shall be at least eight feet in width on
each side for all streets; and located within right-of-way.  Swale width is
site-specific.  Shoulders shall consist of stabilized turf or other
acceptable material.



6.   All curbs shall provide ramps for accessibility by handicapped people
consistent with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.



7.    Curb construction shall follow standards established by the City of
Mount Vernon.



e.    Sidewalks



1.   Sidewalk requirements are determined by road classification and
intensity of development, as set forth in Table 166-4.



2.   Where sidewalks are not otherwise required by Table 166-4, the City
may require their installation if necessary to provide access to generators
of pedestrian traffic or major community features; to continue a walk on an
adjacent street; to link parts of the city; or to accommodate future
development.



3.    In conventional development, sidewalks shall be placed generally
parallel to streets within right-of-way.  Exceptions are possible to
preserve important natural features or to accommodate topography or
vegetation; when applicant shows an alternative for a safe and convenient
pedestrian system; or in creative subdivisions.



4.    In commercial areas, sidewalks may abut curb.



5.    Pedestrian easements at least 12 feet in width may be required
through the center of blocks over 600 feet in length if deemed necessary by
the approving authorities to provide access to schools or community
facilities; or to maintain a continuous pedestrian network within and between
subdivisions and districts of the City of Mount Vernon and its jurisdiction.



6.    Sidewalks shall provide a clear path of at least four feet in width,
free of any obstructions.



7.   All sidewalks shall be constructed according to current standards in
use by the City of Mount Vernon. Sidewalks shall be of concrete construction
four inches thick except at points of vehicular crossing where they shall be
six inches thick.



8.    All sidewalks, crossings, and other segments of a continuous
pedestrian system must comply with standards of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.



f.    Bikeways and Recreational Trails



1.    Bikeways and recreational trails shall be required in subdivisions
only when specified as part of the Comprehensive Plan.



2.    All off-street recreational trails shall be a minimum of eight feet
in width for two-way traffic and comply with the Americans with Disabilities
Act.  Surfacing of trails shall be acceptable to the City of Mount Vernon. 
Gradients for bikeways and recreational trails should not exceed five
percent, except for short distances.



3.    Recreational trails may satisfy part of the requirements of this
ordinance for sidewalks or open space.



4.    All residential streets shall utilize bicycle safe drainage grates
at storm sewer inlets.



g.    Right-of-Way



1.    Measurement:  The right-of-way of a street shall be measured from
lot line to lot line, and shall be wide enough to contain the roadway, curbs
or shoulder, sidewalks and sidewalk setbacks, other necessary graded areas,
and utilities.



2.    Any right-of-way that continues an existing street shall be no less
than that of existing street.



3.   The requirements for right-of-ways for functional categories of roads
is set forth in Table 166-4.



4.    Dedications:  Dedications of right-of-way for collector,
subcollector, community, or arterial streets shall be made consistent with
the Comprehensive Development Plan.



h.     Alleys



Alleys may be required in business areas and industrial districts for
adequate access to block interiors and for off-street loading and parking
purposes. Alleys may be approved in residential districts.  Dead-end alleys
shall be provided with a means of turning around at their terminus.



i.   Street System Design Standards



1.    Pavement



All streets shall be paved to comply with the Public Improvement Design
Standards of the City of Mount Vernon.



2.    Continuity of Arterial or Collector Streets



No subdivision shall prevent the extension of arterial or collector streets
through and beyond the subdivision.  The subdivider may plan and design
collector streets not designated in the Comprehensive Plan or the street
planning map, subject to the approval of the City Council.



3.    Cul-de-sacs



(a)   Cul-de-sac streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall
not exceed 300 feet in length from the first through street to the turnaround
and shall be designed so that vision from entrance to end is not restricted.



(b)   The closed end of a cul-de-sac within a conventional subdivision
shall have a turnaround with a street property line diameter of at least 110
feet in residential subdivisions.  This diameter may be increased by the
Planning and Zoning Commission if deemed necessary in the case of a
commercial or industrial subdivision.



(c)   Cu1-de-sacs should generally be avoided in subdivisions.



4.   Street Grades



Streets and alleys shall be completed to grades having been officially
determined or approved by the City Engineer. All streets shall be graded to
the full width of the right-of-way and adjacent side slopes graded to blend
with the natural ground level. The maximum grade shall not exceed those
published in the City Public Improvement Design Standards.



5.    Street Intersections



(a)   Streets shall intersect as nearly at right angles as possible,
unless limited by topography, existing street alignments, or other clearly
defined constraints, as provided for in theCity’s Public Improvement Design
Standards.



(b)   In most cases, no more than two streets should intersect at a single
intersection.



(c)   New intersections along one side of an existing or proposed street
shall, if possible, align with intersections on the other side of the
street.  Offsets between adjacent intersections shall measure at least 150
feet between centerlines.



(d)   Intersection design standards are set forth in the Public
Improvement Design Standards.



6.    Block Size



(a)   The length, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be suited to the
proposed land use and design of the proposed subdivision. Blocks within
subdivisions in the TR Traditional Residential zoning district should not
ordinarily exceed 300 feet in length. Blocks in other districts will be
defined by the definitions contained within the Comprehensive Plan. Blocks
within rural subdivisions shall not exceed 1,320 feet.



7.   Access to Major Arterials



When a new subdivision, except where justified by limiting conditions,
involves frontage on a heavy trafficway, the street layout shall provide
motor access to such frontage by one of the following means:



(a)   A parallel street supplying frontage for lots backing onto the
trafficway.



(b)   A series of cul-de-sacs or short loops entered from and planned at
right angles to such a parallel street, with their terminal lots backing onto
the highways.



(c)   A frontage road separated by a planting strip from the highway to
which a motor access from the frontage road is provided at points suitably
spaced.



(d)   A service drive or alley at the rear of the lots.



Where any one of the above mentioned arrangements is used, deed covenants or
other means should prevent residential driveways from having direct access to
the trafficway.



In general, streets shall be platted with appropriate regard for topography,
creeks, wooded areas and other natural features lending themselves to
attractive treatment.



9.   Railroads.



  If a railroad is adjacent to or otherwise affects the design or street
layout of the subdivision, the subdivision plat should:



(a)   Be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade
separations at highway crossings of the railroad.



(b)   Border the railroad with a parallel street at a sufficient distance
from it to permit deep lots to back on to the railroad; or form a buffer
strip for park, commercial, or industrial use.



(c)   Provide cul-de-sacs at right angles to the railroad so as to permit
lots to back on the railroad.



10.   Street Names.



All newly platted streets shall be named and in a manner conforming to the
prevailing street naming system. A proposed street that is obviously in
alignment with other existing streets as indicated on the  street planning
map, or with a street that may logically be extended although the various
portions be at a considerable distance from each other, shall bear the same
name. Names of new streets shall be subject to the approval of the City
Council in order to avoid duplication or close similarity of names, while at
the same time providing for consistent and appropriate street names.



11.   Street Tree Planting.



Trees may be planted on the parking of all newly platted streets in
conformance with the Code of Ordinances, City of Mt. Vernon, Iowa. 



12.   Other design standards shall be as set forth in the Public
Improvement Design Standards.



j.   Utility Locations in Public Right-Of-Ways



1.   See Exhibit A. The standard location drawing for public utilities
constructed within the street right-of-way shall be in conformance with
current City of Mt.Vernon building design standards.  Utilities shall be
constructed in those locations in so far as possible.



2.   Sanitary sewers shall be constructed outside of the street pavement
areas in the right-of-way or adjacent to the right-of-way in public sewer
easements.

  Residential Street

 

Function Type




Lane, Court, or Cul-de-sac

 

Street providing private or controlled access to no more than twelve housing
units.




Local

 

Provides frontage to lots and carries traffic with origin or destination on
the street itself. Carries least traffic at lowest speed. Local residential
streets usually do not interconnect with adjoining neighborhoods or
subdivisions.




  Collector

 

Conducts and distributes traffic between local streets and major streets in
the community. Carries larger volume of traffic. Residential collectors
interconnect and provide through access between residential neighborhoods.
Collector streets should preserve one through traffic lane in each direction,
without encroachment by parking.




  Minor Arterials

 

Provides community wide access between residential neighborhoods and to other
activity centers in Mount Vernon, including uptown and major commercial
facilities. Minor arterial streets should preserve one through traffic lane
in each direction, without encroachment by parking.




  Major Arterials

 

Inter-regional road in the street hierarchy. Conveys traffic between activity
centers, often at high speeds and with limited access. Should be excluded
from residential areas.

166.15   Public Improvements




a.   Responsibility for Installation and Warranty



It is the intent of the City that all development within areas designated for
urban development within the City of Mount Vernon's Comprehensive Plan shall
be connected to public utilities. The subdivider shall be responsible for the
installation and/or construction of all improvements required by this
chapter, and shall warrant the design, material and workmanship of such
improvements, installation and/or construction for a period of three (3)
years from the date of acceptance by the City. Such warrant shall be by a
maintenance bond, shall be subject to review by the City Attorney, shall
specifically assure the expedient repair or replacement of defective
improvements under warranty and shall indemnify the City from any and all
costs or losses resulting from or contributed to such defective improvements.



b.   Plan Review



All plans, specifications, installation and construction required by this
chapter shall be subject to the review, approval and inspection by the City
Engineer or other authorized City representative. The subdivider shall
furnish the City Engineer with a construction schedule prior to commencement
of any and/or all construction and shall notify the City Engineer not less
than twenty- four (24) hours in advance of readiness for required
inspections. The developer shall be responsible for construction staking,
inspection and materials testing and the developer's engineer shall certify
that all public improvements have been completed in conformance with the
approved plans and specifications prior to the City Engineer's review and
recommendation for acceptance.



c.   Streets



All street improvements shall be designed in accordance with City Public
Improvement Design Standards by an engineer.



d.   Stormwater Management



1.    All subdivisions shall have a storm water management system that is
adequate to prevent the undue or unplanned retention of storm water on the
site.  Undue retention does not include:



(a)   Retention through planned facilities.



  (b)   Retention not substantially different from pre-existing 
conditions.



2.    The design of the storm water management system shall be consistent
with general and specific concerns and standards of the Comprehensive Plan
and the drainage control programs of applicable public agencies.  Design
shall be based on environmentally sound site planning and engineering
techniques.



3.    To the maximum degree possible, drainage from subdivisions shall
conform to natural contours of land and not disturb pre-existing drainageways.



4.    Adjacent properties shall not be unduly burdened with surface water
from the subdivision.  Specifically:



(a)   No action shall unreasonably collect and channel storm water onto
lower properties.



(b)   The volume or rate of post development run off shall not exceed the
amount of predevelopment runoff, and is to be managed in a manner consistent
with Iowa statute and existing case law regarding such flows.



5.   Design shall use the best available technology to minimize offsite'
runoff, encourage natural filtration, simulate natural drainage, and minimize
discharge of pollutants. Best available technology may include retention
basins, swales, porous paving, and terracing.



6.    No surface water may be channeled into a sanitary sewer system.



7.    Where possible, a subdivision's drainage system shall coordinate
with that of surrounding properties or streets.



8.    All storm sewers, catch basins, culverts and drainage improvements
shall be designed in accordance with City Public Improvement Design
Standards, by a Professional Engineer.



e.    Erosion Control



1.   With the submission of the final plat, the subdivider shall submit an
erosion control plan, prepared and certified by a licensed Professional
Engineer, for any land disturbing activity. All grading activities must be
carried out consistent with this approved erosion control plan.



2.   Certification by the Linn County Conservation District of the erosion
control plan for land disturbing activities, as defined by Section 161A.64 of
the Code of Iowa, shall be submitted as  required.



f.     Wastewater Management and Sanitary Sewers



1.   All sanitary sewer systems shall be designed, by an engineer, in
accordance with City Public Improvement Design Standards.



2.   All lots in proposed subdivisions shall be served with a public
sanitary sewer main and gravity sewer service connections, unless the City
approves a variance at the preliminary plat stage.



3.   If the developer feels that connection to the existing City Sewer
System presents geographic or geologic barriers which make such connection
unfeasible and wishes to serve the lots with private sewage disposal systems,
he or she shall present an Economic Feasibility Study, and an Environmental
Impact Study prepared by a Professional Engineer, comparing the costs of
constructing the public versus private system. This report shall be submitted
with the preliminary plat and a request for variance from providing a public
sewer connection.



4.   In addition, if the developer proposes to serve the lots with a
private sewer service system, he or she shall show the proposed system for
each lot on the preliminary plat and submit percolation tests for each lot,
taken at the proposed absorption field sites to determine the size of field
required for each lot. The plat and percolation test results shall be
submitted to the Linn County Health Department (LCHD) for review and
approval, which shall be evidenced to the City by a letter from the LCHD,
submitted to the City with the preliminary plat. The City shall consider all
these submittals in reviewing a developer's proposal for private sewage
disposal systems and to determine if public sewer service is feasible or
private systems may be permitted.



5.   The developer's engineer shall furnish the City with three (3)
certified copies of as-built plans showing service line locations and final
sewer and maintenance hole locations, lengths, elevations and grades.



6.   If private sanitary sewer systems are permitted for each lot, they
shall be allowed only with the following provisions:



(a)   All successive lot owners shall agree to connect to the City sewer
system if it is installed to the corner of their lot. The lot owner shall be
required to connect to the City sewer system within two years after
construction of the City system.



(b)   When the lot owner is connected to the City sanitary sewer system,
the existing private sanitary sewer system shall be abandoned in conformance
with all local, County and State standards. Abandonment shall be completed
within six (6) months following connection to the City sanitary sewer system.



g.     Sidewalks



Sidewalks shall be installed in conformance with Chapter 136 of the Code of
Ordinances. Sidewalks shall be installed by the builder prior to issuance of
an occupancy permit.  The Zoning Administrator may require the subdivider to
install temporary sidewalks where uncompleted sidewalks represent a nuisance
or safety concern. The subdivider may provide a temporary sidewalk consisting
of crushed stone. The Subdivision Agreement shall define the sum of money to
be escrowed into a special city fund equal to the cost associated with
special assessment of said amount of sidewalk. This cost is typically 2.5
times the construction cost of the sidewalk. A conditional 30-day occupancy
permit may be issued and may be extended dependent upon weather conditions.
Such request for a conditional occupancy permit shall be presented to and
acted upon by the Building Official.



h.     Electric and Communication Utility Cables



1.   Primary Line - the main source of electricity or communication
service. The primary line shall be underground depending on its location on
the lot. Underground lines may be located at either the front or back lot
lines within the area of perpetual easement.



2.   Secondary Lines - branch lines from the primary line to the user. All
secondary lines must be buried.



3.   Street Lighting - When underground electrical service is provided,
the subdivider shall install street lighting as defined in the Design
Standards.



4.   Communication Cables - The subdivider shall arrange for the
installation of telephone, cable television or other communications cables.



i.   Gas mains



Gas mains shall be installed underground and located to comply  with City
Public Improvement Design Standards.



j.   Water Supply.



1.   Water shall be supplied to all proposed subdivisions by connecting to
the existing City water system unless the developer requests a variance from
the City Council.



2.   The proposed water distribution system for all subdivisions shall
include water mains, fire hydrants and valves designed and constructed in
conformance with City Public Improvement Design Standards.  No variance from
this will be allowed.



3.   The developer shall provide a water service line to each lot, stubbed
to the property line in conformance with City and State Design Standards and
City Water Department procedures and practices.



4.   If a variance is requested to provide a private and/or community
well, the developer shall submit with the preliminary plat an Economic
Feasibility Study Report, and an Environmental Impact Study prepared by an
Engineer, which documents the cost of providing City water service to the
subdivision versus a private and/or community well system for water supply.



5.   If a private and/or community well is proposed by the developer and
approved by the city during the preliminary plat review stage, it shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with regulations of the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources and the Linn County Board of Health who shall
approve its construction prior to the issuance by the City of certificates of
occupancy for any building in the subdivision.



6.   If a private and/or community well system is permitted by the City,
it shall be allowed only with the following provisions:



(a   The private well system and all distribution lines, hydrants, valves
and appurtenances shall remain the property of the developer and/or
Homeowners Association.



(b)   The developer and all successive lot owners shall agree to connect
to the City water system if it is installed to the subdivision.  The lot
owner shall be required to connect to the City sewer system within  two
years after construction of the City system.



(c)   When the subdivision is connected to the City water system, all
existing lot owners shall be required to disconnect from and abandon their
existing private and/or community well in conformance with all local and
State standards, and shall share equally in the cost of same. Abandonment
shall be completed within six (6) months following connection to the City
water system.



(d)   When the subdivision is connected to the City water system, the City
will accept dedication of the existing distribution system, provided it has
been properly certified, maintained and as-built plans have been submitted to
and approved by the City Engineer, pursuant to subsection 9 below.



7.   The developer's engineer shall observe all water system construction
and shall certify that the construction was done in accordance with the plans
and specifications issued for the project.



8.   The developer's engineer shall furnish the City three (3) certified
as-built construction plans showing the final locations of all water mains,
valves, hydrants and service taps, lines and curb stops.



9.   Both the developer's engineer's certificate of completion and
as-built construction plans for the water system shall be furnished to the
City upon completion of public improvements and request for City acceptance,
even when the water system will remain under private ownership. The
certificate and as-built drawings will remain on file with the City for
reference and use when the subdivision is connected to City water and the
City considers accepting dedication of the water distribution system.



166.16    Public Service Areas, Parks, and Open Spaces



All residential developments should be designed so that adequate open spaces
and sites for public uses may be properly located and preserved as the
community develops. In order that the cost of providing parks, playgrounds
and recreational facilities and sites necessary to serve the additional
families brought into the community by the subdivision development may be
most equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional need created by the
individual subdivision development, the following provisions shall apply to
all future residential developments or subdivisions or planned unit
developments greater than one-half (1/2) acre in size within the City.



a.     Public Areas Dedicated



Where it is determined by the City Council that public service areas are
necessary and required, the subdivider or developer shall be required to
dedicate or reserve such an area without cost to the City.



b.     Recreational Areas and Open Space



Within the corporate limits of the City where it is determined by the Council
that open space and recreational areas are necessary and required, and where
feasible and compatible with the Comprehensive Plan of the community, the
subdivider or developer shall provide and dedicate to the public adequate
land to provide for said public service areas, open space and recreational
needs of the subdivision or development. Provided, however, said open space
and recreational facilities may be reserved and held by private persons or
home owners' associations or like entities under a Planned Unit Development
(PUD) if same satisfies the requirements of this chapter. Provided further,
however, should open space and recreational facilities be required of a PUD
in another ordinance, law or statute with minimum areas which are greater
than those provided herein, then said other ordinance, law or statute shall
govern.



1.   Open Space Reserved. Where land or property is to be reserved and
ownership of same retained or held in the name of a private person or
association, same shall be permanently reserved for public use, as directed
by the Council, and held for the purpose of open space and recreational
facilities and its purpose or shall not be altered.



2.   Area Required. The amount of land shall be determined by first
calculating the entire size of the land area of the proposed development as
shown on the preliminary plat or site plan and then requiring dedication or
reservation of five percent (5%) of said land area as hereinafter provided.



3.   Fee in Lieu of Dedication. The Council may, upon the recommendation
of the Commission, determine that the subdivider or developer shall, in lieu
thereof, pay to the City a fee or combination of fee and land equivalent to
the value of the required dedication or reservation.



4.   Use and Location. Such fee shall be used exclusively for immediate or
future site acquisition and development and shall be used only for the
purpose of providing public service areas, open space lands and other
recreational facilities to serve the subdivision or development for which
received. The location of the land shall bear reasonable relationship to the
use of the open space lands and other recreational facilities by future
inhabitants of the subdivision or development for which received as well as
those inhabitants of the community.



5.   Fee Determined. In all cases where the Council, upon recommendation
by the Commission, shall direct and determine that cash is to be deposited,
or that a combination of cash and land is to be deposited, dedicated or
reserved for public service areas, park playground or recreational purposes
or a combination of uses, the fee shall be set at 1% (one percent) of the
sale price of each lot, at the time of sale of said lot. The developer shall,
upon sale of each lot, transfer 1% of the sale price of said lot to the
City's special revenue account.



6.   Fund Established. All funds so levied, assessed, and collected by the
City shall be deposited in a special fund to be known and designated as
"Special Fund for the Acquisition and Development of Public Service Areas,
Open Space and Recreational Facilities" (Special Fund). Said funds so levied
and collected shall be used for such purposes at such places and in such
manner as shall be approved, ordered and directed by the Parks and Recreation
Board, which shall be consistent with this chapter.  Authorization for
creation of said fund is hereby granted. Any and all interest accumulated
upon such funds shall be added to the special fund and be used only for
acquisition and development of open space and recreational facilities.



7.   Procedure. The procedure for determining whether the subdivider or
developer is to dedicate or reserve land, pay a fee, or both, shall be as
follows:



(a)   Subdivider-Developer.  At the time of filing a preliminary plat or
site plan with the Commission, the owner or developer of the property shall,
as a part of such filing, indicate whether he or she desires to dedicate or
reserve property for public service areas, open space and recreational
purposes, or to pay a fee in lieu thereof.



(b)   Cooperation with Parks and Recreation Board. When the preliminary
plat is received by the City, the Clerk shall forward a copy to the Parks and
Recreation Director. The Parks and Recreation Board may review the same and
make recommendations and suggestions thereon with regard to the placement,
size, design, and location of said proposed public service areas, open space
or recreational area, cash in lieu of dedication or reservation of land, or a
combination of both, within the terms and tenor of this chapter.  Any
recommendations shall be made to the Commission within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a copy of said preliminary plat by the Director.  Failure to make
recommendations and suggestions within the thirty (30) days aforementioned
shall in no way serve to delay, postpone, or reject the preliminary plat or
site plan, and the requirement that the Parks and Recreation Board make such
recommendations and suggestions shall thereby be waived.



(c)   Action of City. At the time the preliminary plat or site plan is
approved by the Council, the Council shall determine, as a part of such
approval, whether to require a dedication or reservation of land within the
subdivision or development, payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a
combination of both; provided however, that the City shall determine which
land shall apply to the dedication or reservation and the requirements
contained herein.



8.   Prerequisites for Approval of Final Plat or Site Plan. Where a
dedication is required, it shall be accomplished by providing the City with a
properly executed warranty deed dedicating the required land to the City
without cost to the City. Where fees in lieu of dedication are required,
except for the one percent (1%) park fee (Paragraph 116.16(5)), the same
shall be deposited with the Clerk prior to the approval of the final plat or
site plan.



9.   Determination. The Council shall determine whether dedication,
reservation or cash in lieu thereof or a combination of cash, dedication and
reservation shall be required. In making this decision, the City Council
shall consider the following:



(a)   Recreational element of the City’s Comprehensive Plan.



(b)   Topographic and geologic conditions and access and location of land
in subdivision or development available for dedication.



(c)   Size and shape of the subdivision or development and land available
for dedication.



(d)   The relation of the subdivision or development to the Comprehensive
Plan, particularly as the Comprehensive Plan map may show proposed public
service areas, open space and recreational areas.



(e)   The character and recreational needs of the neighborhood in which
the subdivision or development is located.



(f)   The unsuitability in the subdivision or development for open space
and recreational purposes by reason of location, access, greater cost of
development and maintenance.



(g)   The possibility that land immediately adjoining the subdivision or
development will serve in whole or in part the public service areas, open
space and recreational needs of such subdivision or development.



(h)   Recommendations and suggestions of the Parks and Recreation Board
and the Planning and Zoning Commission.



(i)   Any and all other information relevant to a proper determination.




The determination of the Council as to whether land shall be dedicated or
reserved or a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final
and conclusive.



10.   Development of Dedicated Area. It shall be the duty of the Parks and
Recreation Board of the City to develop properly and to maintain the
dedicated area for open space and recreational facilities. The owner who
dedicated this land shall in no way be responsible for its development,
maintenance, or liability thereon, except that the owner shall not develop
the surrounding area in a manner which would unduly depreciate the purpose,
use or value of the dedicated property. Where the owner is allowed to retain
the land required for open space and recreational purposes and facilities in
private ownership, it shall be the owner's responsibility to properly develop
and maintain such area.



166.17    Improvement Financing and Guarantees



a.   Purpose



The purpose of this Article is to ensure the equitable financing and proper
installation and maintenance of required streets, utilities, and other
improvements.  The guarantee shall be structured to provide adequate
assurances to the City while avoiding unnecessary costs to the developer.



b.   Application



This article applies to subdivisions requiring the installation of streets,
utilities, or other public improvements by the City or developer.



c.   Subdivision Agreement



1.    Condition for Approval of Plat



As a condition for final approval, each subdivision plat must include a
subdivision agreement entered into between the City of Mount Vernon and the
subdivider. Additionally, no contract for the construction of public
improvements involving a subdivision within the extraterritorial jurisdiction
but outside the corporate limits of Mount Vernon shall be awarded without the
approval of such an agreement.



2.    Rules for Distributing Improvement Costs



Generally, the following rules shall be applied in distributing costs for
public improvements:



(a)   Public Costs




The City shall pay for those items that have demonstrable benefit to the
general public. If applicable, these items may include:



(1)   Pavement width in excess of 28 feet for streets designated as
collector or arterial streets in the Comprehensive Plan or the street
planning map. On collector and arterial streets requiring a higher standard
of paving than normal, the additional cost shall be borne by the City or
other public agency.



(2)   The incremental cost of water mains over those required by the
Public Improvement Design Standards.



(3)   Storm sewers or drainage structures in excess of those required by
the Public Improvement Design Standards and required to serve other areas in
the watershed. Such expenses may also be assessed on an area basis to
properties served by the improvement.



(4)   The additional costs of sanitary sewers in excess of those required
by the Public Improvement Design Standards, when such sewers are required by
the City.



(5)   Park and recreation facilities consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan.



(b)   Private Costs



The developer shall pay for those items that have direct benefit primarily to
the property being subdivided.  If applicable, these items shall include:



(1)   The entire cost of grading street rights-of-way, including
intersections.



(2)   All sanitary sewer lines within the subdivision and water lines
within the subdivision.



(3)   All paving and street construction, including curbs and gutters and
street lighting, up to a pavement width of 28 feet.



(4)   A stormwater management system adequate to provide for the
collection, retention, and removal of surface runoff, extending to the
boundaries of the subdivision.



(5)   Sidewalks as required by this Ordinance.



(6)   The contract charge for underground electrical and gas service.



(7)   An iron rod not less than one-half inch in diameter and 24 inches in
length as follows:



(aa) Set at the intersection of all lines forming angles in the boundary of
the subdivision and at all street intersections.



(bb) At lot corners and changes in direction of block and lot boundaries.



(c)   Negotiated Costs



In the event that there are costs associated with a particular subdivision
that are not public or private costs as set out in subparagraphs (a) and (b),
the developer and the City will enter into an agreement, which shall be
included as part of the subdivision agreement, as to the developer's and the
City's respective responsibilities for these costs, based on the estimated
private benefit to the developer and the estimated public benefit to the
City.  Further, in certain subdivisions, it may be in the public interest to
pay for some or all of the private costs associated with the upgrade of water
and sewer lines outside the subdivision. In the event the City determines to
pay for such costs, the developer and the City will enter into an agreement,
which shall be included as part of the subdivision agreement, as to the
developer's, City's, and any third party's respective responsibilities for
these costs, based on the estimated private benefit to the developer the
estimated public benefit to the City, and the estimated private benefit to
any third party.  Negotiated costs are:



(1)   Costs to the improvements outside the subdivision and necessitated
by the subdivision.



(2)   Other costs not included in subparagraphs A and B of this section.



d.   Performance and Financial Guarantees



1.    As a condition of the final approval of the plat and prior to its
recording with the Linn County Recorder, the City Council shall require and
accept the following:



(a)    The furnishing of a performance bond, letter of credit, cash
escrow, or other guarantee in a form acceptable to the City, in an amount not
to exceed 110% of the estimated cost of the improvement installation.



(b)   A specification of the time allowed for the installation of
improvements.  This period may be extended by the City Council.



(c)   The performance guarantee amount and requirement, along with the
permitted time for installation, shall be included within the Subdivision
Agreement negotiated between the City and the Developer and approved with the
Final Plat.



2.   If private costs are incurred by the City due to the subdivision, the
subdivider shall guarantee repayment of those costs, should increased tax
revenues from the subdivision not cover those costs within seven (7) years of
the date of the approval of the final plat. The terms and conditions of this
agreement shall be spelled out in the Subdividers Ageement under the heading:
"Written Assessment Agreement to Establish Minimum Taxable Value".



e.   Notification of Completion and Acceptance by City



1.    Notification



Upon substantial completion of all required improvements, the developer shall

Before a preliminary or final plat may be considered by the Commission, there
must be certification by the Clerk that such filing fees as may have been
established by resolution of the Council for such plats have been paid by the
subdivider or agent.



b.     Variations and Exceptions



Whenever the tract proposed to be subdivided is of such unusual topography,
size or shape, or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions
that the strict application of the requirements contained in these
regulations would result in substantial hardships or injustices, the Council
upon recommendation of the Commission may vary or modify such requirements so
that the subdivider is allowed to develop the property in a reasonable
manner; but so, at the same time, the public welfare and interest of the City
and surrounding area are protected and the general intent and spirit of these
regulations are preserved.



c.   Enforcement



1.   No plat of any subdivision shall be recorded in the County Recorder's
Office or have any validity until it has been approved in the manner
prescribed herein. The Council shall not permit any public improvements over
which it has control to be made from City funds or any City money expended
for improvements or maintenance on any street in any area that has been
subdivided after the date of adoption of these regulations unless such
subdivision or street has been approved in accordance with the provisions
contained herein and accepted by the Council as a public street. (Code of
Iowa, Section 354.6)



2.   The Zoning Administrator shall enforce the provisions of this
ordinance and shall bring violations or lack of compliance to the attention
of the Planning and Zoning Commission, City Council, or other appropriate
agencies.



d.   Changes and Amendments



Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the Council; provided, however, that such changes and amendments
shall not become effective until after study and report by the Commission and
until after a public hearing has been held, public notice of which shall be
given in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten (10) days prior to
such hearing.



APPENDIX TO CODE OF ORDINANCES:



USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES



The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper
maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.



DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES



   1.   OFFICIAL COPY.  The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of
Ordinances must be kept by the City Clerk and should be identified as the
“OFFICIAL COPY.” 



   2.   DISTRIBUTION.  Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should
be made available to all persons having a relatively frequent and continuing
need to have access to ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as
reference centers such as the City Library, County Law Library and perhaps
the schools.



   3.   SALE.  The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion
is not recommended as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution
tends to result in outdated codes being used or misused. 



   4.   RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION.  The City Clerk should be responsible
for maintaining an accurate and current record of persons having a copy of
the Code of Ordinances.  Each official, elected or appointed, should return
to the City, upon leaving office, all documents, records and other materials
pertaining to the office, including this Code of Ordinances.   



(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])



NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES



It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed.  For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances was No. 163, we would suggest that
the first ordinance passed changing, adding to or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164; the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and
so on.  We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for
the numbering of ordinances.



RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES



Please note that two books should be maintained:  (1) the Code of
Ordinances, and (2) an ordinance book.  We will assist in the maintenance of
the Code of Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and
returning appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to
accommodate ordinances amending the Code.  The City Clerk is responsible for
maintaining the ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each
ordinance adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted
in the ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.



SUPPLEMENT RECORD



A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided
in the front of the Code.  This record will indicate the number and date of
the ordinance adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code.  For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance.  A
periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure
that all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.



DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS



Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent
to the Clerk.  It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person
having a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be
properly updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.



AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES



The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date
of its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts. 
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
