1.9 FLOODPLAIN ZONING DEFINITIONS
The following definitions are intended to assist in understanding the sections of this ordinance dealing with
flood
plain zoning.
Channel
: A perceptible watercourse, with a definite bed and banks which confine and conduct the normal flowof water. Channel flow pertains to that water which is flowing within the limits of the defined channel.
Flood
: A temporary rise in stream flow that results in water overtopping its banks and inundating areas that areadjacent to the channel.
Flood Plain
or
Flood Hazard Area
: The channel and the land adjacent thereto which has been, or may behereafter, covered by flood water; including, but not limited to, the regulatory flood.
General Flood Plain District (GFP)
: Primarily includes the area defined as the Flood Plain or Flood HazardArea; and, with proper hydrologic studies, may be further subdivided into a floodway and flood fringe as definedin the following:
Floodway
- The channel of a stream and those portions of the flood plain adjoining the channel that arerequired to carry and discharge the flood water within designated heights and velocities; including, but notlimited to, flood flows associated with the regulatory flood. The floodway is intended to carry the deep and fastmoving flood water, and the two principal factors in its determination are the selection of the flood dischargeand the permitted increase in flood heights.
Flood Fringe
- The portion of the flood plain beyond the limits of the floodway. Flood waters in this area usuallyare shallow and slow moving. A wider range of development (filling, buildings, and other structures) is permittedin this area, provided that it is protected from the waters of the regulatory flood level. This development, ofcourse, tends to reduce flood water storage capability and somewhat increases flood height, but theseundesirable effects must be weighed against the economic losses to landowners and the community ifdevelopment is completely prohibited.
Flood Discharge
- Is the quantity of water flowing down a stream valley as a result of runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. The volume of water passing any point along a stream usually is measured incubic feet per second, (c.f.s.), gallons per minute (g.p.m.), or million gallons per day (m.g.d.). One c.f.s. equals694 g.p.m.
9/15/22, 10:25 PM Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/wilmore-ky/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-5 8/71
Flood Frequency:
Floods along a single stream are commonly compared in terms of their frequency ofoccurrence. For example, a flood may be referred to as a 50-year frequency flood, which means that it has aprobability of occurring once every fifty years, or two percent probability of occurring in any one given year. Thisflood, of course, may actually occur only once in a 50-year period or it may happen more or less frequently.Although flood discharge increases as the return period lengthens, the discharge of a 100-year flood is notsimply twice that of a 50-year flood. This is dependent upon the hydrologic characteristics of the watercourse.
Flood Profile
: A graph of longitudinal profile showing the height of the flood discharge measured at pointsalong the watercourse, generally in feet above mean sea level. The profile elevations are used to determine theexact limits of the flood plain in the field, to solve mapping disputes, to specify flood-proofing levels forconstruction, and to determine the degree of non-conformity of existing structures. There is a different floodprofile for every size of flood discharge. Even identical flood discharges, occurring at different time periods onthe same watercourse, can result in different flood profiles because of physical changes within the watershed,such as vegetation growth or reduction, addition of new structures, etc.
Flood Proofing
: A combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structuressubject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages to properties, water and sanitaryfacilities, structures, and contents of buildings in a flood-hazard area.
Obstruction
: Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channelrectification, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure or matter in, along,across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory flood-hazard area which may impede, retard,or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by suchwater, or that is placed where the flow of water might carry the same downstream to the damage of life orproperty.
Reach
: A means of dividing the length of a stream into sections, with the word "Reach" denoting a longitudinalstream segment, with the beginning and ending points of each reach often being a tributary branch, bridges,culverts, or other characteristics.
Regulatory Flood
: For purposes of this ordinance, the regulatory flood shall be a flood of a 100-yearfrequency, and the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be one (1) foot above the water surface elevationsof the regulatory flood. The 100-year flood frequency shall be the basis for determining the regulatory flooddischarge, flood profile, flood protection elevation, floodway and flood fringe.

3.28 FP FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICT
3.281 FINDINGS OF FACT
Findings of fact are made as follows:
A.
Losses resulting from periodic flooding: The
flood
hazard areas of Kentucky are subject to periodicinundation, resulting in damage to, or loss of, life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption ofcommerce and governmental services, public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment ofthe tax base. All of these adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare.
B.
General causes of periodic flooding: The general cause of the periodic flooding, and resulting losses, are:
1.
The cumulative effect of
obstructions
within flood hazard areas which intensify flood height and velocity;
2.
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by users vulnerable to flood damage, or by uses hazardous to otherlands which are inadequately elevated or otherwise properly protected from flood damages;
3.
Increased storm water runoff from upstream areas as a result of natural ground cover being replaced bybuildings, streets, parking
lots
, etc.
C.
Flood Hazard Delineation: The method used for reasonably analyzing and delineating the flood hazard areais described in Section 3.274.
3.282 PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES
The delineation of the
flood
hazard areas, and the
regulations
applied thereto, are intended to:
9/15/22, 10:25 PM Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/wilmore-ky/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-5 29/71
A.
Promote the public welfare by protecting human life and health, and minimizing public and private propertydamage.
B.
Provide for public awareness of the flooding potential, and protect individuals from buying land and
structures
which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
C.
Minimize pollution of surface and ground water which could affect human, animal and plant life.
D.
Control development which, acting alone or in combination with similar development, will create an unjustifieddemand for public investment in flood control improvements because uses vulnerable to floods, including
public facilities
, were not protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; will create anadditional burden to pay the costs of any relief measures such as rescue, pumping, dikes, storm sewers, etc.;and will create an additional burden to the public in terms of business interruptions, street closings, utilityservice disruptions, and other happenings which result in loss of safety, wages, sales, production, andgovernment revenue.
E.
Maintain a stable tax base by protecting flood prone areas from unwise development.
3.283 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
The following shall apply to the official zoning map:
A.
Coverage: The lands to which this ordinance applies, and the establishment of
regulatory flood
protectionelevations, shall be as follows:
1.
Land Coverage: This ordinance shall apply to all the land within the jurisdiction of the City of Wilmore,which is shown on the Official Zoning Map as being located within the boundaries of the
general flood plaindistrict
.
2.
The regulatory flood protection elevation and
subdivision
of the general flood plain district into more precise
flood
control areas shall be as provided within later sections of this ordinance.
B.
Establishment of Official Zoning Map: The Official Zoning Map, together with all explanatory matter thereonand attached hereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance.
C.
Interpreting
District
Boundaries: The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scalingdistances, with the
Board
of Adjustment making any necessary interpretation, after the Board has provided areasonable opportunity for presentation of material by any person contesting the boundary location.
D.
Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is consideredreasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Largerfloods may occur on rare occasions or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. Thisordinance does not imply that areas outside the flood-plain districts or land uses permitted within suchdistricts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of theCity of Wilmore or any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that result from reliance on thisordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
3.284 METHOD OF DELINEATING FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
This ordinance uses a two-step process for reasonably analyzing the
flood
hazard areas, and delineating thenecessary
district
boundaries, as described in the following:
A.
General Flood Plain District
: The first step is taken by delineating the "general flood plain district" boundarieson the official zoning map. The district boundaries encompass land determined to be subject to floodingbased upon evidence of past floods. The information used as evidence of past flooding include soil surveymapping by the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, United States GeologicalSurvey maps, photographs, and personal interviews of City of Wilmore residents.
B.
Subdividing General District: The second step depends on securing more refined hydrologic data in order tosubdivide the general flood plain district into a
floodway
district and a
flood fringe
district. Until such time asthe hydrologic data is secured by governmental action, persons requesting special permit uses shall submitdata at their expense for a case by case evaluation by the
Board
of Adjustment, with expert technicalassistance, where necessary. Where applicable, the Board shall:

1.
Estimate
Regulatory Flood
Discharge: Estimate the discharge of the regulatory flood which isrepresentative of large floods known to have occurred in the City of Wilmore area, and which arereasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to thisordinance. The regulatory flood shall be in the general order of a flood which could be expected to occur onthe average of once every one hundred (100) years.
2.
Determine Specific Flood Threat: Determine the specific flooding threat at the site of the proposed special-permit
use
, and determine whether the use is located in a flood fringe area by:
a.
Elevations - Calculation of water surface elevations and flood protection elevations based upon ahydraulic analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatoryflood. Flood protection elevations shall be one (1) foot above the water surface elevations of theregulatory flood.
b.
Floodway - Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights toan extent which would cause substantial upstream or downstream damage to existing or reasonablyanticipated future development. Computation of increases in flood heights caused by any encroachmentshall be based upon the reasonable assumption that there will be an equal degree of encroachment onboth sides of the stream within that
reach
. Generally, any increase in flood stages attributable toencroachments on the flood plain of any river or stream shall not exceed 0.5 feet in any one reach or forthe cumulative effect of several reaches.
3.
Evaluate: Evaluate the effects of the proposed use upon the public health, safety, and general welfare inlight of the purposes of this ordinance and the standards established herein and deny, grant, orconditionally grant the application for the proposed use.

use
of the land in a manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the samezone. The Board may impose any reasonable conditions or restrictions on any
variance
it decides to grant.

8.8 GRADING PERMIT
8.1 FINDINGS OF FACT
The following findings of fact related to the causes of
soil
erosion
are made:
a.
Significant erosion results from rainfall and runoff over unprotected soil. Erosion is increased by intenserainfalls, long
slopes
, steep slopes, and lack of adequate vegetative cover. These conditions are in partcaused by or aggravated by improper construction,
grading
, or
excavation
which results in removal of naturalground cover without taking appropriate steps to control erosion problems.
8.2 PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES
The intent of this ordinance is to:
a.
Reduce
soil
erosion
in Jessamine County.
b.
Provide procedures for submission, review and approval of erosion control plans to be submitted prior to soildisturbance.
8.3 SCOPE OF COVERAGE
The following are included within the scope of this ordinance.
a.
Erosion
Control Plans are required in the following circumstances:
All persons submitting to the Jessamine County - City of Wilmore Joint Planning Commission MajorS
ubdivision
P
lats
or D
evelopment Plans
must include a note on the Preliminary Plat or Development Planstating that no
grading
, excavating,
stripping
, filling or other disturbance of the natural ground cover shall takeplace prior to approval of an Erosion Control Plan. An Erosion Control Plan shall be submitted after aPreliminary Plat or Development Plan has been approved. Any persons disturbing the natural ground coverin an area for which there is an approved Erosion Control Plan shall conform to the requirements of suchPlan without exception.
b.
Grading Permits are required in the following circumstances:
All persons doing any grading, stripping, excavating, filling or otherwise disturbing the natural ground cover inan area for which no erosion control plan has been approved, must obtain a Grading Permit prior tocommencing such work, unless exempted under Section 6.3(d). For any work or developments not requiringa fully developed Erosion Control Plan, a grading plan addressing at a minimum the handling of topsoil andoff-site runoff during grading must be submitted in conjunction with the Grading Permit application.

d.
Has no final
slopes
steeper than one (1) foot vertical in three (3) feet horizontal;
e.
Has proper vegetative cover re-established as soon as possible on all disturbed areas; and
f.
Has no fill placed on a surface having a slope steeper than five (5) feet horizontal to one (1) footvertical.
3.
Accepted agricultural land management practices such a plowing, cultivation, construction of agriculturalstructures, ponds, waterways, nursery operations such as the removal and/or transplanting of cultivatedsod, shrubs, and trees, tree cuttings at or above existing ground level, and logging operations leaving thestump, ground cover and root mat intact. Non-agricultural uses permitted in the A-1 zone are not exceptedfrom the requirements of

The Administrative Officer may extend the deadlines contained in the Plan or Permitrespectively upon a showing by the applicant: a) that there is sufficient justification for the delay; b) thatdelay will not create a new erosion hazard or permit an existing one to continue; and c) that a newcompletion date has been set.
B.
Contents of the
Soil
Erosion Plan
For purposes of obtaining a Grading Permit or for coordination with a Major Subdivision Plan or DevelopmentPlan, an Erosion Control Plan containing the following information must be submitted, unless suchinformation is available to the Administrative Officer in an acceptable form. This information must be suppliedfor the entire tract of land whether or not the property will be developed in stages. If the development occursin stages the Erosion Control Plan shall be approved as a whole; however, after construction has begun onthe initial stage the Administrative Officer or the Enforcement Officer must inspect the site prior to grantingapproval for the issuance of
building permits
for any other stage of construction.
1.
The Erosion Control Plan shall be drawn at a scale of 1" = 100' (or less) indicating
a.
the site location as well as the adjacent properties, and
b.
identification of any
structure
or natural feature on the land adjacent to the site and within 250' which hasa significant impact on drainage or siltation controls.
2.
Property boundary bearings and distances for the site on which the work is to be performed.
3.
A soil survey or a description of the main soil types (available from the Jessamine County SoilConservation
District
).
4.
The anticipated time of exposure of each area prior to the completion of effective erosion and
sediment
control measures.
5.
Existing topography at contour intervals not exceeding five (5) feet.
6.
Proposed topography at contour intervals not exceeding five (5) feet.
7.
Elevation, dimension, location, extent and the
slope
of all proposed grading.
8.
Location and identification of all site features (either man-made or natural) which have a significant impacton drainage or siltation controls.
9.
Plans and specifications for all drainage provisions, retaining walls, cribbing, planting, anti-erosion devicesor other protective devices (whether temporary or permanent) to be constructed in connection with, or as apart of the proposed work, together with a map showing the drainage area of land tributary to the site and astatement explaining the amount of estimated runoff used to determine the design characteristics of anydrainage device. Upstream drainage must be considered and explained if any adverse effect is possible.
10.
Plans for removal, re-contouring or other final disposition of sediment basins or other structuralimprovements or devices included in the plan.
11.
If a sedimentation basin is required, it should be designed by a registered engineer.

online.encodeplus.com/regs/wilmore-ky/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-5 68/71
C.
Factors Which Shall be Considered in Reviewing Applications for Erosion Control Plans and/or GradingPermits
1.
The development should relate to the specific site conditions.
2.
The plan should keep land grading and land disturbance to a minimum under the circumstances.
3.
Both surface and storm water drainage systems should be integrated to accommodate the increased runoffincurred during land grading.
4.
To prevent soil erosion, existing temporary and future protective vegetative cover should be emphasized.
5.
The plan shall coordinate grading operation and sediment control measures so as to minimize landexposure to erosion.
6.
Sediment basins below high sediment producing areas should be planned, installed and maintained assafety devices to catch and trap excessive sediment from the development site.
7.
The plan should utilize available technology to keep soil erosion to a minimum level.
8.
Retaining walls shall be planned, installed and maintained where slope is steeper than one (1) foot verticalin two (2) foot horizontal on excavated slopes,
cuts
or
fills
greater than four (4) foot vertical.
9.
Fill areas shall be engineered to be appropriate for intended
use
. Plan should include method forplacement of large material such as concrete slabs or rock boulders with dimension greater than two (2)feet in any direction. Method of placement should be designed to prevent voids in fill which may causeshifting, sliding or settling of material.
8.5 FAILURE TO COMPLETE WORK OR COMPLY WITH TERMS OF PLAN
In the event of failure to complete the work or failure to comply with all the requirements, conditions and termsof the Permit or Plan, the Administrative Officer or Enforcement Officer may order stoppage of work. The JointPlanning Commission may instruct the Administrative Officer to refuse to issue any additional
building permits
and/or it may order work authorized by Plan or Permit to be completed.
8.6 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES
a.
Violations
Whenever, by the provisions of this Ordinance, the performance of any act is required, or the performance ofany act is prohibited, a failure to comply with such provisions shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance.
