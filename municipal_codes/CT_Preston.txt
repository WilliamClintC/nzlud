Section 7-153 of the Connecticut General Statutes.
A sewage disposal facility permit shall be in effect for one year from the
date of issue. When work on the sewage disposal facility is not
completed within one year of the date of the permit issue, the permit
may be renewed, if there has been no significant change in the sewage
generating potential of the premises or a significant change in other
conditions that could effect the operation of the sewage disposal facility.
3.3 Expansion of Existing Premises or Dwelling. For any premise
which is not connected to a public sewage system no construction or
alternation of use, which will significantly increase sewage flow through
. expanded occupancy potential for a dwelling or adjusted use for nondwelling
structures, shall be permitted without the prior approval of the
Health Officer concerning the site's sewage disposal potential.

period and my be renewed at the discretion of the Health Officer for
additional thirty-day periods, as circumstances may warrant.
SECTION 4: PROCEDURE FOR EVALUATING FEASIBILITY OF
SUBSURFACE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM.
4.1 Individual Lots. In evaluating the feasibility for a subsurface
sewage disposal system on an individual lot, the Health Officer shall
take into consideration the following factors:
'J
4.1.1 Absorptive Characteristics. The soil absorptive characteristics
shall be determined by performance of one or more percolation tests in
the anticipated area of the sewage disposal facility. The percolation
tests shall be performed according to the standard practice required by
the State Public Health Code. Such tests shall be performed by the
Health Officer or by an engineer approved by the Health Officer. When .·)
the Health Officer is directed to run such tests, the owner shall dig all
test holes, if necessary supply any materials and equipment for the
administration of such tests, and shall compensate the Town in
accordance with Section 6.3 When such tests are performed by an
engineer, the Health Officer shall be notified in advance of the time the
tests are taken. At his discretion the Health Officer will be present
when the tests are taken.
4.1.2 Subterranean Characteristics. The subterranean characteristics
of the tract shall be documented by deep soil soundings, exploratory
cuts, visual observation of the terrain and appropriate reference to any
available documented data. Depending. upon the" extent of the proposed
development more detailed information may be required under this
section. For instance, a large commercial, industrial or multi-family
development would require substantial in-depth investigation that
would not be required for a single-family home. All such investigations
shall be completed at no cost to the Town and shall be performed only
as the need is indicated. At the discretion of the Health Officer, such
investigations shall be done in his presence, or the results therefrom
made available for his inspection.
-73-
)
,)
4.1.3 Decision. The health Officer shall render judgment on·applications for site
approval not later than six weeks after the submission thereof, provided that the
applicant cooperates in the digging of the percolation test holes and any other
required investigations. Except that the Health Officer may delay a decision under
the following guidelines:
(a) Minimum seepage rate should be one inch in 30 minutes or faster.
(b) Bottom of seepage trenches or leaching cesspools must be at least 18
inches above maximum groundwater level. If shallow three feet trenches are used,
maximum groundwater level must be at least 4.5 feet below surface.
4.2.1 General. An application for subdivision approval must submit a Health
Officer's Report to the Planning and Zoning Commission as part of a subdivision
application. The applicant shall cooperate with the Health Officer in the
preparation of this report. The applicant shall also submit a report from an
engineer, who is approved by the Health Officer and the Commission. This report
shall describe the plans for sewage disposal facilities in the proposed subdivision,
and be in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2.3
4.2.2 Health Officer's Report. For a proposed subdivision the Health Officer shall
be required to submit to the Planning and Zoning Officer a report evaluating the
. feasibility for subsurface sewage disposal systems. Before the Health Officer can
undertake a report, the subdivision applicant must provide two (2) copies of the ,
proposed subdivision which shows the lots and general topography of the area. The
Health Officer's Report shall show the results of the following investigations;
4.2.2.1 Absorptive Characteristics
The Absorptive characteristics of the soil, as determined by the performance of one
percolation· test per lot or per acre in the subdivision, whichever is less. The
percolation tests shall be performed according to the standard practice required by
the State Public Health Code.
The percolation tests must be performed by the Health Officer or an engineer
approved by the Health Officer and the Commission, according to the provision of
Subsection 4.1.1
-74-
4.2.2.2 Subterranean Characteristics.
The subterranean characteristics of the soil shall be determined by the ' J
performance of deep soil pits. at the rate of one for each acre in the
proposed subdivision, except that the requirements may be reduced
where other investigation indicates well-drained soils are present.
Deep soil pits shall be dug a minimum of seven feet below the gr'ound
surface. The results shall be indicated on a test pit log as shown in
Appendix A. The applicant shall arrange for the digging of all
necessary deep soil pits and shall compensate the Town for each soil
appraisal performed by the Health Officer.
4.2.2.3 Other Considerations.
In preparing the report to the Commission, the Health Officer shall
take into consideration other factors that could effect the feasibility of a
subsurface sewage disposal system. These factors should include
topography, drainage pattern, groundwater level, ledge, rock etc.
4.2.3 Engineer's Report. The subdivision application, for a subdivision
that will be served by on-site sewage disposal system, shall include an
engineer's report on the feasibility for on-site sewage systems and the
plans for the system. The report shall discuss the following points;
4.2.3.1 Analysis of the subsurface soil conditions based upon required
subsurface investigation. Include the results of percolation tests and
deep soil pits, if performed by the applicant's engineer.
4.2.3.2 Describe the proposed sewage disposal facilities, indicating sizes
for various ground conditions, materials to be used and general layout
pattern to be used, etc.
4.2.3.3 Indicate special precautions that maybe necessary to provide
proper function of the proposed sewage disposal system.
4.2.4 Decision. The Health Officer's ,Report shall.be, submitted to the
Planning and Zoning Commission not later than six weeks from the
date of application, provided that the applicant cooperates in the
digging of percolation tests holes, deep soil pits and other required
investigations. The Health officer may delay submission of his report
under the guidelines specified under Subsection 4.1.3.
. ·.)
4.2.4.1 Disapproval of Subdivision. When a proposed subdivision is
served by neither a public sewerage system or a public water supply ,
the Health Officer may, after appropriate consultation with the J
-75-
Connecticut State Department of Health, decline to' approve the
proposed subdivision or resubdivision, if in his judgment , such a
) concentration of private on-site sewage disposal and private water
" supply facilities may result in bacteriological or chemical pollution of
said water supplies.
)
)
4.2.5 Review Final Plan. The Health Officer shall examine the final
subdivision plan to determine that the field data on which judgments
were based have not been altered in any way whicn could materially
affect the sewage disposal potential of any lot in the subdivision.
4.2.5 Subdivision Information used in Evaluating a Lot. Although a lot
is within a subdivision which has been generally approved as suitable
for development, said lot will be considered individually in light of the
specific soil conditions and proposed use, at the. time the owner seeds
permission to erect a structure or structures thereon. · However, any
available data which was developed in the process of evaluating a
proposed subdivision may be used in the evaluation of a specific lot, if
such data is, in the Health Officer's judgment, valid and applicable.
4.2.7 Exceptions for Existing Structures. In instances involving ·
premises existing on the effective date of this ordinance, where for
reasons of limitations of property, or for other valid pre-existing
circumstances, it is impossible to require compliance with the standards
of this ordinance regarding the size of the sewage disposal facility or
minimum separating distance requirements (Section 5.1), the Health
Officer may permit lesser standards thari allowed in this ordinance, but
no standard shall be less than established in the State Public Health
Code.
SECTION 5: LOCATION, INSTALLATION AND DESIGN OF
SEW AGE DISPOSAL F AGILITY
5.1 LOCATION. No part of any sewage disposal facility shall be
located within 75 feet of the high water mark of any tributary to a
drinking water supply or any other stream, pond, lake or tidal water.
5.2 INSTALLATION. All sewage disposal facilities shall be installed,
with reference to design and layout, in accordance with the terms of the
permit issued pursuant to this ordinance.
5.2.1 No Sewage disposal facility shall be installed such that the
bottom of the absorption or leaching porting of the system is less than
eighteen (18) inches above the maximum groundwater table and/or four
( 4) feet above any underlying impervious substratum.
-76-
5.2.2 Leaching systems shall not be located in fill placed over
impervious soil. When filling is allowable and necessary to render a
tract usable for on-site subsurface sewage disposal, the Health Officer
may require that any or all of the following measures be implemented:
the stripping and removal of loam, muck or other similar organic
matter from the area immediately beneath the proposed absorption ..
system area; the leveling and effective loosening of the sub-soil in the
stripped area, the filling of the requisite area to an appropriate
elevation with clean absorptive material; and the provision of suitable
perimeter embankments around the filled system area to prevent the
lateral escape of sewage through the walls of the embankment created
by the filling.
5.3 DESIGN The sewage disposal facility for dwelling shall be
designed according to the standards and specifications of the State
Public Health Code. For other types of premises sewage disposal
facilities shall be designed in accOrdance with the specifications

This will follow up your question regarding the ordinance
concerning public bidding. The ordinance requires that all
contracts in exGess of $3,500.00 be awarded only after public
notice and bid, other than for expenditures made from town aid
funds. It is my opinion that public notice and bid requires more .)
than calling vendors and getting quotes for the goods or services
in question. Public notice and bid require publication of the
contract requirements in a newspaper and receipt of closed bids
from the interested vendors. The ordinance does not require
awarding of the contract to the lowest bidder and the Town has
the discretion to award any contract to other than the highest
bidder if it determines in its discretion that it would be in the
best interests of the Town to do so.
If you have any other questions regarding this matter, please
let me know.

A coastal site plan application pursuant to Section 17  Coastal Area Management of the Regulations is required for activities located within the coastal boundary.
b. Stormwater: Landscaping and stormwater drainage associated with site development shall be of a design and layout to minimize potential water quality impacts of non-point source runoff, including hydrocarbons, fertilizers and pesticide applications. Stormwater drainage shall be designed to relate harmoniously with the adjacent landscape and structures. All drainage design shall be developed in accordance with the State of Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual, latest edition.
c. Conservation/Public Access Easements: The Commission may require deeded conservation easements to the Town or any other 501(c)(3) recognized conservation entity approved by the Commission to protect coastal and natural resources and to allow public access to coastal or other natural resources and/or historic resources, where appropriate and available. The Commission shall make this determination during the coastal site plan review process and/or the site plan review process, whichever may be applicable.
11.5 Design Standards: These design standards are provided to ensure harmonious creative design that allows flexibility to achieve the overall goal of a well-planned and well-designed New England style development. All applications for development within the TRD shall be submitted with a general plan illustrating how the project coordinates, complements and fits with the overall plans for the comprehensive development of the TRD.
a. Multiple Buildings and Uses: A lot may be occupied by more than one (1) permitted principal building or use. The separating distance between individual buildings shall be adequate to complement the natural and man-made features of the site and surrounding area. Separating distance between buildings may be used for pedestrian or vehicle access or be landscaped. The Commission for vehicular and pedestrian safety and compatibility with site features shall review building separation distances. At no time shall any building
37
separation distance conflict with any federal, state or local building or fire code requirement.
b. Special Features: Important existing site features, such as stonewalls, large trees, and other features shall be preserved and incorporated into the new design to the maximum extent feasible.
c. Building Design: All structures and projects should be consistent with the Thames River Design Guidelines, hereinafter referred to as the Design Guidelines (which are an addendum to these Regulations).
d. Lot Coverage and Building Height: Structures shall not cover more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the property. The Commission shall consider impacts on vistas and solar access when reviewing the height of structures within the District and may establish height limitations based on such impacts as vistas and solar access.
e. Sign Design: The design, proportion and placement of signs shall complement the buildings composition and architectural details. The design shall consist of materials, colors, and lettering styles and sizes that relate to the architectural styles in this District. Additional sign requirements are stipulated in Section 21 of these Regulations. Any site plan submitted to the Commission for approval of development within the TRD shall include a signage plan delineating the location of all proposed signage, the size, shape, lighting and conceptual design of all proposed signage within the property that is the subject of the site plan application.
f. Parking: Off-street parking shall meet the requirements of Section 20, unless otherwise specified in Section 11.5 (m) of the Regulations. All parking areas shall be attractively landscaped with planting strips between bays and planting strips separating driveways from parking bays. No parking shall be located in front of the building served by such parking area, but may be located to the side and rear of the building.
g. Buffers: A landscaped buffer strip shall be provided to adequately screen all abutting residentially zoned properties and/or cemeteries. Such buffer shall provide a physical separation that screens any vehicular head light glare, on-site lighting glare, or other visual intrusion into the adjacent residential zone or cemetery. The Commission may forward copies of the plans to the cemetery association(s) for review and comment. The Commission may also require a buffer strip to provide visual separation from other redevelopment areas within the District where the incorporation of such buffer strip adds to the overall aesthetic character of the District. Off-street parking is prohibited within these areas.
h. Noise: No development or project shall produce decibel levels that exceed the State of Connecticut recommended noise levels.
i. Lighting: The site plan shall show all proposed exterior lighting in enough detail for the Commission to assess the impact of the lighting on the surrounding area. In no case shall
38
the lighting be located such that its height, direction, intensity or conditions pose a nuisance to surrounding uses. The Commission may require a lighting plan prepared by a licensed professional engineer to determine compliance with this requirement.
j. Dimensional Requirements: Other than those separating distances required to comply with other code requirements (building, fire, etc.) there shall be no minimum dimensional requirements within the TRD. Side and rear building set back lines, distances from the centerline of the roads, and building height shall be subject to approval by the Commission. In exercising its discretion, the Commission shall only approve setback lines, the height of structures, and distances that are designed to create a well-planned community thereby allowing the sharing of resources, parking and utilities. In considering building height, the Commission shall consider safety, impact on vistas and on the potential use of solar energy.
k. Energy Efficiency and Sustainability: In formulating each site plan for development in the TRD, consideration shall be given to create a development that minimizes the impact on ecosystems and water resources, promotes smarter use of water to reduce both potable and non-potable water consumption, promotes better building energy performance through innovative strategies, encourages the use of sustainable building materials and reduces waste, promotes improved indoor air quality and access to daylight and views, promotes walkable neighborhoods with efficient transportation options and open space, emphasizes compact, walkable, vibrant, mixed-use neighborhoods with connectivity to nearby communities, and/or reduces the environmental consequences of the construction and operation of buildings and infrastructure.
l. Access and Traffic: All development within the District shall comply with the following standards, as applicable:
1. In order to reduce possible point of traffic conflict, the Commission may require access drives to be located along a side property line so that with the development of the adjacent property, the access drive could be widened onto that adjacent property, to create "one" access drive to serve two (2) or more properties. The Commission may also require common interior drives to serve more than one (1) parcel, where appropriate for traffic safety and when connecting to a public road/street. The Commission may require the incorporation into any site plan of reserved rights-of-ways together with an obligation to construct in locations in which the Commission deems interparcel access to adjacent public streets reasonably necessary to enhance traffic flow and to prevent congestion and traffic conflict on existing municipal and state streets and highways. Where common access drives are approved by the Commission as a component of a site plan approval, a written agreement for the common use and maintenance of shared access facilities, subject to the approval of the Preston Town Attorney (not to be unreasonably withheld), shall be executed and recorded in the Preston Land Records prior to the issuance of zoning permit for the approved development.
2. The Commission shall require minimum sight line distances depending on present and anticipated traffic conditions and current engineering design standards.
39
3. Since it is the intent of the Regulations to create a walkable community, the applicant must demonstrate that the site design makes proper provision for pedestrian access and safety problems.
4. Any permit application may be denied by the Commission if, after review and evaluation, no reasonable modification can be made to ensure that the proposed use will not create or further aggravate vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic safety problems.
5. The applicant is responsible for obtaining all other required access and traffic permits from the ConnDOT or Office of State Traffic Administration or other, as required by applicable regulations. The status of such permit activity shall be included with any application for development within the TRD. In the event that any such permit or authorization is granted subsequent to the date that the Commission issues its site plan approval, which permit requires material modifications to the proposed street layout, intersection design or traffic controls incorporated into the site plan approval, the applicant shall submit such amendments and modifications to the Commission for approval and the Commission shall evaluate such modifications and amendments in an application for modification of site plan approval applying the parameters set forth in these Regulations.
m) Off-Street and Off-Site Parking: The amount of off-street parking for buildings and uses in the TRD shall either (i) be as stipulated in Section 20 of these Regulations for each of the permitted uses or (ii) be based upon an evaluation of the parking needs for the applicable uses delineated on the site plan or Master Plan, as applicable, prepared by a professional engineer with experience in parking and traffic circulation design, whose recommendations may be adopted by the Commission and incorporated into the Master Plan or site plan approval.
In addition, proposed development activities may provide for off-street parking to be located off-site under the conditions 1) thru 4) below:
1. The off-site parking shall be easily accessible and located within a practical distance from and appropriately located to serve the principle building as illustrated by the applicant and determined to be acceptable by the Commission. The Commission shall also determine that the location of the proposed off-site parking facility will not hamper current or future development opportunities or represent a public safety concern.
2. An agreement, providing for the use and maintenance of such parking facilities, shall be submitted with the application, and subsequent to approval, executed by the applicant and filed in the Preston Land Records.
3. A separate lot used for off-site parking for a developed parcel shall not be included in calculations when determining compliance with any dimensional requirements of the principal developed parcel, including lot coverage for the parcel on which the principal use is located. An off-site parking garage shall meet lot coverage restrictions for the
40
parcel on which it is located. For uses requiring a significant number of parking spaces, several smaller interconnected parking areas separated by landscaped islands are encouraged rather than a single large parking lot for aesthetic and drainage purposes.
4. Alternating work shifts can be considered when calculating the parking, as deemed acceptable by the Commission.
o) View Shed Protection: The Commission may consider the impact of the development on the view shed of the Thames River.
11.6 Non-Conforming Buildings/Residential Density Limitations: Any single-family residence existing at the time of the Effective Date of Section 11 of these Regulations and located within the TRD shall be exempt from Section 22.2.3 of these Regulations which prohibits the expansion of non-conforming buildings. In addition, such existing single-family residences shall not be taken into consideration in the determination of the maximum residential density in the TRD or any TRODD.
11.7 Thames River Overlay Development District (TRODD): The purpose of this floating overlay district is to encourage and permit variety and flexibility in land use that will augment creative design development within the TRD. This Section 11.7 sets forth the procedures and criteria for the Commission to rezone one or more portions of the TRD to TRODD, in conjunction with the approval of a master plan for redevelopment; and eventually to approve a site plan for one or more segments of a TRODD as they are proposed for development and construction. Section 11.7 is organized into five subsections: Section 11.7.1  Permitted Uses Within TRODD; Section 11.7.2 - Procedures For Rezoning To TRODD; Section 11.7.3  Criteria And Standards for Rezoning to TRODD; Section 11.7.4  Site Plan Approval Requirements for TRODD; and Section 11.7.5 - Modifications. The TRODD allows the Commission to approve a project with uses that are in addition to those permitted as of right in the TRD and to allow the use of specific development and use related criteria and requirements in lieu of the development and use criteria and requirements set forth in Section 3.14.3, Sections 11.1 through 11.6 and Sections 15, 16, (excluding Section 16.15), 18, 19, 20, 21 and elsewhere in these Regulations, which shall not apply to the TRODD. In exercising its legislative discretion in considering an application for an TRODD, the Commission shall consider the recommendations contained in the Preston Plan of Conservation and Development, Preston Riverwalk Plan of Conservation and Development and the Design Guidelines. In furtherance, once a parcel is established as a TRODD, the criteria and requirements set forth in the master plan approved by the Commission will become the zoning requirements for that specific parcel.

1. A pre-application review shall be allowed, but is not required, to provide the applicant with the opportunity to discuss with the Commission the conceptual plan for the project without extensive details. Any pre-application shall be submitted to the Commission for consideration a minimum of two (2) weeks prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission. Upon receipt, if the property that is the subject of the pre-application is not covered by a PDDA, the pre-application shall be referred to the PRA for review and recommendation. The PRA shall provide a report to the Commission within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. The report submitted by the PRA shall address the economic benefits or detriments, as the case may be, of the proposed TRODD to the community and region, including job creation.
2. The pre-application review and the informal consideration of the conceptual plan shall not be deemed to constitute any portion of the official and formal procedure of applying for a change of zone or a Master Plan approval. In the event that an applicant utilizes the pre-application review process, neither the applicant nor the Commission shall be in any way bound by statements made in such informal discussions, their purpose being only to minimize delay, expense and inconvenience to the public, the applicant and the Commission upon the future receipt of a formal application for a zone change to TRODD and Master Plan approval. Since the pre-application review is an informal, non-binding process, the applicants submission shall be of such content and detail as will enable the Commission to provide comments on areas of concern or interest to the applicant. The level of detail of information submitted by an applicant for a pre-application review shall be at the applicants discretion. However, the more complete information and plans submitted for discussion will result in more meaningful feedback from the Commission.
3. Formal Application: Any owner of property located within the TRD may apply to the Commission for a change of zoning district classification from the TRD to the TRODD. The applicant need not own all land within the proposed TRODD, and failure to own all land within such proposed district shall not prevent the Commission from hearing or granting any such application; provided, however, that the owner of each parcel delineated on the Master Plan for which TRODD approval is requested consents in writing to the filing of the application for the TRODD. The application shall be submitted to the Commission on a form prescribed by it and accompanied by all applicable application fees for a zone change in accordance with the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Preston. The Commission shall have the right to retain third party consultants as deemed necessary by the Commission for the review of the technical aspects of the zone change and Master Plan application, which may include, but are not limited to: engineering, legal, planning, historic, archaeological, architectural, landscape, environmental. The applicant shall be responsible for paying the reasonable costs of such third party consulting services. In connection therewith, the Commission shall obtain a not-to-exceed fee estimate for the cost of the consulting services for such third party consultant(s). The Commission shall advise the applicant of said fee in writing. If the applicant disagrees with fee estimate, the
44
applicant may negotiate with the Commission and the third party consultant regarding the estimate or the applicant may propose an alternate consultant that is acceptable to both the applicant and the Commission. Upon conclusion of said negotiations and selection process, the applicant shall deposit with the Town the total amount of said consultant fees. The actually incurred fees of the consultant, up to the not-to-exceed amount, shall be paid to the consultant by the Town after receipt from the consultant of itemized bills for the same, which shall be subject to the reasonable review of the applicant. The Commission shall use the consultant fees deposited with the Town solely for expenses associated with the technical review of the application and for no other purposes. Consultant fees shall be charged only by consultants who are not otherwise salaried employees of the Commission or the Town. All remaining fees after the completion of the project shall be returned to the applicant. The foregoing consulting fee process shall be in lieu of that set forth in Section 3.17.2(b).

SECTION 12 VILLAGE DISTRICTS
12.1 Intent. It is the intent of these Regulations to preserve the unique village areas, enhance their sense of place, and promote a thriving attractive environment for small scale businesses that are appropriate for the village areas. Development of these villages with mixed residential and limited business uses with detailed design review will add an incentive for investments in measures to protect the historic qualities of the village including its historic buildings.
The Regulations have been enacted pursuant to Section 8-2j of the CGS to allow for creative and complementary development techniques. As an addendum to these regulations, the Commission has prepared separate guidelines that will include property ratings for each village property (this prioritizes a property for its significance archictecturally and physically), and general design techniques for the specific village. These guidelines are to reflect the unique character of the specific village (for example, Preston City Village Design Guidelines will reflect the design techniques that complement the character of Preston City Village), and shall be used to aid the intent of the regulations and the specific objective for the specific village.
For the purpose of this section, a historic building is as listed on the National Register of Historic Places Registration Form as a contributing building for either the Preston City Village Historic District or the Poquetanuck Village Historic District.
12.2 Village Districts (listed)
a) Preston City Village District. Preston City, part of which is a National Register Historic District, is an exceptionally well preserved entity containing a high concentration of contributing historic buildings and sites dating from the late seventeenth to the twentieth centuries. This truly authentic New England village has a distinct character that reflects the rural atmosphere of the Town. Historically, Preston City has functioned as an agricultural, social and business center. The district is located within the watershed area for Amos Lake, a prominent and significant natural and recreational resource. In order to protect this significant resource and its watershed, development within this district is subject to Section 13 of these Regulations.
b) Poquetanuck Village District. Poquetanuck Village is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Similar to Preston City, Poquetanuck Village has traditionally housed a mixture of land uses at a higher density. The village, settled in the 17th century, was the site of early settlement with coastal trading, lumber production, iron making, and shipbuilding, as the major industries. The village generally encompasses a winding portion of Route 2A that extends from the bridge over Halls Brook to the intersection with Route 117 with 2 intersecting roads, Brickyard Road and Cider Mill Road. The village is bordered by the sensitive natural and archaeological resources of Poquetanuck Cove. In order to protect the significant Cove resources and its watershed, development within this district is subject to Section 13 of these Regulations.
12.2.1 Objective: Preston City Village and Poquetanuck Village from their inception to the present, contain both residential and non-residential uses.
53
They are recognized as special places and assets of the Town as evidenced by its inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places as Historic Districts. For these reasons, Preston City Village District and Poquetanuck Village District were created.
The objective is to improve upon the village character by creating more cohesive and defined villages that reflect the small town rural atmosphere, complements the Preston City and Poquetanuck Village National Register Historic Districts, promotes social and economic vitality, and enhances sense of community and place thereby resulting in an improved quality of life for the residents and taxpayers of the Town of Preston.
Promoting development of Preston City and Poquetanuck Village with mixed uses is part of the approach to meet this objective. How property is used within the districts will depend upon the specific characteristics of the property as noted in the Property Rating Description. Business uses shall be developed when such development adds to the overall village character. It is not the intent to allow business development as of right, nor is it the intent to create conventional or strip commercial development. Business development is permitted when a conversion or new construction is developed in a manner that visually meets the intent and objectives of these Regulations. In addition, it is critical that new construction for single-family homes also comply with the criteria as outlined in the Regulations. The design guidelines, property rating description and the review of a Historic Architect or other experts on historic architecture are to be used as tools to aid in the visual layout and aesthetic improvements to existing and new structures and other physical improvements to the property.
12. 3 Review of applications: The Commission shall review all proposed applications, including zoning permits with the exception of permits for:
a) Single family home
b) Additions to single family residences and accessory buildings provided the changes do not change the single family character of the structure.
c) Farming, not including commercial nurseries or accessory farm businesses.
12.3.1 Service of a Historic Architect/Expert. The Commission may hire a historic architect or an expert on historic architecture to assist in the review of applications, for the following:
a) All applications for permitted uses, unless the use is listed as an exception as noted above in Section 12.3 a),b), and c).
b) Special permitted uses as noted in Section 12.3.4.
c) The expertise of the historic architect/expert shall be made available to the applicant for the review of any permit that is exempt from these Regulations.
12.3.2 Commission considerations: The Commission shall consider the design guidelines, property rating and comments from the historic architect/expert in addition to the review criteria or special exception criteria in the review of each application.
12.3.3 Permitted uses:
a) All uses permitted in Section 5.1 of these Regulations.
12.3.4 Special Exception uses:
54
The following list of uses permitted by special exception allows for a variety of complementary uses that strengthen village neighborhoods, aesthetically, culturally, economically and socially.

12.3.5 Special Exception criteria: The design standards and property ratings shall be established for each specific village. The Commission, in their review of all special exception applications, shall consider these standards and other pertinent factors such as the type and style of exterior windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, above ground utility structures, mechanical appurtenances, type and texture of building materials, and hours of operation. All applications shall be subject to the requirements of Section 19 site plan review, the general criteria established in Section 18 for special exception applications and the following:
a) New buildings shall be comprised of one and one-half or two stories, or externally appear to be such, however the Commission may allow a portion of the structure to be single story if it is consistent with the historic and architectural character of the area. Such architectural styles shall be consistent with that of the National Register Historic District.
b) Renovations to historic buildings (all historic buildings are identified on a district map and property rating) should be consistent with spirit and intent of the Secretary of Interior Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, as amended.
55
c) Proposed buildings or modifications to existing buildings shall be in keeping with their surroundings, the terrain and to the use, scale and architecture of the existing buildings in the vicinity that have a functional or visual relationship to a proposed building or modification.
d) All spaces and structures shall be designed to add to the visual amenities of the area consistent with those of the village district in and around the proposed building or modification.
e) The color, size, height, proportions of openings, roof treatments, building materials and landscaping of property and any proposed signs and lighting shall be compatible with the local architectural motif and the maintenance of views, historic buildings, monuments and landscaping.
f) Removal or disruption of historically significant structures or architectural elements or distinguishing landscape features such as specimen trees and stone walls shall be minimized.
g) Arrangement and orientation of any proposed building or site improvement shall be similar to that of the immediate neighborhood including the front yard setback.
h) Layout and construction of buildings and parking lots shall reinforce existing buildings and streetscape patterns, and the placement of buildings and parking lots shall create no adverse impact on the immediate neighborhood. Parking lots shall be located so that they are not closer to the road than the front of the structure. In all situations, the parking lot shall be screened from the road using a variety of low growing shrubs as well as street trees. The plantings shall not interfere with sight line for the driveways. In areas where a parking lot abuts a property used for residential purposes or is zoned residentially, there shall be a landscape buffer strip with staggered evergreen trees and shrubs adequate to create a solid screen preventing view of such parking lot from the residential property.
i) The lot coverage shall include all parking, whether pervious or impervious, and all other impervious surfaces. The total lot coverage shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of the lot area.
j) Parking to serve the development shall not be located on the street. The Commission may waive the number of parking spaces required for a development in accordance with Section 20 of the Zoning Regulations, if the applicant can prove that the total number of spaces is unnecessary based on professional publications from the American Planning Association or other similar professional organizations. The applicant shall, show on the plan submitted, an area reserved for the parking that would meet the regulations. If the installation of the additional parking is required at a later date, the Commission may require the applicant to install such spaces. The Commission will determine whether the additional spaces are necessary based on violations to this section, which may include the use of on-street parking.
k) Open space and green space of the proposed development shall reinforce open/green space patterns of the immediate neighborhood in form and siting.
l) Locally significant features of the site, such as distinctive buildings or vistas, shall be integrated into the site design.
m) Landscape design shall complement the neighborhoods landscape patterns and reinforce functional qualities.
n) Exterior signs, lighting and accessory structures shall support a uniform architectural theme and present a harmonious relationship with the surrounding neighborhood. Signage shall be designed to be consistent with the design guidelines for the specific district. Lighting provided must be non-glare (so not to glare onto any residential adjacent property).
o) The scale, proportions, massing, and detailing of the proposed building shall be in proportion to the scale, massing and detailing in the neighborhood, but in no case shall a building exceed three thousand five hundred (3,500) square feet. Conversion of existing structures in excess of
56
three thousand five hundred (3,500) square feet may be permitted if the building existed at the site as of the date of these Regulations March 18, 2019; however, if an addition is proposed to an existing building, the cumulative square footage of the building shall not exceed three thousand five hundred (3,500) square feet. The Commission may, by two-thirds vote, permit development of new buildings or existing buildings and their additions in excess of three thousand five hundred (3,500) square feet provided that the scale of the structure is in keeping with the neighborhood. This may be accomplished by incorporating eels or wings in the building design to minimize massing of the main portion of the structure.
p) Ramps shall be harmonious to the design of existing structures.
q) Minimum lot requirements: Lot size shall be sixty thousand (60,000) square feet; frontage shall be one hundred fifty feet (150); however, the Commission may reduce this to one hundred twenty five feet (125) in the event driveway access for a commercial development is shared with an abutting property and provided that proof of proper legal easements for use and maintenance is provided to the Commission.
r) All applicants shall demonstrate that they have considered the use of green or pervious parking lots for parking lots that exceed five parking spaces. Such lots shall be designed using current technical standards as developed by the University of Connecticut.
s) Protection of Natural Resources: It is a goal of the Commission to minimize off-site runoff from parking lots, roads, driveways, and sidewalks, so that water is allowed to infiltrate rather than runoff. All plans shall incorporate methods that help accomplish this goal. Examples of methods include developing landscaped islands for stormwater management and installing porous parking lots. Applicants shall implement Best Management Practices for the design of the project. Development shall be consistent with Section 13 Special Resource Protection Overlay District: Amos Lake Watershed Area and Poquetanuck Cove Watershed Area. The developer shall:
1. Show the location of the development within the watershed.
2. Minimize the disturbance of natural grades and vegetation.
3. Protect natural wetland and stream buffers.
4. Maximize infiltration of stormwater.
5. Minimize impervious surfaces.
t) All such development shall be designed in accordance with the Preston City Village and Poquetanuck Village Design Criteria and property rating system.
u) Public hours of operations for commercial establishments shall be between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
v) Temporary real estate signs shall not exceed three feet (3) by three feet (3) in size.
12.3.5 Prohibited uses within the district:
a) Installation of temporary garage or storage structures.
12. 3.6 Variance: When a variance is sought from the Zoning Board of Appeals for any property located in this district, the Zoning Board of Appeals must refer the application to the Commission for review. The Commission must provide a report to the Board on this matter within thirty (30) days. If a report is not provided within that time period, it will be assumed the Commission has no concern with the matter.

Section 14  AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
14.1 Purpose and Intent. There is a need to provide an alternative and creative method to diversify housing opportunities within the Town of Preston in order to encourage affordable housing opportunities within the municipality with the goal of achieving the affordable housing threshold of ten percent (10%) of the total housing units in the Town of Preston. The Planning and Zoning Commission desires to encourage affordable housing with the Town of Preston in a manner that will achieve the following objectives:
a) to allow, on a long term basis, for the development of diverse housing types, including affordable housing to help address identified housing needs within the Town of Preston,
b) to encourage the construction of housing that is both affordable as defined by Connecticut General Statute Section 8-30g et. Seq. and is consistent with design and construction standards present in the community;
c) to promote housing choice, including, affordable housing for low and moderate income households;
d) to efficiently utilize infrastructure and promote neighborhood planning by providing, where infrastructure support is available, a mix of housing types, densities, sizes and prices while also providing public and private open space and recreational areas;
e) to guide development complying with the criteria established in this regulation in a manner consistent with the statutory purpose of protecting the public health, safety, convenience and property values; and
f) to encourage energy-efficient patterns of development, the use of solar and other renewable forms of energy, and energy conservation. It is therefore the intent of this regulation to create, within the Town of Preston, Affordable Housing Development Districts (AHD).
The AHD will be a Floating Zone governed by a Master Plan prepared in accordance with these Regulations. The Master Plan will be subject to review and approval by the Commission as a zone change, subject to a public hearing and all other applicable terms and conditions of these
60
Regulations. It is recognized that the Master Plan may require fluidity in order to accommodate market changes that may dictate the need for changes in the design of the affordable housing project during the course of completion of development of the project. In the event that there is any substantial and material change proposed for the Master Plan as determined by the Commission, the change will be subject to the same procedural requirements for a zone change as required by the original zone change application adopting the AHD. Once enacted, the AHD will supersede all pre-existing zoning, and any development on the zoned property will be subject to the specific AHD requirements set forth herein.
14.2 Applicability: An Affordable Housing District (AHD) may be permitted in any residential district within the Town of Preston, and must contain a minimum of ten (10) developable acres (see Section 2 for definition). A waiver from the minimum developable acreage requirement may be granted by the Commission if the project meets the purpose of Section 1 Purpose and Intent as noted above, but in no case shall the total acres of the parcel be less than ten (10) acres. The applicant shall comply with all other provisions of these Regulations and the Subdivision Regulations of the Town of Preston. Applications to create affordable housing districts under Section 14 of these Regulations may only be filed with the Commission during periods of time in which less than ten percent (10%) of the aggregate housing units in the Town of Preston fail to qualify as affordable housing units pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 126a of the CGS.
14.2.1 Primary Uses and Structures permitted.
a) Single-family detached dwellings (on either common interest ownership property or subdivided lots, or as rental units).
b) Multi-family (condominium, rental, common ownership property).

16.15 Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) Requirements. The Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) includes all areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its
78
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for New London County, Connecticut, dated July 18, 2011, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), dated July 18, 2011, and other supporting data applicable to the Town of Preston, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation, it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA. The area of special flood hazard includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A and AE, including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM. Areas of special flood hazard are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location.
The degree of flood protection required by this regulation is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration and research. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This regulation does not imply or guarantee that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Area or uses permitted in such areas will be free from flooding and flood damages. This regulation shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Preston or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this regulation or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. The Town of Preston, its officers and employees shall assume no liability for another persons reliance on any maps, data or information provided by the Town of Preston.
The following requirements are intended to reduce the threat to public safety and loss of property value resulting from periodic flooding and to ensure eligibility for continued participation by the Town of Preston in the National Flood Insurance Program. In cases where conflicts occur between the requirements of the underlying zoning district and these SFHA requirements, the more restrictive provision shall prevail. The following regulations apply within the SFHA.
16.15.1 All applications for zoning permits or special exceptions for new development shall include base flood elevation data for that portion of the development located within the SFHA on the Towns FIRM. The Commission shall utilize flood elevation data on the FIRM, or, where this is not available, the Commission shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other sources as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in the SFHA, meet the standards of these Regulations. Where base flood elevations are available, but before a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one foot (1) at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development. In the event that floodway data from sources other than the FIRM are utilized, the Commission shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot (1) at any point. (12/15/91)
79
Within the SFHA for all applications of areas designated A or AE shall address the following, as applicable:
a) Equal Conveyance. With the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00) feet increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
b) Compensatory Storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas that are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality.
c) Above-ground Storage Tanks. Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.
d) Portion of Structure in Flood Zone. If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure.

SECTION 1: TITLE, PURPOSE, AND AUTHORITY
1.1. Title. This document contains regulations covering the subdivision of land in the Town of Preston, Connecticut, which shall be known as the Subdivision Regulations, Town of Preston, Connecticut, and which are referred to herein as these Regulations.
1.2 Purpose. The purpose of these Regulations is to promote and to ensure the orderly development of land within the Town so that the land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health and safety; so that proper provisions shall be made for water supply, surface drainage, and sewage disposal; so that proposed streets shall be in harmony with existing or officially proposed major Town roads and so arranged and constructed so as to provide an adequate and convenient system for the present and prospective traffic needs; so that open spaces for parks and playgrounds shall be provided in locations deemed proper by the Commission; and, in general, to protect the health, safety, convenience and welfare of the inhabitants of the Town of Preston.
1.3 Application of Regulations and Authority. These Regulations shall apply to any owner or agent of the owner of any land within the Town of Preston who subsequent to the effective date of these Regulations proposes to effect a subdivision or resubdivision of land, as herein defined. These Regulations are adopted by the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Preston pursuant to the authority conferred by Chapter 126, Connecticut General Statutes.
SECTION 2: DEFINATIONS
This section defines a number of important words and terms used in these Regulations. Any term defined in the Preston Zoning Regulations and used in these Regulations shall have the same definition. The singular number shall include the plural and the plural the singular. Undefined words shall have commonly accepted meanings.
2.1 Subdivision. The division of a tract or parcel of land into three (3) or more parts or lots made subsequent to the adoption of subdivision regulations by the Commission, for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building development, expressly excluding development for municipal, conservation or agricultural purposes, and includes resubdivision.
2.2 Resubdivision. A change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision, or resubdivision, if such change (a) affects any street layout shown on such map, or (b)
Town of Preston, Connecticut
Subdivision Regulations
Revised to August 28, 2012; Effective September 22, 2012
2
affects any area reserved thereon for public use, or (c) diminishes the size of any lot shown thereon and creates an additional building lot, if any of the lots shown thereon have been conveyed after the approval or recording of such map.
2.3 Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Preston, Connecticut.
2.4 Applicant. The owner(s) of the land to be subdivided or an agent, who acts for the owner, provided written evidence of such fact is submitted to the Commission.
2.5 Street. (Rev. 11/14/00; Eff. 12/07/00) (Rev. 05/06/03; Eff. 05/23/03)
i. Any improved right-of-way dedicated for public use, accepted for public use by Town Meeting, and maintained by the Town of Preston for automobile travel; or,
ii. Any proposed street shown on the subdivision plan under consideration; or on one previously approved by the Commission; or,
iii. State of Connecticut Routes 2, 2A, 12, 117, 164, 165 and 605 (Old Shetucket Turnpike).
Streets are further classified when proposed in part of a subdivision as one of the five categories  Light residential, Residential, Collector, Commercial/Industrial, and Expandable, and have the following functions:
a. Light residential streets. These streets are relatively short, service less than thirty (30) home sites, and are dead end cul-de-sacs.
b. Residential streets. These streets generally have more activity than light residential streets, and have between thirty (30) homes and one hundred fifty (150) home sites.
c. Collector streets. These streets receive all of the traffic from the residential neighborhoods and convey it to the major street system (State of Connecticut highway system).
d. Commercial/Industrial (or arterial) streets. These streets have or can accommodate heavy commercial and industrial traffic and are designed to handle the weight and size of commercial or industrial vehicles.
e. Expandable subdivision streets. The expandable street is not an actual classification of street but a situation, which arises often as subdivisions are developed throughout the State. If the probability exists that a dead end street will be opened to future development, then it should be designed to accommodate the future traffic. For example, if a light residential street has twenty (20) homes but another one hundred (100) units are planned in future phases or the potential exists for future development; then the street falls under the residential street classification.
2.6 Cul-de-sac. A residential street that terminates in a circular turn-around.

Such property line adjustment is not considered a subdivision or resubdivision, and, therefore does not require approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission, but does require approval by the Zoning Enforcement Officer to determine compliance with the Zoning Regulations. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall require review by the Town Sanitarian, and if the adjustment changes a parcel to be unbuildable based on the State of Connecticut Public Health Code, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall deny the proposed adjustment.

SECTION 4: OPTIONAL PRE-APPLICATION SKETCH PLAN
4.1 Purpose. The pre-application sketch plan is a general layout of a proposed subdivision submitted by the subdivided for informal consideration by the Commission prior to a formal submission of an application for approval. A pre-application sketch plan shall not be required prior to submission of an application, but applicants are encouraged to use it as a means of ensuring that basic requirements can be met prior to incurring engineering, application, and legal fees involved with submission of the required application and plan. It should be clearly understood that pre-application sketch plan enjoys no official legal status and that consent with regard to feasibility of the pre-application sketch plan on the part of the Commission in no way predicates approval of the required plan. A pre-application sketch plan is encouraged in the interest of improved communication between the applicant and the Commission with regard to intent and general design, but it is at the sole discretion of the applicant.
4.2 Contents. The pre-application sketch plan may be drawn on tracing paper with pencil at a suitable scale, which will show sufficient information about the subdivision to present a clear picture of its scope and impact. The pre-application sketch plan should show:
4.2.1 The subdivision name, boundaries, true north point, date, scale.
4.2.2 The names and addresses of the record of owner and the applicant.
4.2.3 Approximate locations of all major site features such as existing streams, waterbodies, stonewalls, large trees, rock ridges, outcroppings.
4.2.4 The name and approximate location of existing adjacent streets and proposed streets.
4.2.5 The total site area, the total number of proposed lots, and general configuration of the proposed lot boundary lines and approximate area of each proposed lot.

SECTION 6: SUBDIVISION DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
6.1 Lots. Proposed lots shall be arranged to make the best use of the natural terrain, to preserve important natural features, and to afford maximum opportunity for the use of solar energy.
6.1.1 Lot sizes shall conform to the requirements of the Preston Zoning Regulations. Except for special-purpose parcels, such as open space, no parcel shall be approved unless it meets the requirements of the Zoning Regulations.
6.1.2 All lots shall front on a street and have the street frontage prescribed by the Preston Zoning Regulations.
6.1.3 Where practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to the street on which the lot fronts, or radial to curved street lines.
6.1.4 To the maximum extent possible, lots shall be generally rectangular in shape and excessively deep lots shall be avoided.
6.1.5 To the maximum extent possible, lots should be arranged in a manner that provides the best opportunity for the use of solar energy in buildings subsequently built on them. As a general rule, lot arrangements should enable principal buildings to be situated so that their longest axis lies in an east/west direction, so as to expose the front or rear of the building to the south. Attention should be given to ensuring that expected building locations are not shaded by buildings on adjoining properties, particularly on north-facing slopes during the heating season when the sun is low in the southern sky.
6.2 Rear Lots. The Commission may permit the subdivision of land that would result in a building lot or lots being established that are remote from established streets or streets proposed by the subdivision plan, provided that the Commission determines that the establishment of such rear lot or lots and related driveways will not prevent the orderly development of land located between the rear lot and the street, and provided that the following other conditions are met.
6.2.1 It is the intent of this subsection to permit limited use of backland which would otherwise become unusable as land along the street frontage is subdivided. (01/16/87)
6.2.2 Rear lots are permitted only to the rear of lots fronting on streets and not behind other rear lots which front on the same street. (04/18/95)
6.2.3 Any such lot shall contain at least three (3) acres and shall be of such shape that it can contain a rectangle with minimum dimensions of three hundred feet (300) by four hundred feet (400).
Town of Preston, Connecticut
Subdivision Regulations
Revised to August 28, 2012; Effective September 22, 2012
19
6.2.4 Such a lot shall be accessible to a street by way of a driveway owned as part of the lot and consisting of a strip of land not less than twenty-five feet (25) in width throughout. The area of the driveway shall not be included in the three-acre lot size requirement.
6.2.5 The Commission shall determine that the location of the driveway will not impede future development or use of the land through which it passes and will have the least possible harmful impact on the natural features.
6.2.6 The deed for any such lot shall contain the provision that the access driveway cannot be used for access to any other property except for agricultural purposes and that the Town of Preston shall not ever be required to plow, maintain, assume ownership of, or provide school bus service or garbage collection service along the driveway access to such lot.
6.2.7 Where the driveway for any rear lots meets the street, it shall not be closer than one hundred feet (100) from more than one (1) other existing or approved driveway on the same side of the street. The plan for any subdivision having one (1) or more real lots shall show the locations of any existing or approved driveways within one hundred feet (100) in all directions of the proposed driveway or driveways. Connection of any such driveway to a town road shall be approved by the First Selectman. Connection to a state highway shall be approved by the Connecticut Department of Transportation.
6.3 Streets. (Rev. 11/14/00; Eff. 12/07/00) streets shall be laid out so as to provide the connections with existing streets on adjoining properties and also with proposed streets that may be provided for in the Preston Plan of Conservation and Development. When a subdivision adjoins undeveloped land, its streets shall be laid out so as to provide suitable future street connections with the adjoining land where it appears probable that the latter could be subdivided. Streets intended for future extension to adjoining property shall extend to the property line.
6.3.1 Street Design. (Rev. 11/14/00; Eff. 12/07/00)
a) Roadway design criteria. The roadway design shall depend upon its classification. Roadway classifications are as follows: Light residential streets, Residential streets, Collector streets, Commercial and Industrial streets.

*The above noted chart outlines design criteria unless otherwise noted in the Subdivision Regulations.
b) Minimum right-of-way on existing streets. Where a abuts on an existing street which as less than the minimum right-of-way established above, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate to the town for street purposes, a strip of land abutting the existing street of a width equal to one-half (½) of the width required to widen the street to the required minimum right-of-way established above.
c) Slope rights. The Commission may require slope rights and/or rights to occupy property to construct and/or maintain retaining walls or other similar structures.
d) Unimproved town roadway. The Commission may require the applicant to improve to subdivision standards on any unimproved town owned or private roadway if any proposed lot is located on said unimproved roadway.
e) Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall not, exceed one thousand two hundred feet (1,200) in length from its intersection with the nearest through street t the end of cul-de-sac and shall be designed in accordance with the recommended cul-de-sac layout contained herein. Such streets shall be provided as the closed end with a turn-around having a paved travel path of a radius of not less than fifty feet (50) and a street right-of-way of a radius of not less than sixty feet (60).
f) Temporary dead-end. Any temporary dead-end street will be accepted only when a right-of-way is provided to continue the street beyond the turn-around. On a temporary turn-around, it shall be loamed and seeded as shown on the recommended cul-de-sac layout contained herein. Any temporary cul-de-sac shall be constructed in the same manner as a permanent cul-de-sac. If a subdivision is to contain a temporary dead-end street, the subdivider shall post a cash or surety bond for each such street sufficient to cover the cost of removing all pavement no longer essential and extending curbing and gutters from their
Town of Preston, Connecticut
Subdivision Regulations
Revised to August 28, 2012; Effective September 22, 2012
21
point of termination at the beginning of the turn-around at a future date. The disturbed area shall be loamed and seeded and driveways shall be extended and paved as necessary. The Commission may waive the maximum length of dead-end street to exceed one thousand two hundred feet (1,200) in cases where another dead-end or cul-de-sac street could logically connect to provide a future through street. The Commission may request a report from the Director of Public Works and the Fire Chief regarding the request for the increase in the dead-end street length.
g) Street grades. The streets shall be designed so as to have a reasonable relationship to the existing topography. Excessive cuts and fills shall be avoided by good design. Grades of all streets shall not be less than one percent (1%) nor greater than ten percent (10%) except that a maximum grade of twelve percent (12%) may be permitted on light residential streets for distances of not more than two hundred fifty feet (250). Due allowance will not be made for reasonable vertical curves as provided in Section 6.3.1 j) below. The maximum slope for a cul-de-sac shall be five percent (5%).
h) Street and lot layout. Streets shall be so laid as to obtain as many of the building sites as possible at or above grade of the street. In residential areas, curvilinear street arrangements following natural contours where practicable shall be generally used in preference to gridiron systems. To the maximum extent possible, streets shall be laid out in a generally east/west direction to facilitate solar orientation of building on abutting lots.
i) Street access. All streets in any subdivision shall have free access to one (1) or more accepted town streets, or state highways.
j) Vertical curves. Appropriate vertical curves for transition shall be established on all streets and at street intersections to insure adequate sight distances. Vertical curves should be based on a design speed of thirty (30) miles per hour. Where any street approaches an intersection at a grade of five percent (5%) or more, a transition area, having a maximum grade of two percent (2%), shall be constructed for a minimum of fifty feet (50) measured from the right-of-way line of the street so intersected. The Commission may waive this requirement for streets with excessive ledge conditions and after consideration of a recommendation by the Town Engineer.

conditions and any other issues such as location of utility lines and shall be subject to approval by the Commission.
6.5 Drainage. An adequate system of storm water drainage shall be provided and installed by the subdivider and no natural watercourse shall be altered or obstructed in such a way as to reduce the natural runoff capacity unless substitute means of runoff are provided. The developer shall provide additional capacity in adjacent culverts and other drainage features for accommodating increased runoff from the proposed development should it be deemed necessary by the Commission. All existing and proposed drainage systems shall be indicated as to size and location on plans and profile sheets. Drainage rights-of-way through lots shall be a least twenty feet (20) wide, and follow property lines wherever possible. The Commission may require culverts and other storm water drainage installations where it deems necessary, to connect with one (1) or more natural watercourse(s). All necessary easements for drainage shall be provided to endorsement of the approved plan by the Commission Chairman.
a) Design. All storm drainage facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with pertinent specifications of the Department of Public Works, the Connecticut Highway Department and these Regulations. Drainage shall be designed for a minimum of a twenty-five (25) year storm; however, the Commission may require that drainage be designed for greater storm frequency if there are conditions that could create life-threatening situations.
b) Pipe size. All storm sewer pipe sizes are to be determined by actual design with due consideration to the avoidance of problems which may arise from the concentration of storm water runoff or onto adjacent development or underdeveloped properties in the drainage area whether on-site or off-site. The minimum size of storm drains shall be twelve inches (12) and shall have a minimum cover of two feet (2).
c) Slope. The minimum slope for storm sewers shall be sufficient to give a mean velocity of three feet (3) per second when pipe is flowing half full. The maximum slope for storm sewers shall be designed to give a mean velocity of not exceeding fifteen feet (15) per second when pipe is flowing half full.
d) Catch basins. Catch basins shall be constructed at all changes of pipe sizes. Unless otherwise authorized by the town engineer, no gutter shall run for more than three hundred and fifty feet (350) without provision from removal of water by a curb-inlet catch basin, lead-off or other approved method. On slopes of less than five percent (5%), closer spacing of catch basins may be required. At low points, double grate catch basins will be required with four-foot (4) sumps. A gutter flow analysis shall be prepared based on the DOT guidelines.
e) Underdrains. Where excessive ground water or watercourses or wetlands are encountered in the roadway, the Commission may require that suitable underdrains be installed and connected to the nearest drainage facility for that portion of land involved in the subdivision.

h) Existing streets. Where a subdivision abuts on existing town street, or where the tract of land to be subdivided presently receives storm water drainage from an existing town street or from a watercourse, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to provide an adequate storm water drainage system suitable to give the existing town street and the proposed subdivision proper drainage.
i) Future development. If the town anticipates future development that will increase the drainage flow on the town street, the town may exercise the right to require additional drainage capacity in the subdivision exceeding requirements present at the time of approval of the subdivision plan. The town will participate in cost sharing for that portion of the required drainage improvements for the additional capacity.
j) Discharge. The discharge of all storm water from the subdivision shall be into suitable streams or rivers or into storm sewers, ditches, or other town drainage facilities with adequate capacity to carry the additional water. Where the discharge shall be onto private property adjoining the proposed subdivision, proper easements and discharge rights shall be secured by the subdivider for the town, and any pipe so installed shall extend a minimum distance as required by the Commission after all conditions have been considered.
k) Sections (or phases). When a subdivision is constructed in sections, the developer may be required to install drainage in future sections to provide outlets for drainage, ground water, roof drains and other problems created in the first section to be developed. Temporary rights may be required until future sections are developed.
l) Easements. Easements, at least twenty feet (20) in width, shall be provided by the subdivider for all drainage structures, swales, water lines, sewer lines or similar improvements that are not to be installed in a street. easements shall also be provided for the full width of the channel of any stream or drainage ditch in the subdivision which will carry drainage runoff from any proposed street, existing street or streets which may be constructed in the future on the undeveloped land within the watershed.

OPEN SPACE POLICY
The requirement for the dedication of open space or fee in lieu of open space to the town is noted in Section 6.8 of the Subdivision Regulations. This policy was developed by the Commission to aid the developer in addressing the open space requirements of the regulations.
Intent: It is the intent of the Commission and the regulations to provide usable open space for the enjoyment of the future residents of the subdivision or to aid in the preservation of significant natural or archaeological resources for public educational purposes.
It is the intent to create a policy that can be flexible, responsible, and serves the needs of the town. In order to ensure an understanding of the intent of the policy, it is strongly recommended that a meeting with the Town Planner be scheduled prior to designing your subdivision. If there are any questions or issues with the dedication of open space or fee in lieu of such, the Planner may refer the matter to the Commission for further review.
Criteria for the Dedication of Open Space or Payment in lieu of Fee
a) Land Dedication for all Subdivisions: The Commission desire to receive not less than eighty-thousand (80,000) square feet of land area is to be offered. The dedicated land shall contain slopes with less than a five percent (5%) grade or land that is not defined as wetland areas. Active recreational equipment may be required to serve the families within the subdivision, such as swing sets, slides or playscapes.
b) Subdivisions containing significant natural or archeological resources as identified in the Preston Plan of Conservation and Development, or by the Preston Conservation Commission, or the State of Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP): The Commission may require the dedication of such resources for open space. In addition to said dedication, the Commission may require that an educational program be developed for the general public that may include installation of interpretive signs and walking or hiking trails.
c) Subdivisions on ridgelines or containing scenic vistas or agricultural resources: The Commission may require the dedication of open space for the protection of scenic vistas or agricultural resources.
d) All other subdivisions: A fee in lieu of open space should be paid to the town when the subdivision does not meet any of the above noted criteria.
Process of Determining Fee in Lieu of Taxes: A list of three (3) appraisers shall be submitted to the Commission with the subdivision or re-subdivision application. The Commission will select an appraiser from the list. The applicant will be responsible for obtaining the appraisal by the selected appraiser from which the fee in lieu of open space will be determined. The fee shall be provided t the town prior to endorsement of the pain.

LAND USE APPLICATION
BONDING PROCESS
After approval of the application, a bond may be required to be filed with the Planning and Zoning Commission. The bond can be one of two formats: 1) a bank bond, or, 2) an insurance bond.
ACCEPTABLE BOND FORMS
Bank Bond  This format requires the applicant to obtain a letter from the bank, rather than a passbook. The letter states that the bank is placing an assignment hold on the account that will remain in the name of the applicant. The letter also states that the account cannot be withdrawn from unless approved by the Commission. The Commission has the right to withdraw from the account to complete the work in the event the applicant fails to meet the terms of the Commissions approval. The letter is signed by an authorized bank official and is consented to by the applicant. An example letter is attached to this memo that can be used by the bank. In addition to the letter, a contract legally outlines the terms of the bond. In the event the applicant is a corporation, the corporate seal must be placed on the bond contract form. Once the letter from the bank and the contract is submitted to the Town Planners office, the Town Planner will review the bond. If acceptable, it may be sent to the Town Attorney for final review and approval (generally bonds over $50,000). If there are any concerns or problems, the Town Attorney will contact the Town Planners office to request that the applicant modify the bond. Once the bond is filed and all modifications of the approval have been met, the applicant may file the signed Mylar(s) of the subdivision or site plan (if required) with the Town Clerk.
Insurance Bond  The second bond form is an insurance bond. In addition to the surety company bond form, a separate bond contract is also executed. The contract, which is attached to this memo, outlines the terms of the surety bond. All bonding companies must be licensed in the State of Connecticut. These bonds will be reviewed by the Town Planner prior to submission to the Town Attorney for signature as applicable. If the Town Attorney requests changes, the Town Planner will contact the applicant to discuss the proposed changes to be made to the bond. Once the Town Attorney approves the final bond and all modifications are made to the plan, the signed Mylar(s) may be filed with the Town Clerk.
BOND RELEASE OR REDUCTION:
After part or all of the work is completed, a written request for a release or reduction must be submitted to the Town Planners office at least two (2) weeks before the regular Planning and Zoning Commission meeting. An inspection of the work will be completed and the Planner will submit your request to the Commission along with a recommendation as to whether or not the bond shall be released or reduced. After the Commission votes to approve the reduction or release, a letter will be prepared and forwarded to the Bank/Insurance Company. The letter must be signed by both the Town Planner and the Town Treasurer in order to authorize the release. It will take about one (1) week (after the Commission action) to process the letter for release or reduction.
If there are any questions regarding the bonding format, please contact the Town Planners office at (860) 887-5581 x109.
