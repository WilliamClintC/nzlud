the "Town") finds:
A. There are or may in the future be adult-oriented business
establishments, hereinafter defined, located in or which may wish to
locate in the Town of Brookfield, which establishments require special
regulation and supervision from the Town's public safety agencies in
order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such
establishments as well as the health, safety and welfare of the Town's
citizens.
B. Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and
Towns in the United States indicate that:
(1) Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such adultoriented
business establishments;

business establishments and seek to enter or loiter about them
without the knowledge or permission of their parents and guardians;

increases in crime, drug abuse, prostitution and adverse effects on
residential neighborhoods and property values;
(5) Nude dancing, movie studios that depict principally pornographic
films for mature audiences, and sexual performances and similar
activities do not comport with the moral standards of this community,
and that by a resolution of the Town Meeting, it was found that such
businesses should be regulated to promote the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of this Town and the potential customers of
any such establishments, and that not to do so would be detrimental
to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of Brookfield;
(6) The continued unregulated operation of adult-oriented business
establishments is and would be detrimental to the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the Town of Brookfield;
(7) Despite restrictions, minors often manage to enter and view adult
materials in motion-picture theaters or video machines;
(8) The Constitution and the laws of the State of Connecticut grant
the Town powers, especially regulatory and police powers, to enact
legislation in measure to regulate and supervise such adult-oriented
business establishments in order to protect the public health, safety
and welfare; and
(9) It is the intent of the Town in enacting this chapter to impose such
limitations and restrictions as may be allowed by the United States

such violation shall be fully abated. The notice shall also include the
date, time and location of the hearing. A copy of the notice shall also
be mailed to the complainant, if applicable.
(4) The Blight Prevention Panel shall hold a hearing within 30 calendar
days of the date of the notice provided in Subsection B. At the
hearing, all persons notified shall be given the opportunity to
present evidence on the question of whether a violation of this
chapter has occurred. The Panel or parties notified may call
witnesses to present evidence.
(5) If the owner/occupant who received the notice fails to appear, the
Blight Prevention Panel may, nevertheless, determine whether a
violation has occurred, provided the Panel has made a finding that
notice was properly served.
(6) After the hearing, the Blight Prevention Panel shall make a written
determination of whether a violation exists. If the Blight Prevention
Panel determines that a violation exists, it shall include in its written
determination the actions to be taken to abate such violation and
a reasonable deadline date by which such violation shall be fully
abated.
(7) If the Blight Prevention Panel determines that no violation has
occurred, no further action as to that complaint shall be taken, and
the Blight Prevention Panel shall serve written notice that no further
action as to that complaint shall be taken, to the owner/occupant of
the premises where the possible violation existed.
(8) Whenever, in the judgment of the Director of Health, an emergency
exists, which requires immediate action to protect the public health,
safety or welfare, an order may be issued, without hearing or appeal,
directing the owner, agent, tenant or person in control of any
blighted, unsafe or dilapidated premises to take such action as
is appropriate to correct or abate the emergency situation. If
circumstances warrant, the Director of Health may immediately act
to correct or abate such emergency in accordance with statutory
authority.
B. Special consideration. Special consideration may be given to those who
require it in order to correct a violation of this chapter. Specifically, the
Blight Prevention Panel may grant an owner/occupant additional time
to correct a violation where the owner/occupant, or a person acting
on his or her behalf, establishes good cause. As used in this section
"good cause" includes, but is not limited to, an elderly individual who
is unable to personally correct a violation due to his or her age; a
disabled individual who is unable to personally correct a violation due
to his or her disability; or an exempt property as defined in this chapter.
In determining whether good cause exists, the Blight Prevention Panel
shall consider whether other occupants of the premises are able to assist
in correcting the violation in a timely fashion and whether the severity
of the violation is such that additional time is not warranted.
C. Notice of violation.

and/or fees shall be made within 10 business days of the date of

Blight Prevention Panel. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any
subsequent proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of
such owner/occupant or other person making the payment.
(2) Any owner/occupant who does not deliver or mail payment or a
written demand for a hearing within 10 business days of the date of
the citation shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the Blight
Prevention Panel shall certify to the Citation Hearing Officer that
such owner/occupant has failed to respond. The Citation Hearing
Officer shall thereupon enter and assess the civil penalties, fines,
costs and/or fees provided for by this chapter and shall follow the
procedures set forth in this chapter.
I. Hearing procedure for citations.
(1) Citation Hearing Officers are appointed in accordance with
Brookfield Code § 84-3.
(2) An owner/occupant who chooses to appeal a citation and requests a
hearing to this effect shall be given written notice of the date, time
and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than
15 calendar days nor more than 30 calendar days from the date of
mailing of the citation notice, provided the Citation Hearing Officer
shall grant, upon good cause shown, any reasonable request by a
party for a postponement or continuance. An original or certified
copy of the citation issued by the Blight Prevention Panel shall be
§ 83-4 ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 83-4
82A:91
filed with and retained by the Town and shall be deemed to be a
business record within the scope of C.G.S. § 52-180 and evidence of
the facts contained therein. Upon request of the person appealing
the citation, the presence of the Blight Prevention Panel member
who issued the citation shall be required at the hearing. A member
or members of the Panel and/or a designated Town official, other
than any Citation Hearing Officer, may present evidence on behalf
of the Town. An owner/occupant wishing to contest liability shall
appear at the hearing and may present evidence on his/her behalf.
If the owner/occupant who received the citation fails to appear, the
Citation Hearing Officer may enter an assessment by default against
him upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable
statutes and this chapter. The Citation Hearing Officer may accept
from such owner/occupant copies of any relevant investigatory and
citation reports, and/or any other official documents, by mail and
may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is
unnecessary.
(3) The Citation Hearing Officer shall conduct the hearing in the order
and form, and with such methods of proof, as the Hearing Officer
deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility
of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be
given under oath or affirmation. The Citation Hearing Officer shall
announce his decision at the end of the hearing. If the Citation
Hearing Officer determines that the owner/occupant is not liable,
the Citation Hearing Officer shall dismiss the matter and enter that
determination, in writing, accordingly. If the Citation Hearing Officer
determines that the owner/occupant is liable for the violation, the
Citation Hearing Officer shall forthwith enter and assess the civil
penalties, fines, costs and/or fees as provided by this chapter.
(4) If the Citation Hearing Officer's assessment is not paid on the date
of its entry, the Citation Hearing Officer shall send, by first-class
mail, a notice of assessment to the owner/occupant found liable and
shall file, not less than 30 calendar days nor more than 12 months
after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment
with the Clerk of the Superior Court designated by the Chief Court
Administrator, together with the applicable entry or filing fee. The
certified copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of
assessment. Within such twelve-month period, assessments against
the same owner/occupant may be accrued and filed as one record
of assessment. The Clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of
the Citation Hearing Officer's record of assessment, as well as court
costs, against such owner/occupant in favor of the Town. The
Citation Hearing Officer's assessment, when so entered as a
judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment, and a levy
of execution of such judgment may issue without further notice to
the owner/occupant.
(5) An owner/occupant against whom an assessment has been entered
pursuant to this chapter is entitled to judicial review by way of
appeal in accordance with C.G.S. § 7-152c(g).
§ 83-4 BROOKFIELD CODE § 83-4
82A:92
J. Recording of lien. Any unpaid civil penalty or other fine imposed
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and any and all costs and
expenses incurred by the Town for the enforcement of this chapter, shall
constitute a lien upon the real estate against which the civil penalty
or other fine was imposed from the date of such civil penalty or fine.
Each such lien may be continued, recorded and released in the manner
provided for in C.G.S. § 7-148aa. Each such lien shall take precedence
over all other liens filed after July 1, 1997, and encumbrances, except
taxes, and may be enforced in the same manner as property taxes.
K. Removal or remediation by Town. If the hearing officer determines
the owner/occupant is liable for the violation, the Town may cause
or take such action as is necessary to correct the violation. All costs
and expenses of such corrective action shall be a lien upon the real
estate. The Blight Prevention Panel shall cause a certificate of lien to
be recorded in the Town Clerk's office within 60 calendar days after
completion of such corrective action if all costs and expenses thereof are
not reimbursed in full by said owner/occupant.
§ 83-5. Other remedies. [Amended 9-4-2018]
The provisions of this chapter shall be in addition to all remedies civil or
criminal provided to the Town or its officials by any local, state or federal
statute or regulation, including, without limitation, the provisions of the
State Building Code, the State Fire Code and the State Public Health Code,
Zoning Regulations or other sections of the Town Code. The election of the
Town to pursue the remedies provided by this chapter shall not preclude the
Town from pursuing any other remedies available to it.
A. In addition to the remedies provided by § 83-4, if the Building Official or
Fire Marshal determines that any premises are in an unsafe condition,
or the Director of Health finds that any premises is unfit for human
habitation or violates the Connecticut General Statutes governing public
nuisances or the Zoning Enforcement Officer determines that zoning
violations exist, the Building Official, Fire Marshal, Zoning Enforcement
Officer or Director of Health may serve upon the owner of the premises
a notice detailing the condition deemed unsafe or constituting a threat
to health, safety or general welfare and specifying the required repairs
or improvements to be made to abate the unsafe, unsightly, unhealthy
or nuisance conditions. The notice may require that any building or
structure that has been determined to be a fire hazard or otherwise
dangerous to human life or the public welfare, in accordance with
General Statutes Section 29-253(b), be demolished within a certain time
period. The notice shall be delivered to the owner personally or sent
by certified mail to the last known address of the owner. If neither
method is successful, the notice shall be posted on the premises in
a conspicuous place. In the event that the owner, agent, tenant or
person in control fails to comply with the terms of the order within the
reasonable timeframe set forth in the order, the Building Official, Fire
Marshal, Zoning Enforcement Officer or Director of Health shall refer
the matter to the Blight Prevention Panel, which may: 1) instruct the
Town Attorney to take appropriate enforcement action in the courts,
§ 83-4 ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 83-5
82A:93
including, but not limited to, the commencement of an injunction action;
or 2) proceed in accordance with § 83-5B herein.
B. Demolition.
(1) The Blight Prevention Panel shall order a building or structure to be
demolished if it has been designated by the Panel as unfit for human
habitation and the Panel determines that the building or structure
constitutes a fire hazard or is otherwise dangerous to human life
or the public welfare, in accordance with General Statutes Section
29-253(b), has been posted or placarded on site as such, has been
vacated, and has not been put into proper repair so as to rescind the
designation or determination by the Panel.
(2) The owner of any building or structure which has been ordered
demolished shall be given notice of this order in the manner provided
for service of notice in § 83-5A and shall be given a reasonable
time, not to exceed 120 days, in which to demolish such building or
structure. This notice is required even if notice was previously given
pursuant to §83-5A.
(3) When the owner fails, neglects or refuses to demolish any building
or structure within the requisite time, the Blight Prevention Panel
may: a) instruct the Town Attorney to apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for a demolition order and/or other legal remedies; or
b) if the Blight Panel has determined that the building or structure
constitutes a fire hazard or is otherwise dangerous to human life
or the public welfare, then, in accordance with General Statutes
Section 29-253(b), the Town can proceed directly with demolition
of the offending building or structure. The cost of such demolition
shall create a debt in favor of the Town of Brookfield against such
owner, and the Town may record a lien, within 30 days after the
date that such demolition work has ceased, in the principal amount
of such costs and expenses in accordance with General Statutes
Section 49-73b, and shall give notice to the owner of the property
in the same manner as set forth in General Statutes Section 34-34.
Such costs shall be recoverable in a civil foreclosure or other action
brought by the Town of Brookfield which shall possess all the rights
of a municipal tax collector or as otherwise provided by law.
(4) Whenever a building or structure is demolished, whether carried out
by the owner or by the Director of Health, such demolition shall
include the filling in of the excavation on which the demolished
building or structure was located in such manner as to eliminate all
potential danger to the public health, safety and welfare arising from
such excavation.
(5) All demolition shall be preceded by an inspection of the premises by
the Director of Health to determine whether or not extermination
procedures are necessary. If the premises is found to be infested,
appropriate rodent extermination to prevent the spread of rodents to
adjoining or other areas shall be instituted before, during and after
demolition.

ARTICLE I
Citation Procedure
[Adopted 2-3-1997]
§ 84-1. Title
This article, which shall be known as the "Citation Appeal Procedure
Ordinance," is hereby adopted pursuant to the provisions of Section 7-152c
of the Connecticut General Statutes.
§ 84-2. Citation hearing procedure.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 7-152c of the Connecticut
General Statutes, the following procedure is established for the
enforcement of municipal citations:
A. At any time within 12 months from the expiration of the final period for
the uncontested payment of fines, penalties, costs or fees for any citation
issued pursuant to the provisions of the Code of the Town of Brookfield
for an alleged violation of any of the provisions of any of the ordinances
contained therein, a designated officer or employee of the Town shall
send notice to the person cited. Said notice shall inform the person cited:
(1) Of the allegations against him and the amount of the fines, penalties,
costs and fees due;
(2) That he may contest his liability before a citation hearing officer by
delivering in person or by mail written notice within 10 days thereof;
(3) That, if he does not demand a hearing, an assessment and judgment
may be entered against him; and
(4) That such judgment may issue without further notice.
B. If the person who is sent notice pursuant to the provisions of Subsection
A above wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, he may,
without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties,
costs or fees admitted to in person or by mail to an official or employee
designated by the Town. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any
proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person,
or of the person making payment. Any person who does not deliver
or mail written demand for a hearing within 10 days of the date of
the first notice provided for in Subsection A above shall be deemed to
have admitted liability, and the designated Town official or employee
shall certify such person's failure to respond to the hearing officer. The
hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines, penalties,
costs or fees provided for by the applicable ordinance and shall follow
the procedure set forth in Subsection D of this section.
C. Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of
the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held
not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days from the date of the
mailing of the notice, provided that the hearing officer shall grant, upon
good cause shown, any reasonable request by any interested party for
postponement or continuance. An original or certified copy of the initial
notice of violation issued by an issuing officer or employee of the Town
shall be filed with and retained in the records of the Town and shall be
§ 84-1 ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 84-2
82A:97
deemed to be a business record within the scope of Section 52-180 of
the Connecticut General Statutes and be evidence of the facts contained
therein. The presence of the issuing officer or employee shall be required
at the hearing if so requested by the appealing party. A person wishing
to contest his liability shall appear at the hearing and may present
evidence in his behalf. A designated Town official or employee, other
than the hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf of the Town. If
the appealing party fails to appear for the hearing, the hearing officer
may enter an assessment by default against him upon a finding of proper
notice and liability under the applicable statutes and/or ordinances. The
hearing officer may accept written statements from the appealing party,
by mail, together with any relevant supporting documents submitted by
mail by the appealing party, and may determine that the appearance of
the appealing party at the hearing is not necessary. The hearing officer
shall conduct the hearing in order and form and with such methods
of proof as he deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the
admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony
shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall
announce his decision at the end of the hearing. If he determines that
the appealing party is not liable, he shall dismiss the matter and enter
his determination in writing on the record of the proceeding. If he
determines that the appealing party is liable for the violation(s), he shall
forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against the
appealing party as provided by the applicable ordinances of the Town.
D. If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer
shall send a notice of the assessment by first class mail to the person
found liable and shall file, not less than 30 days nor more than 12 months
after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the
Clerk of the Superior Court for the geographical area, together with the
required court entry fee. The certified copy of the notice of assessment
shall constitute a record of assessment. Within said twelve-month period,
assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed with the
Court as one record of assessment. The Court Clerk shall enter judgment
in the amount of such record assessment, together with court costs,
against such person and in favor of the Town. Notwithstanding any other
provision of the General Statutes, the hearing officer's assessment, when
so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment,
and a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further
notice to such person.
E. A person against whom an assessment has been entered by the hearing
officer shall be entitled to judicial review by way of an appeal to the
Superior Court. Any such appeal must be instituted within 30 days of
the mailing of the notice of assessment by the filing of a petition to
reopen said assessment with the Superior Court for the geographical
area (GA-3), together with the required filing fee, and by service of
a copy of such petition on the Brookfield Town Clerk. The filing of a
timely petition of appeal shall entitle the appealing party to a hearing in
accordance with the Rules of the Superior Court.
§ 84-2 BROOKFIELD CODE § 84-3
82A:98
§ 84-3. Appointment and term of office for hearing officers.
The First Selectman of the Town of Brookfield shall appoint, with the
consent of the Board of Selectmen, not more than six electors of the Town
of Brookfield to be Citation Hearing Officers. Initial appointments shall
be for terms expiring on the first Tuesday of February 1998. Subsequent
appointments shall be for terms of two years. No person who has the power
to issue citations for the violation of any provision of the Code of Ordinances
of the Town shall be eligible for appointment as a hearing officer.

§ 99-1. Establishment of numbering system.
A. Map Number 3C24, entitled "Brookfield, Connecticut, Street Numbering
Sequence Map," filed at the office of the Town Clerk, shall be employed
as the basis for establishing number flow of all existing and future
streets.
B. Route 25 from the Newtown Town line north to its junction with Route 7
and then north on Route 7 to the New Milford Town line shall constitute
the base line for numbering.
C. Numbering shall be consecutive, with even numbers on the north and
west side and odd numbers on the south and east side of the streets.
In the case of a curvilinear street, the odd and even numbers shall be
determined by the direction of the major portion of the street.
D. Numbering shall start at the base line and emanate east and west from
this line for all east/west oriented streets. North/south oriented streets
shall be numbered starting at the southernmost portion. An exception
would be when a street ends in a cul-de-sac, in which case the number
shall start at the head of the street or where it initially junctions with
another street.
E. Corner lots at intersections shall be assigned a number on each street.
Those lots with a structure shall use the number assigned on the street
facing the main entrance.
§ 99-2. Determination of numbers.
Numbers shall be determined by the foot frontage:
A. For commercial and industrial zones, all numbers shall be assigned
on the basis of one number per each 50 feet, except where existing
structures dictate the necessity of numbering to be on a greater or lesser
footage.
B. For residential zones, all numbers shall be assigned on the basis of
one number per 150 feet, except where existing lot sizes dictate the
necessity of numbering to be on a greater or lesser footage.
§ 99-3. Shopping centers.
Shopping centers shall be assigned one number for the total complex. This
number shall be determined by the location of the main entrance to the
complex. If this cannot be readily determined, then that number which
corresponds with the approximate center of the structure shall be assigned.
§ 96-16 BROOKFIELD CODE § 99-4
99:118
§ 99-4. Professional buildings.
Professional buildings shall be assigned one number per building. This
number shall be determined by location of the main entrance to the building
with respect to the street-numbering sequence.
§ 99-5. Apartment and condominium complexes.
Apartment and condominium complexes shall have their own distinct
identification or street name and shall be numbered consecutively.
§ 99-6. Display of numbers.
A. When street numbering has been completed, the owner, occupant or
agent shall place or cause to be placed upon each house or building
controlled by him the number or numbers assigned.
B. Such number or numbers shall be placed on existing buildings within 30
days. The cost of the numbers shall be paid for by the property owner.
The numbers used shall not be less than three inches in height and shall
be made of a durable and clearly visible material. Failure to install the
proper number or numbers on existing buildings on or before the thirtyday
limit provided herein will subject violators to a fine of $25.
C. The number shall be conspicuously placed above, on or at the side of
the proper door of each building, so that the number can be seen plainly
from the street line. Whenever a building is set more than 75 feet from
the street line, the number shall be placed near the walk, drive way or
common entrance to such building and upon a gate post, fence, post or
other appropriate place so as to be discernible easily from the street line.
§ 99-7. Responsibility for procuring numbers.
Whenever any house, building or structure is erected, in order to preserve
the continuity and uniformity of numbering, it shall be the responsibility of
the owner or agent to procure the correct number or numbers as designated
on the Assessor's maps and/or field cards for the said property and
immediately fasten the said number or numbers so assigned as provided
in § 99-6C of this chapter. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall assign
numbers when none appear on the Assessor's map or on the field cards.

in Section 4 of Public Act No. 88-359, an additional building permit
fee shall be paid, which fee is equal to the cost incurred by the
Town of Brookfield in hiring an independent engineering consultant
to review the plans and specifications of the structure prior to its
construction to determine its compliance with the requirements of
the Connecticut Basic Building Code and to conduct such field
inspections as said consultant deems necessary. In addition to the
foregoing, if the structure exceeds the threshold limit described
above, an additional building permit fee shall be required in an
amount equal to the cost of any independent laboratory tests which
may be required by the Brookfield Building Official or the
independent engineering consultant for the purpose of testing
structural components to ensure that such components conform to
approved design specifications and drawings.
(2) In those instances where, in the opinion of the Brookfield Building
Official, a proposed structure may meet or exceed the threshold
limit described in Section 4 of Public Act No. 88-359, the property
owner, or his agent, at the time of the application for the building
permit, shall provide the Building Official with an estimate prepared
by the architect or professional engineer who designed the structure
setting forth a good-faith estimate of the cost of providing the
independent engineering consultant services and the independent
laboratory testing services required by the provisions of said Public
Act. The additional building permit fee required by Subsection B(1)
above shall be based upon said estimate and shall be paid before

the building permit is issued. In the event that the actual cost to
the Town of Brookfield incurred in providing said services is greater
than said estimate, then the difference shall be paid to the Town of
Brookfield by the property owner prior to the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy for the structure. In the event that said actual cost is
less than said estimated cost, the difference shall be refunded to the
property owner or his agent by the Town of Brookfield within 60 days
after the date of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the
structure.
C. Partial refunds of building permit fees.

pursuant to a building permit issued in accordance with the
provisions of this section and the Basic Building Code of the State
of Connecticut, the property owner or his agent may surrender the
building permit to the Building Official and request a partial refund
of the basic building permit fee. Upon the surrender of the building
permit and certification by the Building Official that no work has
been performed thereunder, the Town of Brookfield shall issue a
partial refund of the basic building permit fee, which partial refund
shall be computed as follows:
(a) The fee paid for the first $7,000 in value of work shall not be
refunded.
(b) Sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the fee paid for that portion
of the work which exceeds $7,000 in value shall be refunded to
the property owner or his agent by the Town of Brookfield. Said
refund shall be made within 60 days after the date of request
for a refund and the certification by the Building Official that no
work has been commenced pursuant to the building permit.
(2) Any additional building permit fee paid in accordance with the
provisions of Subsection B above shall be refunded at the same time
that the basic building permit fee is refunded. The amount of the
refund for the additional building permit fee shall be the amount paid
less all sums which the Town of Brookfield has paid or is obligated
to pay for an independent engineering consultant or independent
laboratory testing with reference to the proposed structure.
D. Waiver of fees.
(1) No building permit fees shall be payable with respect to any building
constructed by the Town of Brookfield for school purposes or any
other municipal purpose.
(2) The Board of Selectmen of the Town of Brookfield is hereby
empowered, in its discretion, to waive the building permit fees
imposed by this section with respect to buildings and other

organization was created.

establishments will be checked and reclassified as necessary at the
time of the licensing inspection. The fee and application form shall be
collected prior to licensing. All licenses, except for temporary events
and farmers' markets, shall expire one year from date of issue and

of Section 19a-206 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Such violation
may constitute a Class C misdemeanor, and the Director may suspend or
revoke the license of such food service establishment until such time as the
violation is removed or abated. Food service operations at the establishment
will cease until such time that the violation is removed or abated and the
Director reinstates said license and authorizes food service operations to
resume.
§ 134-7. Approval of plans and specifications required.
Whenever a food service establishment is constructed or substantially

PAINT, LEAD-BASED AND DETERIORATED
GENERAL REFERENCES
Blighted buildings  See Ch. 83. Building construction  See Ch. 96.
§ 166-1. Paint condition.
All portions of buildings used in whole or in part for residence, as well
as any accessory structures on the premises thereof, shall be kept free of
deteriorated paint, including but not limited to conditions such as cracking,
chipping, blistering, flaking, or loose paint. Such deteriorated paint
conditions shall be properly prepared, treated, and corrected in accordance
with the standards of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (RCSA)
§ 19a-111-1 et seq. (the Lead Poisoning Prevention and Control
Regulations), when applicable, and otherwise in a safe manner such that
any existing lead hazards will be eliminated and new lead hazards will
not be created. Any paint that will be used to repaint such surfaces shall
conform to the standards of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act,
Chapter 63 of the Social Security Act, the RCSA § 19a-111-1, and the RCSA
§ 21a-336-1.
§ 166-2. Lead-based paint testing (general).
The Director of Health may require the owner of a dwelling where leadbased
paint may be present to engage the services of a State of Connecticutlicensed
lead consultant contractor at the owner's expense. The licensed
lead consultant contractor shall utilize a State of Connecticut-certified lead
inspector or lead inspector/risk assessor to conduct paint testing, document
paint conditions, and evaluate compliance with the requirements of the
provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes (CGS) §§ 19a-111c and
§ 164-13 BROOKFIELD CODE § 166-2
164:154
47a-54f, and the RCSA § 19a-111-1 et seq. The owner shall provide a copy
of the report that is generated by the lead consultant contractor to the
Director of Health within a time frame that is specified by the Director of
Health.
§ 166-3. Lead-based paint testing, abatement, and lead hazard
elimination associated with lead-poisoned children.
A. Inspection and testing. Whenever the Director of Health receives a
report of lead poisoning or otherwise determines that a child under the
age of six has an abnormal body burden of lead, the Director of Health
may require the owner of the dwelling in which such child resides to
engage the services of a State of Connecticut-licensed lead consultant
contractor to inspect and test the paint, soil, water, and dust on the
premises for toxic levels of lead at the owner's expense. The owner shall
provide a copy of the lead inspection report that is generated by the
lead consultant contractor to the Director of Health within a time frame
that is specified by the Director of Health. The licensed lead consultant
contractor shall utilize a State of Connecticut-certified lead inspector or
lead inspector/risk assessor to conduct the lead inspection and testing.
B. Abatement and lead-hazard elimination. The Director of Health shall
order the abatement or elimination of hazardous conditions if the lead
content of paint, soil, water, and dust on such premises exceeds the
permissible limits thereof as established and/or referenced in this
subsection.
(1) Paint: Abatement shall be required if the lead content and condition
of paint on the premises do not conform to standards established in
the RCSA § 19a-111-1 et seq.
(2) Soil: Abatement shall be required by the Director of Health if the
lead content of bare soil areas on the premises exceeds 400 mg/kg
[400 parts per million (ppm)] or any applicable standard as may be
established in the RCSA § 19a-111-1 et seq.
(3) Dust: The Director of Health shall require the elimination of
hazardous lead dust conditions. Hazardous lead dust conditions are
lead dust levels greater than or equal to 40 micrograms per square
foot (ug/ft2) on floors, 250 ug/ft2 on window sills, and/or 400 ug/ft2 on
window wells, or any applicable standard as may be established in
the RCSA § 19a-111-1 et seq. The Director of Health may determine
that hazardous lead dust conditions exist on surfaces other than
those listed above.
(4) Water: The Director of Health shall require appropriate action to
reduce the potential for lead exposure when the lead content of
potable water exceeds 0.015 milligrams per liter [15 parts per billion
(ppb)].
§ 166-4. Lead abatement contractor.
The Director of Health may require the owner of a dwelling to engage the
services of a State of Connecticut-licensed lead abatement contractor, at
the owner's expense, to ensure compliance with standards established in
§ 166-2 OPEN SPACE USE § 166-4
164:155
the RCSA § 19a-111-1 et seq. and to abate and eliminate lead hazards as
described in § 166-3 above where, in the sole discretion of the Director of
Health, the scope of work will exceed the capability of the owner and the
owner's regular employees.
§ 166-5. Violations and penalties.
Any person, persons, or entities who are found in violation of any provision
of this chapter, shall be subject to a fine of $100 per day or per occurrence.
§ 166-6. Rationale of purpose.
Per various Connecticut statutes and regulations, local health departments
are designated as responsible parties for the comprehensive public health
oversight and management of lead-poisoned children. Additionally, local
health departments must assume a proactive role in the development and
implementation of measures that reduce the potential for lead exposure and
promote the primary prevention of lead poisoning (i.e., prior to an individual
becoming lead-poisoned). In the event that a child is lead-poisoned, the local
health department must require that appropriate measures be instituted
to prevent further lead exposure. This amendment will enable the Health
Director at the Town of Brookfield to provide these services and fulfill these
obligations in a more-effective manner.

Connecticut Public Health Code Section 19a-206, shall have the right
of entry onto any land in the Town of Brookfield for the purposes of
conducting inspections of sewage disposal systems and performing such
tests as the Health Director or his representative, in his discretion,

malfunctioning. At such time, a new operating permit shall be issued.
(3) The Health Director or his representative shall have the right to
seek judicial relief to enforce his orders for the abatement of any
§ 182-4 BROOKFIELD CODE § 182-6
179:176
violations of the provisions of the Public Health Code or of this
article.
(4) Failure on the part of a septic hauler to obtain and/or pay for a permit

Legislative Intent
§ 184-1. Legislative intent.
This chapter establishes the procedures for making connections to the
public sewer in the Town of Brookfield sanitary sewer system. It also
establishes specific limits for pollutant discharges which by their nature
or by their interaction with sewerage will be detrimental to the public
health, cause damage to the public sewer or the water pollution control
facility, pollute the waters of the state or otherwise create a public nuisance.
This chapter is intended to inform the public as to the technical and
administrative procedures to be followed in obtaining connection to the
Town of Brookfield sanitary sewer system; prevent the introduction of
pollutants into the sanitary sewer system which will interfere with the
collection and/or treatment system; prevent the introduction of pollutants
into the treatment system which will pass through the system, inadequately
treated, into the waters of the state or the atmosphere, or otherwise be
incompatible with the system; and improve the opportunity to recycle and
reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the system. This chapter shall apply
to the Town of Brookfield and to persons outside the Town of Brookfield
who are users of the public sewer. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Water Pollution Control Authority of the Town of Brookfield shall otherwise
implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter.

supplied to the individual home.
§ 192-4. Construction specifications.
A. Subgrade.
(1) The subgrade shall be prepared in an approved manner by
excavating or filling, as required. Filling shall be done in layers
not to exceed eight inches in depth, using suitable material; each
layer shall be consolidated by rolling before the next layer is placed.
Stones in earth fill shall be well distributed, and no stone over four
inches in diameter shall be left within 12 inches of the finished
subgrade.
(2) Wherever soft clay, spongy or other types of unsuitable soil which
will not compact under rolling are encountered, such soil shall be
removed and replaced with gravel or other material, approved by the
Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer, which shall be compacted as
specified above.
(3) Wherever soil is of such nature that it retains an excessive amount of
moisture, or where conditions do not afford ready natural drainage,
subdrains and underdrains shall be provided, in accordance with the
requirements of the Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer.
(4) Preparation of the subgrade shall be performed upon completion of
required excavation, filling and the installation of utilities. Where
roadways are in cut, they shall be brought to subgrade elevation for
a width of at least two feet wider than the finished pavement width,
i.e., one foot on either side.
(5) Where roadways are in embankment, the fill shall extend to
subgrade level, and for a width not less than six feet outside the
curbline, i.e., three feet on each side. The total subgrade area shall
then be thoroughly consolidated by repeated rollings, using a selfpropelled
roller weighing not less than 10 tons. Areas beyond the
above-described lines shall be excavated or filled to the full width of
the right-of-way in a method satisfactory to the Board of Selectmen
or Town Engineer.
(6) Rough tolerance. Rough subgrade shall be formed and compacted
in accordance with Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer approved
drawings, and work shall be performed within tolerance of two
inches of indicated levels.
B. Surface drainage. A complete system of surface drainage, to the
satisfaction of the Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer, including catch
basins and manholes, shall be installed, prior to the final construction
of the subgrade. Catch basins and manholes shall comply with
§ 192-3 BROOKFIELD CODE § 192-4
179:220
requirements of the standard detail. All pipe shall comply with the
Highway Specifications of the State of Connecticut.
C. Gravel course.
(1) Upon the prepared subgrade, finished parallel to and 15 inches
below the surface of the finished grade of the street, shall be spread
a layer of the approved run-of-bank gravel to a depth which, when
thoroughly compacted, shall be 10 inches. The largest stone size
permitted in this course is four inches. This course shall be rolled
with a ten-ton roller until thoroughly compacted.
(2) Inequalities in the surface shall be corrected and rolling continued
as may be necessary for a satisfactory result and to the satisfaction
of the Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer.
D. Pavement.
(1) Upon the prepared gravel course as herein described (10 inches in
thickness), a two-inch layer of screened gravel shall be placed so as
to effect a fine grade. This gravel shall be carefully spread by means
of a motorized grader and shall be wetted and thoroughly rolled with
a ten-ton roller. When completed, the surface shall be smooth and
true to line and grade parallel to the finished surface.
(2) The final wearing surface shall consist of bituminous concrete placed
in two courses. The compacted thickness of each course shall be 1 1/
2 inches. Material for this course shall conform to the requirements
of Article M.04.01, Class 1 of the Standard Specifications for Roads,
Bridges, and Incidental Construction of the Connecticut State
Highway Department, Form 810, 1969 Revision. This article is
entitled "Bituminous Concrete Mixture." The method of placing shall
conform to all the requirements of Article 4.02.03 of the abovedescribed
Standard Specifications.
E. Inspection. Before commencing any of the herein described roadway
items, it shall be the responsibility of the builder to notify the Board
of Selectmen or Town Engineer at least 48 hours in advance of his
intent to proceed. No construction shall take place without the specific
authorization, after inspection, of the Board of Selectmen or Town
Engineer.
F. Scheduling of roadway construction. In all cases the gravel course shall
weather at least one full winter (November 1 through March 31) in
place. The second of the two wearing surfaces shall be placed only at the
discretion of the Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer and only after
all patches and repairs have been made to the first course as directed.
In general, this final surface shall not be installed until a substantial
number of homes have been constructed in the subdivision. In no case
shall bituminous concrete be placed after November 1 unless specific
written approval is granted by the Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer.
§ 192-5. Storm drainage design criteria.
Storm drainage shall be provided and designed in accordance with the
following standards:
A. Pipe. Sufficient pipe shall be installed within the subdivision to carry
existing watercourses and to drain the proposed roads and/or easements
§ 192-4 SCENIC ROADS § 192-5
179:221
which may reasonably be expected to be constructed at some future
date on adjoining property which normally drains across the area of the
proposed subdivision or which, in the opinion of the Board of Selectmen
or Town Engineer, would be the most practical course for such drainage.
Cross-lot drainage shall be piped to at least 30 feet behind proposed
buildings and/or leaching systems. If in his judgment there will be no
substantial danger from soil erosion or danger to the public health
and safety, the Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer may permit the
discharge of rivers and large streams in their natural courses and may
permit the discharge of stormwater and established watercourses in
open ditches across proposed lots of one acre or larger. All pipe shall
be of such diameter, not less than 15 inches, as will, in the judgment of
the Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer, be sufficient to properly carry
stormwater expected to enter the pipe from the proposed subdivision
and from other properties when developed which normally drain across
the area of the proposed subdivision. The minimum slope for fifteeninch
pipe shall be 0.75%. The intent of this subsection is that pipes
shall be installed the full length in all proposed roads to permit the
connection of house storm drains and cellar drains where required by
ground conditions.
B. Manholes. Manholes shall be provided at each change in direction or
grade of the pipe and shall not be spaced more than 300 feet apart.
Manholes shall be constructed as shown on the standard detail. Only
precast concrete units or solid concrete blocks shall be used.
C. Catch basins.
(1) Catch basins shall be provided in order that surface water will not
travel without interception more than as shown in the following
schedule of grades and distances:
(a) Fifty-hundredths percent to 1.00%: 250 linear feet.
(b) One and zero hundredths percent to 5.00%: 300 linear feet.
(c) Five and zero hundredths percent to 10.00%: 250 linear feet.
(2) Each basin shall be connected to a manhole or adjacent catch basin
where no manhole exists. Construction shall conform to the standard
detail. Only precast concrete units or solid concrete blocks shall be
used.
D. Underdrains.
(1) In all roadway areas where a high water table is found to exist, either
before commencing or during actual construction of the roadways,
the developer shall be required to install underdrains as directed
by the Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer or his duly authorized
agent, to protect the stability of the roadway.
(2) If required, perforated concrete or metal pipe shall be used,
backfilled with washed gravel or crushed rock 1/2 inch nominal
size to a depth of at least 12 inches over the top of the pipe. The
remainder of the trench shall be backfilled with bankrun gravel as
approved by the Board of Selectmen or Town Engineer.
(3) Sufficient pitch shall be provided to allow this underground water to
run freely to a point of discharge. The size and type of conduit shall
be as directed by the Engineer.
§ 192-5 BROOKFIELD CODE § 192-5
179:222
E. Discharge. The discharge of all stormwater shall be into suitable
drainage structures or watercourses. Where the discharge shall be onto
private property within or adjoining the proposed subdivision, property
easements and discharge rights for the Board of Selectmen or Town
Engineer shall be secured by the applicant before approval of the final
map and acceptance of the drainage plan is requested by the developer.
§ 192-6. Storm drainage construction specifications.
The storm drainage system shall be constructed in accordance with the
following standards and procedures:
A. Pipe. All pipe used shall be of reinforced concrete meeting State
Highway Department specifications. In some instances the Engineer may
recommend use of corrugated metal pipe where he feels such pipe will
provide a more satisfactory drainage system.
B. Joints. The joints of all pipe shall be shoved tight. Pipe laid in sandy,
silty or other soil where, in the judgment of the Engineer, there is the
possibility of silting shall have joints thoroughly sealed with 1:3 portland
cement mortar or other approved method.
C. Catch basins and manholes. Catch basins and manholes shall be
constructed in accordance with the approved plans. Manholes shall be
constructed of solid concrete radial manhole blocks eight inches thick or
of precast concrete units. Catch basins shall be constructed of eight-inch
solid concrete blocks or precast concrete units.
D. Headwall, culverts and bridges. Headwalls, culverts and bridges shall
be constructed where required, in accordance with good engineering
practice and as specified by the Engineer.
E. Open ditches. Open ditches may be permitted at the discretion of the
Engineer. The size of the waterway shall be of sufficient size to convey all
water expected to be discharged and shall be suitably stabilized against
erosion. The side banks shall be moderately sloped, not less than three
horizontal to one vertical and then seeded or otherwise stabilized paved
bottom sections and rip-rap slopes shall be provided when directed by
the Engineer to prevent scour and erosion.
§ 192-7. Guard railings.
When, in the opinion of the Engineer, a guard railing is necessary to protect
the traveling public, the subdivider shall install same as directed. The
guard railing shall consist of the two-cable variety and shall conform to the
applicable State Highway Department specification.
§ 192-8. Utilities.
Prior to the placement of the base course, all utilities are to be installed
together with service extensions to each lot within the property line. The
intent of this section is to provide all required underground services to each
lot prior to the placement of base course and finished pavement.
§ 192-9. Submission of as-built drawings.
§ 192-5 SCENIC ROADS § 192-9
179:223
A. Prior to consideration for acceptance as a public highway, the developer
shall submit as-built drawings, at a scale of one inch equals 40 feet
horizontal, one inch equals four feet vertical. Such drawings shall be
on plan-profile sheets and shall not exceed 36 inches by 24 inches in
size. Drawings shall be prepared by a person registered as a professional
engineer in the State of Connecticut and shall show the following detail:
(1) Concrete monuments delineating the right-of-way.
(2) Edge of paved surfaces as they relate to right-of-way.
(3) A center-line profile of the paved surface.
(4) The location and size of all sanitary and storm sewer conduits and
structures, including invert elevation of same.
(5) Bearings and distances on all right-of-way boundaries tied into the
monuments described above.
(6) Drainage easements as shown on the approved subdivision plan.
B. The original of this plan shall be delivered to the Board of Selectmen or
Town Engineer, and said plan shall be reviewed as to conformance with
these standards before submission to the legislative body for approval.

Brookfield, the Chief of Police may order the person responsible for such
work to secure police traffic control to insure the safe and orderly flow
of the traffic and the prompt enforcement of traffic laws. The cost of
such police supervision shall be assumed by the person conducting such
construction, excavation or repair. In exercising his decision of whether or
not to require police personnel for such activities, the Chief of Police shall
take into account the width and condition of the proposed road site and
surrounding roads, the posted speed limit, the time of day during which
activities will occur in relationship to peak volume of traffic, the normal
volume of traffic expected upon said road during said hours, the line of
sight, known traffic patterns including excessive speeds or accidents known
for the site or the vicinity, the scope and length of time of the proposed
construction, excavation or repair activity, and such other factors as may
impact safety at the site as may be appropriate. The Chief of Police or, in
his absence, the next in command, shall render his decision on whether or
not police supervision is required within 72 hours (excluding any portion
§ 192-15 BROOKFIELD CODE § 192-17

application for a decision on such issue. Absent the rendering of a decision
within such time frame, it shall be assumed that the Chief of Police or his
next in command has determined that police supervision is not necessary
for the site. Any decision of the Chief of Police or his next in command
under this section may be appealed to the Police Commission by any party
aggrieved thereby by filing a written objection within five days of such
decision with the Police Commission in care of the Brookfield Town Clerk.
The Police Commission shall hear such appeal in an open forum and render
a decision thereon within 60 days of filing any appeal. Upon the failure of
the Police Commission to render a decision within 60 days, any appeal by
an applicant shall be deemed to be sustained. Anyone receiving an adverse
decision from the Police Commission may pursue such other appeals or
legal remedies to the Superior Court as may exist under the law.

or under any street breaks, bursts or otherwise is in such condition as to
immediately endanger the property, life, health or safety of any individual,
the person owning or controlling such sewer, main, conduit or utility,
without first applying for and obtaining an excavation permit hereunder,
shall immediately take proper emergency measures to cure or remedy the
dangerous conditions for the protection of property, life, health and safety
of individuals. However, such person owning or controlling such facility
shall apply for a permit not later than the end of the next succeeding day
during which the office of the Director of Public Works is open for business
and shall not proceed with permanent repairs without first obtaining an
excavation permit hereunder.
§ 192-19. Provisions not applicable to overhead services.
This article shall not be construed to apply to the installation or
replacement by a public utility of overhead services, provided that the limit
of the work area does not disturb nor damage the paved or surfaced streets
or public rights-of-way. Notwithstanding this exemption, no person or firm
so engaged shall park his or its equipment or vehicles in such a manner as
to impede traffic, create any hazardous conditions nor otherwise violate any
provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes.
§ 192-20. Word usage.

given, such person must first apply for tax relief under any state statute
for which he or she is eligible. If such applicant has not applied for tax
relief under any state statute because he or she is not eligible, he or
she shall so certify by filing, on a form acceptable to the Assessor, an
affidavit testifying to his or her ineligibility.
F. An initial application must be filed with the Assessor not earlier than
February 1 nor later than May 15 for tax credit for the next fiscal year.
Subsequent applications to continue to receive said tax credit must be
filed annually with the Assessor between February 1 and May 15 of each
year.
G. Such person shall not have received qualifying income during the
calendar year preceding the fiscal year for which tax relief is claimed in
excess of 140% of the "qualifying income" amounts set forth in C.G.S.
§ 197-1 SCENIC ROADS § 197-2
179:241
§ 12-170aa(b) and adjusted annually by the Secretary of the Office of
Policy and Management as provided for in C.G.S. § 12-170aa(b)(2). For
purposes hereof, "qualifying income" shall be defined to include adjusted
gross income (as defined by the federal income tax) plus tax-exempt
interest plus Social Security benefits not included in adjusted gross
income. No tax credit shall be given if income exceeds the dollar
amounts referenced above.
H. No tax credits shall be given under this article to any persons who have
delinquent taxes owed to the Town of Brookfield.
§ 197-3. Limitations on property for which credit is applicable.
The tax credit for real property as provided herein shall apply to only the
residence itself, the lot on which the residence is located, but not more than
two acres, and the improvements thereon.
§ 197-4. Determination of amount of credit.
A. The Assessor shall determine whether each applying taxpayer is entitled
to tax credit under this article and shall compute the amount of tax
credit to which each qualified taxpayer is entitled and cause a certificate
of tax credit to be issued in such form as to permit the Tax Collector
to reduce the amount of tax levied against the taxpayer or issue a tax
credit and make proper record thereof. The tax credit shall be applied
proportionately to the tax payments.
B. The amount of the tax credit available to a qualifying taxpayer shall be
equal to 1/3 of the following: the applicable median assessment value
of a principal residence in the Town of Brookfield multiplied by the
applicable mill rate for said fiscal year.
C. The tax relief herein provided, together with all tax relief benefits
obtained from the State of Connecticut pursuant to state law, shall not
result in a reduction of the taxpayer's total real estate tax by more than
75% of the amount which would be laid against the taxpayer were no
tax relief of any kind provided. In the event that all tax relief benefits
obtained from the State of Connecticut, together with the benefit
provided for by this article, result in a reduction of the taxpayer's total
real estate tax by more than 75%, then the tax relief provided for by this
article shall be reduced by the amount necessary to prevent all tax relief
from exceeding said 75% in the aggregate.
D. If the taxpayer has qualified and received tax relief under the provisions
of this article and subsequently becomes disqualified for any reason, he
shall notify the Tax Assessor on or before April 1 of the year in which he
becomes disqualified and he shall be denied tax relief under this article
for such fiscal year and until he has again applied and qualified for relief
under this article.78

shall be given for the next fiscal year. If such person dies after June
15, the tax credit for which such person applied prior to his death shall
be granted, but no additional tax credit shall be allowed for his or her
interest in the property for any fiscal years thereafter.
B. If any person entitled to the tax credit pursuant to this article sells the
property on which the tax credit is granted, no additional tax credit shall
be allowed for his or her interest in the property for any fiscal years
commencing after the date of the sale of the property, and provided
further that the purchaser of such property shall pay the Town a
prorated share of the tax credit as provided by Section 12-81a of the
Connecticut General Statutes.
§ 197-6. Property held in multiple ownership.
Only one tax credit shall be allowed for each parcel of land eligible for the
tax credit under this article. In any case where title to such real property is
recorded in the name of the taxpayer or his or her spouse, who is eligible
for tax credit, and any other person or persons, the tax amount shall be
prorated to allow a tax credit equivalent to the fractional share in the
property of such taxpayer or spouse, and if such property is multiple-family
dwelling, such credit shall be prorated to reflect the fractional portion of
such property occupied by the taxpayer, as provided by state statutes, as
they may be amended. Persons not otherwise eligible shall not receive any
tax credit.
§ 197-7. Limitation on total of credits throughout Town. [Amended
5-2-2011]
The total of all tax credits granted under this article shall not exceed for
each fiscal year an amount equal to 1% of the total real estate property

preceding the year the tax credit is effective; in such event, the tax credits

allow a tax deferral equivalent to the fractional share in the property of
§ 197-26.1 SCENIC ROADS § 197-28
179:253
such taxpayer or spouse. If such property is a multiple-family dwelling,
such deferral shall be prorated to reflect the fractional portion of such

§ 197-29. Determination of amount of deferral.
A. The total tax deferred shall be equal to 45% of the real property tax
which would be assessed on the median assessment value of a principal

A. The Town of Brookfield shall establish a lien on each property that is
subject to tax deferral hereunder in the amount of the relief granted,
together with interest at a rate equal to the S&P Municipal Bond 20
Year High Grade Rate Index or similar index as approved by the Board
of Selectmen as of January 1 of each calendar year. Said lien shall have
a priority in the settlement of the taxpayer's estate. Each subsequent
annual deferral shall accrue simple annual interest at a rate equal to the
interest rate as of January 1 of the respective calendar year.
B. Each tax deferral granted in accordance with the provisions of this
article shall terminate upon the death of the taxpayer or upon the
transfer, assignment, grant or conveyance of the property subject to

for each assessment year an amount equal to 3% of the total real estate
property tax assessed in the Town of Brookfield. In the event this limitation

prorated in such a manner so that the total amount of property tax relief
hereunder shall remain within the limits fixed herein.
§ 197-32. Determination of eligibility; applicability; disqualification;
transfer of property.
A. Tax Assessor shall determine whether each applying taxpayer is entitled
to a tax deferral under this article and shall compute the amount of the
tax deferral to which each qualified taxpayer is entitled and cause a
certificate of tax deferral to be issued in such form as to permit the Tax
Collector to reduce the amount of tax levied against the taxpayer. The tax
§ 197-28 BROOKFIELD CODE § 197-32
179:254
deferral shall be applied proportionately to the tax payments due during
the course of each tax year.
B. The tax deferral allowed hereunder shall not apply to any water use
charge, sewer use charge or special tax assessments that may be levied
against real property in the Town of Brookfield.
C. If a taxpayer has qualified and received tax relief under the provisions of
this article and subsequently becomes disqualified for any reason, he or
she shall notify the Tax Assessor on or before the next assessment date
and his or her exemption shall cease for such assessment year and such
disqualification shall continue until he or she becomes eligible again and
has filed a new application.
D. If any person with respect to whom a claim for tax relief in accordance
with this article has been approved for any assessment year transfers,
assigns, grants or otherwise conveys in such assessment year the
interest in real property to which such claim for tax relief is related,
regardless of whether such transfer, assignment, grant or conveyance
is voluntary or involuntary, the amount of such tax deferral shall be a
pro rata portion of the amount otherwise applicable in such assessment
year to be determined by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the
number of full months from the first day of October in such assessment
year to the date of such conveyance and the denominator of which shall
be 12. If such conveyance occurs in the month of October, the grantor
shall be disqualified for tax relief in such assessment year. The grantee
shall be required, within a period not exceeding 10 days immediately
following the date of such conveyance, to notify the Assessor thereof,
whereupon the Assessor shall determine the amount of tax deferral to
which the grantor is entitled for such assessment year with respect to
the interest in real property conveyed and notify the Tax Collector of
the reduced amount of tax deferral applicable to such interest. Upon
receipt of such notice from the Assessor, the Tax Collector shall, if such
notice is received after the tax due date in the municipality, within 10
days thereafter, mail or hand a bill to the grantee stating the additional
amount of tax due as determined by the Assessor. Such tax shall be due
and payable and collectible as other property taxes and subject to the
same liens and processes of collection, provided such tax shall be due
and payable in an initial or single installment not sooner than 30 days
after the date such bill is mailed or handed to the grantee and in equal
amounts in any remaining, regular installments as the same are due and
payable.

B. The applicant is not delinquent with respect to property taxes or other
obligations owed to the Town of Brookfield or the Water Pollution Control
Authority, such as water and sewer fees and assessments, with respect
to the subject property or any other property owned by the applicant;

proposed construction and/or improvements will be of sufficient benefit
to the Town of Brookfield and its citizens to warrant approving the
application for tax deferral; and
D. The subject property does not have frontage on Federal Road south of
the junction of Federal Road and Route 133.
§ 197-40. Application procedure.
A. All applications shall be submitted to the Town of Brookfield First

him/her and shall forward each such application to the Board of
Selectmen within 45 days of receipt, together with his/her report
concerning whether or not the application meets the eligibility criteria
contained in this article. In the event that the application is for an
agreement that deviates from the minimum fixed assessment schedule

§ 197-42. Effective date of deferral.
The approved tax deferral shall be effective upon the date of the last of all
of the following to occur:
A. Completion of construction or improvements;
§ 197-40 BROOKFIELD CODE § 197-42
179:260
B. The issuance of a final certificate of occupancy for the completed
construction and/or improvements; and
C. Certification by the Tax Assessor as set forth in this article. Deferral will
be applied on a pro rata basis, so that any scheduled first-year benefit
commencing on the date of the final certificate of occupancy will be
continued from one assessment year to the next, as required, and for
subsequent assessment years until the scheduled benefit expires. The
continuance of the approved tax deferral shall be subject to the default
provisions set forth in § 197-43 of this article and the contingencies set
forth therein.
§ 197-43. Assessment deferral agreement.
The Board of Selectmen reserves the right, upon the applicants request,
to enter into an assessment deferral agreement with individual applicants
for deferral schedules other than the minimum fixed assessment schedule
set forth in § 197-41, within statutorily authorized limits set forth in
Connecticut General Statutes Section 12-65b, as from time to time
amended, and for the uses set forth in § 197-39. Agreements shall be
predicated upon a finding by the Board of Selectmen, with advice from
other Town officials as required, that the public benefit to the Town that is
likely to result from the proposed construction or improvements is sufficient
to warrant consideration for a tax deferral exceeding the minimum fixed
assessment schedule set forth in § 197-41.
A. The assessment deferral agreement to be signed by the applicant and
the First Selectman on behalf of the Town shall refer to and incorporate
the application as approved by the Board of Selectmen, shall reflect the
assessment on the property immediately prior to the commencement of
construction, and shall specify the period of deferral.
B. The assessment deferral agreement shall provide that, upon completion
of construction or improvements made in accordance with the terms of
the agreement, and upon certification by the Tax Assessor, as set forth
in this article and upon issuance of the final certificate of occupancy,
the increase in the assessment on the property due to such construction
or improvements shall be deferred in accordance with a statutorily
authorized schedule, as determined by the Board of Selectmen.
C. The assessment deferral agreement shall provide that such construction
or improvements shall be completed by a date fixed in the agreement.
In the event that on the date so fixed for completion the Tax Assessor
denies certification that the construction or improvements have been
performed in accordance with the eligibility criteria as set forth in this
section and/or in accordance with the terms of the assessment deferral
agreement, or at any time if the Tax Assessor determines that the owner
or lessee of the property is in default under the terms of the agreement,
and has failed to cure said default after notice and an opportunity to
do so within the time stated in the notice from the Tax Assessor, the
agreement shall automatically terminate. In the event of termination, the
owner and/or lessee of the property, as herein provided, shall be liable
for any increase in taxes for which he/she would have been liable in the
absence of such assessment deferral agreement. The agreement shall
§ 197-42 SCENIC ROADS § 197-43
179:261
further provide that a property owner or lessee, as herein provided, may
apply, prior to expiration, to the Board of Selectmen for an extension of
time in which to complete the construction or improvements which, for
good cause shown, the Board of Selectmen may approve, but in no event
shall such extension of time exceed a period of one year.
D. The assessment deferral agreement shall further provide that the
agreement is subject to the following conditions:
(1) That, in addition to the certification requirement of Subsection C
above, the property shall be subject to inspection and certification
by the Building Official and Health Director as being in conformance
with such provisions of the state Building and Health Codes and local
Housing Codes as may apply, and by the Zoning Enforcement Officer
to ensure conformance with the Zoning Regulations, and must be in
compliance with all other codes or state and local laws applicable to
the new construction and/or improvements;
(2) That the assessment deferral agreement shall continue only for as
long as the use of the property remains the use authorized by §
197-39 and set forth in the agreement and shall provide that the
property owner or lessee, as the case may be, shall annually certify
to the Tax Assessor on a specified date that the property is used for
the authorized use set forth in the assessment deferral agreement;
(3) That the assessment deferral agreement shall automatically
terminate without notice if there is any delinquency in the payment
of property taxes or other obligations on the subject property owed
to the Town of Brookfield or the Water Pollution Control Authority,
such as water and sewer fees and assessments, as of one month
following the due date for the payment;
(4) That the assessment deferral agreement shall automatically
terminate without notice upon the date of the sale or transfer of
the improvements unless the new owner or lessee, as the case may
be, of such property shall enter into a new contract with the Town
incorporating all the terms of the agreement with the former owner
or lessee, as herein provided; and
(5) The subject construction and/or work on the improvements must
commence within 12 months from the date of the assessment
deferral agreement, and the final certificate of occupancy must be
issued within 24 months from the date of the agreement, except
where these time frames are expressly modified by the terms of the
agreement. The failure to adhere to any of the required time frames
in this subsection shall result in the automatic termination, without
notice, of the agreement.
§ 197-44. Additional provisions and requirements.
A. The Tax Assessor, after consulting with the Building Official, shall have
the sole responsibility of determining the cost and value of the
construction or improvements that are subject to a deferral of
assessment increases pursuant to this article.
§ 197-43 BROOKFIELD CODE § 197-44
179:262
B. A copy of any assessment deferral agreement entered into pursuant to
the provisions of this article shall be forwarded to the Tax Assessor, who
shall adjust his/her records accordingly.
C. The Tax Assessor shall forward a copy of a certification that the
construction or improvements have been completed in accordance with
the assessment deferral agreement to the First Selectman. In the event
that the Tax Assessor denies such certification, the Tax Assessor shall
send a copy of the denial, including the reasons for denial, to the
First Selectman, who shall then inform the Board of Selectmen that the
certification was denied and that the tax deferral will not commence.
Upon such denial of certification by the Tax Assessor or upon a
termination of the agreement, the Tax Assessor shall readjust his/her tax
records in accordance with the provisions of this article.
D. Any agreement entered into under the provisions of this article shall be
recorded on the land records of the Town.
E. The Board of Selectmen may establish written procedures and technical
specifications for the administration of this article.
F. Properties upon which construction or improvements commenced prior
to the adoption of this article, but which have not yet received a final
certificate of occupancy, may be eligible for the benefits set forth in
this article, provided that they meet the requirements of, and apply in
accordance with, the provisions of this article.
§ 197-45. Eligible personal property.
Pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes Section 12-65h, the Board of
Selectmen may approve an agreement to defer the increase in assessment
of certain personal property to be located, or that is proposed to be located,
in a manufacturing facility as defined in General Statutes Section
12-81(72), subject to the requirements of Section 12-65h. The
determination and approval of any such agreement shall be based upon the
general guidelines, standards and requirements set forth in this Business
Incentive Tax article that could properly be applied to a review of, and the
terms of, an assessment deferral agreement for eligible personal property.

ARTICLE I
Water System
[Adopted 8-13-201080]
§ 215-1. Authority.
The Board of Selectmen of the Town of Brookfield is hereby empowered
to administer the planning, construction and financing of water systems
and mains within the Town and, subject to the provisions of this article,
the Board may take all necessary or desirable actions in connection with
such extensions of water mains, including the levying and collection of
assessments pursuant to § 7-137c of the General Statutes of Connecticut,
Revision of 1958, as amended from time to time (the General Statutes).
§ 215-2. Reimbursement required.
A. Each owner of property shall, pursuant to the provisions of this article,
and in accordance with said C.G.S. § 7-137c, reimburse the Town for
the proportionate share of the total costs to the Town of the extension
of any water main which abuts such property. The amount of such
reimbursement shall be computed in such manner as to leave the Town
ultimately free of any of the cost of the extension of the water main
and expenses incidental thereto, except that where any portion of such
water service is to be used for a municipal purpose of the Town, the
Town shall contribute a fair proportion of the expense representing
such proportionate municipal share. Such expenses shall include, but
are not limited to, any costs of materials, installation, pumping stations,
service connections, curb, sidewalk and highway repairs, installation
of gate valves and shutoffs, right-of-way acquisition, interest and costs
of borrowing, whether temporary or permanent, administrative costs
for billing and accounting, all engineering and legal fees pertaining to
the extension and any other costs associated with the extension. The
costs of an extension of a water main shall also include the cost of
improvements, upgrades, replacements or repairs made by the Town in
order to preserve or enhance the water system, including but not limited
to pump station upgrades, water treatment upgrades and storage tanks.
B. In the case of land containing no improvements which is zoned for other
than commercial or industrial purposes or classified, pursuant to the
provisions of the General Statutes as farmland, forest land or open space
land on the last completed Grant List of the Town, which exceeds the
size of the smallest lot permitted in the lowest density residential zone
allowed under the zoning regulations of the Town by more than 100%,
the assessment of such excess land shall be deferred until such time as
such excess land shall be built upon or a building permit issued therefor
or until approval of a subdivision plan of such excess property, whichever
event occurs first, at which time the assessment shall be made. The
Board of Selectmen shall cause a caveat to be placed on the Brookfield
land records in each instance where an assessment is deferred.

§ 215-1 TREES § 215-3
201:271
§ 215-3. Assessments.
A. The benefit assessment of each owner of property abutting the water
main shall be assessed by the Board of Selectmen or such authority as it
may designate.
B. Subject to reasonable allowance by the Board of Selectmen for
particular situations, the benefit assessment for each property in a water
main extension project shall be based upon the following factors:
(1) Area: For purposes of this article, the area shall equal the area
of land contained within the property lines of a lot. For common
interest communities, the area of each property shall equal the
total area of land of the common interest community divided by the
number of units.
(2) Frontage: For purposes of this article, any lot with a front lot line
on a street shall be deemed to have a minimum frontage of 50 feet
even if the actual frontage is less, and any interior lot benefited by an
extension shall be deemed to have frontage equal to the greater of
(a) the actual front lot line; (b) the distance between the side lot lines
measured in a straight line at right angles to the mean direction of
such side lot lines, which line or measurement shall touch but not be
in front of the building line; or (c) 50 feet even if the lot has no actual
frontage. The frontage of a corner lot which is at the intersection of
and abuts two or more streets, when the angle of the intersection is
not more than 135°, or where the intersection is rounded by a curve
having a radius of less than 100 feet, shall be the sum of the sides
(a side being a minimum of 50 feet for these calculations) divided
by the number of sides. Each unit in a common interest community
shall be deemed to have frontage equal to the frontage of the entire
lot, as described above, divided by the number of units or 25 feet,
whichever is greater.
(3) Number of building units: as to residential property, number of
dwelling units permitted under the current zoning classification of
the property or the existing number of units thereon, whichever
is greater. As to a common interest community or condominium,
the number of building units shall be equal to the number of units
created. As to property zoned commercial, industrial or for other
nonresidential zones, a unit shall constitute, for assessment
purposes, an area of 5,000 square feet even if the actual property
is less than 5,000 square feet. Any such property containing more
than 5,000 square feet which does not constitute a full unit shall
be assessed based on the percentage the excess bears to a full unit
of 5,000 square feet. If a property is partially in a residential zone
and partially in a commercial, industrial or other zone, the number
of units for each portion shall be determined in accordance with
the zoning classification applicable to that portion and then added
together to yield a total number of units for the property.
(4) The Grand List: Grand List valuation of the property, including both
land and buildings. Each of the above factors shall be given a weight
of 25%. The weighted factors shall be used to apportion the expense
of the extension among the properties to be assessed. The
§ 215-3 BROOKFIELD CODE § 215-3
201:272
assessment of an individual parcel thus shall equal the product of the
total cost of the extension (as described in § 215-2 above) multiplied
by 0.25 of the sum of the following quotients:
(a) The area of the parcel divided by the area of all of the parcels to
be assessed;
(b) The frontage of the parcel divided by the total frontage of all of
the parcels to be assessed;
(c) The number of building units assigned to the parcel divided by
the total of all building units to be assessed; plus
(d) The Grand List valuation of the parcel divided by the total Grant
List valuation of all of the parcels to be assessed.
C. For purposes of measurements, the Town Assessor's maps shall be
deemed accurate unless otherwise shown by a Class A-2 survey certified
by a registered land surveyor.
D. If a property abuts more than one municipal water main, it will be
assessed as if it abutted only one water main. The street address listed in
the Assessor's Grand List shall determine which water main assessment
will apply.
E. If, given unusual conditions specific to a particular property, the formula
above, in the sole discretion of the Board of Selectmen, fails to
adequately encompass the full costs to the Town or is otherwise
inequitable, the Board of Selectmen shall determine the assessment
in an equitable manner. By way of examples: to the extent that soil
or groundwater pollution adds to the expense of the extension, those
additional expenses may be assessed against the properties that are the
source of the pollution; or if a property abutting a water main is already
served by a public water system owned and operated by the public water
utility assigned to that exclusive service area, then the assessment may
be deferred until the property connects to the Town's water main.
F. If assessments, individually and collectively, in the sole discretion of
the Board of Selectmen fail to adequately reimburse the full costs to
the Town or are inequitable, they may be adjusted by the Board of
Selectmen. [Added 6-3-2013]
§ 215-4. Hearings.
In the case of any assessment to be levied pursuant to this article, pursuant
to § 7-141 of the General Statutes, notice of the time and place for a hearing
upon such assessment shall be published at least 10 days before the date
thereof in a newspaper having circulation in the Town, and a copy of such
notice signed by the Town Clerk shall be mailed to the record owner of any
property to be affected thereby.
§ 215-5. Notice of assessment of benefits.
When the Board of Selectmen has determined the amount of the assessment
to be levied, it shall file a copy thereof in the office of the Brookfield Town
Clerk. Not later than five days after such filing, it shall cause a copy of such
assessment to be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in
§ 215-3 TREES § 215-5
201:273
the Town, and it shall mail a copy of such assessment to the record owner
of any property affected thereby.
§ 215-6. Appeals.
The owner of any property so assessed may appeal to the Superior Court
from the valuation of such owner's assessment in accordance with and
subject to the limitations of § 7-137c of the General Statutes.
§ 215-7. Payment of assessments.
A. Assessments shall be due and payable to the Brookfield Tax Collector 30
days after billing of the assessment to the property owner. Delinquent
assessments shall bear interest at the rate and manner provided for by
statute for delinquent property taxes.
B. The Board of Selectmen may allow assessments to be paid in
installments over a period not exceeding 20 years or such lesser time
as the Board determines. The Board of Selectmen shall fix the rate of
interest to be paid on the outstanding balance of the installments.
C. Any assessment or installment payment which is not paid when due
shall bear interest at the maximum statutory rate permitted by law
for delinquent property taxes. Such assessment, together with interest
thereon, shall constitute a lien against such property and the Tax
Collector shall cause a certificate of lien for each such assessment to be
lodged with the Town Clerk as provided in § 7-137d of the Connecticut
General Statutes. A lien may be foreclosed in the manner provided by
law for foreclosure of tax liens.

otherwise expanded, extended or altered in any vertical or horizontal
direction from a structure into a building.

D. Development Standards and Controls
Except as specified in this section, all development standards and controls applicable
to other residential subdivisions shall be applicable to conservation subdivisions. The
following standards are to be considered minimums that may be increased in specific
instances where determined necessary or appropriate by the Planning Commission:
1. Density: The maximum permitted number of one-family building lots within a
conservation subdivision shall be determined by dividing the land area of the
subject property by the normal minimum required lot area for one-family
dwellings for the district or districts in which the property is located, except that
the Planning Commission may reduce the permitted number of lots so
calculated if, in the Commission's opinion, such reduction is warranted based
upon the presence of substantial areas of poor soils and/or other severe
topographic limitations of the subject property that would tend to inhibit
development at such a density.
2. Minimum required lot area: The minimum required lot area for one-family
dwellings in a conservation subdivision shall be 20,000 square feet, except that
larger minimums may be required in specific instances where determined
necessary or appropriate by the Planning Commission or by the Health Director
of the Town of Brookfield.
3. Minimum required lot width: The minimum required lot width for a one-family
building lot in a conservation subdivision shall be 100 feet.
4. Minimum required yards: The minimum required yards for a one-family building
lot in a conservation subdivision shall be as follows, except that where such
building lots adjoin private property not included within the conservation
subdivision the minimum yard requirements normally applicable to buildings
within the zoning district in which the property is located shall apply to setbacks
from such adjoining property lines:
a. Front yard: 30 feet from the front lot line.
b. Side yards: 15 feet minimum; the aggregate of both side yards shall not be
less than 45 feet.
c. Rear yard: 25 feet.
E. Conserved Land Areas
1. All land within a conservation subdivision which is not included with a onefamily
building lot or designated to serve as roads or for other public purposes
shall be designated "conserved land area(s)" on the final subdivision plan. The
conserved land areas shall be in such location and/or such size and shape and
shall have such access as may be approved by the Planning Commission as
being appropriate to satisfy the purposes set forth in this section.

Article 5  Special Districts
5.1 Town Center District (TCD)
A. Purpose
This district encompasses the historical business center of the town. Many business
establishments within the district have been in operation prior to the enactment of the
Regulations, and physical conditions exist which limit their compliance with regulatory
requirements and/or good planning principles. It is considered in the best economic interest
of the Town to foster business development of both new and existing establishments in a
planned, integrated, and orderly manner and in such a way as to complement the historic
character and traditions of the district.
In the future, the Four Corners will become a center of activity in Brookfield and a
destination. It will be a downtown for Brookfield that is well defined visually and
aesthetically, providing a positive experience for residents and visitors, with a distinctive
identity that is well known throughout Brookfield and the region. Development will have
complementary scale, character, and density that will contribute to a sense of both history
and vitality. It will offer places to live, work, shop, eat, and find entertainment and cultural
enrichment. The area will provide a diversity of services that enhance the quality of life for
residents and invite travelers to stop. This will be complemented by access to the Still River as
a scenic resource in the Four Corners. It will have complementary civic spaces in the form of
outdoor parks and plazas and public community facilities. Most new development will result
from infill and from reuse or redevelopment of existing sites. No new strip or large-scale
single-use developments will be built.
The area will be easy to access and navigate by car, bicycle, transit, and on foot. There will
be a variety of opportunities to travel by all these means along all roads within the Four
Corners area including walking, biking, rail, and bus along with key connections among
those means. Streets in the Four Corners will offer a balance among motor vehicle and
pedestrian and bicycle traffic, with an enhanced streetscape that is pedestrian friendly and
complementary to the character of the area. This will be accomplished through
improvements such as landscaped sidewalks, aesthetic lighting, and areas to pause and
relax such as plazas with benches near public art and other public spaces. Traffic on Route 7
will flow at reasonable speeds through the area as a result of measures designed to
encourage drivers to slow down, improve safety, and minimize any degradation of the
character of this special place.
B. Plan of Conservation and Development
The Commission shall use the Plan of Conservation and Development as amended to include
the Four Corners Revitalization Plan, approved by the Planning Commission, Town of
Brookfield, as a guide in reviewing all applications for design review approval within the
district. In particular, the Commission shall consider and be guided by the various aspects of

concepts, bridges and walkways, service areas, common areas and open space, potential
housing sites, access drives, vehicle and pedestrian circulation patterns, and common
parking areas in addition to other elements.
C. Common Service Areas
In order to provide for services to the district as a whole, certain areas within the district may
be acquired by various business entities and held in common under a condominium
association or similar entity. Such service areas may consist of access drives, parking areas,
area lighting, utility facilities, walkways, seating, landscaped areas, etc.

One-family dwellings, PARCs, and Multi-Family Dwellings (notwithstanding point 2
above) are permitted only in the TCD Perimeter Overlay Zone (see Section 5.2 of these
Regulations).
4. Square Footage Restriction
Each new structure permitted within the district shall not exceed a footprint of 12,000
square feet, except when the new structure is a supermarket/grocery store or
municipal building, when the footprint shall not exceed 20,000 square feet.
5. Drive-Thru Facility

the TCD.
I. Parking
1. Off-Site Parking - Notwithstanding 6.1, if a business has insufficient parking to meet
the regulatory requirements on the site where the business is established, the business
may satisfy the requirement by acquiring (lease or purchase) the additional required
parking spaces on an off-site location approved by the Commission. In such
instances, the distance from the closest perimeter wall of the business establishment to
the perimeter of a defined off-site parking location shall not exceed 900 feet, except
that parking spaces dedicated for employee use may be at a greater distance.
2. Aesthetic and Pedestrian Considerations - If a business determines that site
aesthetics and pedestrian accessibility can be improved by the addition of malls,
walkways, landscaping, or similar site elements, or if adequate additional off-street
parking is provided, it may apply to the Commission for a special permit that would
allow for reduced on-site parking in favor of these design enhancements and the
substitution of additional parking spaces within a defined off-site parking location
approved by the Commission. In such instances, the distance from the closest
perimeter wall of the business establishment to the perimeter of the defined off-site
parking shall not exceed 900 feet, except that parking spaces dedicated for
employee use may be at a greater distance.

partially or wholly within one or more flood zones, the entire structure must comply with
the most stringent requirements of the zones involved.
1. Residential construction:
New construction and substantial improvements thereto shall be placed on a
permanent foundation and shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the BFE. This includes manufactured homes located
outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing park in which a
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood.
Recreational vehicles placed on sites within the areas of special flood hazard
shall either be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully
licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the elevation requirements listed
above and anchoring requirement of Section H (1). A recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no permanent
attached additions.
2. Nonresidential construction
New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or
other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to a level one foot above the BFE or, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
a. Be floodproofed from an elevation one foot above the BFE and below
so that the structure is watertight with walls and floors substantially
impermeable to the passage of water;
b. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects on buoyancy; and
c. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the
standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certificates shall be
provided to the official set forth in Subsection B(5)(b).
3. Floodways
a. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Subsection
B are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and
potential projectiles and erosion, the following provisions apply:
i. Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, are prohibited unless
certification, with supporting technical data, by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic

and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
practice that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet)
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
When utilizing data other than that provided by FEMA, the
Commission shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on
the principle that that area chosen for the regulatory floodway shall
be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing
the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any
one point.
ii. If Subsection I(3)(a)[i] is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of Subsection H, Provisions for Flood
Hazard Reduction.
iii. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles, (temporary or
permanent) are prohibited within all special flood hazard areas.

Special Permit Application established in Section 8 of these Regulations.
4. 100-Year Flood Districts
Where BFEs have been determined but before a floodway is designated, no new
construction, substantial improvement, or other improvement, including fill, shall
be permitted which could increase BFE more than one foot at any point along
the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively
with the proposed development.
J. Equal Conveyance, Compensatory Storage, and Associated Prohibitions
1. Equal Conveyance
Within the floodplain, except those areas that are tidally influenced, as
designated on the FIRM for the community, encroachment resulting from filling,
new construction, or substantial improvements involving an increased footprint of
the structure are specifically prohibited unless the applicant provided
certification from a registered engineer demonstrating, with supporting
hydrological and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet)
increase in flood levels (BFE). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to
the floodplain including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be
constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood
velocity.
2. Compensatory Storage

Enforcement
The water-holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas which are
tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new
construction, or substantial improvements involving an increased footprint to the
structure shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the
floodplain. Storage shall be provided on site unless easements have been
gained from adjacent property owners. It shall be provided within the same
hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage. It shall be
hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of
floodwater at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation,
which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory
volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway
or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off site if approved by
the Town of Brookfield.
5.6 Watershed Protection District (WPD)
A. Candlewood Lake Watershed District, (CLW)
1. Background
Candlewood Lake, the states largest lake and one of its most important inland
water resources, has experienced a gradual deterioration of water quality since
about 1950. Studies of the lake shoreline development area have recommended
planning to avoid the need to install a public sewer system.
Brookfield is one of five Connecticut towns that border the lake shore. The lakes
watershed area is 26,461 acres, and Brookfields portion is 1,177 acres or 4 percent
of the total. However, the watershed in Brookfield, especially the lake shore area,
is generally intensively developed and a primary source of stormwater runoff that
can carry nutrients and pollutants that contribute to the eutrophication of the lake
and deterioration of lake and groundwater quality.
These regulations are designed to minimize, and where possible reduce, the
negative impact of stormwater runoff affecting Candlewood Lake and the
watershed area, thereby reducing the rate of lake eutrophication and avoiding
the need for a public sewer system.
2. Purpose
The purpose of the Candlewood Lake Watershed District is to prevent nutrient
enrichment or contamination of Candlewood Lake and its watershed and to
avoid the need for sewers in this densely developed area of Brookfield.
Specifically, the purposes are:
a. To minimize the impervious surfaces and maximize infiltration of
stormwater runoff
2019-April-19
Article 5  Special Districts
114
Introduction Definitions Residential Commercial/
Industrial
Special
Districts Standards Miscellaneous Procedures Administration/
Enforcement
b. To reduce peak stormwater flow and minimize the likelihood of soil
erosion, stream channel instability, flooding, and habitat destruction
c. To preserve and/or create vegetative buffers of native plantings to
control and filter stormwater runoff
d. To minimize disturbance of natural grades and vegetation and utilize
existing topography for natural drainage systems
e. To contain stormwater runoff on the site wherever possible to reduce
the volume of stormwater runoff before it reaches the groundwater or
surface water bodies
f. To prevent and minimize potential groundwater pollution from improper
waste disposal, release of hazardous materials, and other sources
3. Land to which these regulations apply
These regulations apply to all land within the boundaries of the Candlewood Lake
watershed as delineated on a map on file in the offices of the Commission entitled
Candlewood Watershed District, Town of Brookfield.
4. Compliance
Within Town boundaries, the Candlewood Watershed District shall be
superimposed on existing zoning districts. The provisions of these regulations shall
be in addition to all other requirements of applicable statutes, codes, regulations,
or ordinances. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this Regulation
and any other Town regulation, the more restrictive requirement shall apply.
5. Permitted Uses
Permitted uses are all uses permitted in the underlying districts except those cited
in Section 5.4D(2).
6. Required Stormwater Management Plan and Data
All new building construction, or an addition, alteration, or enlargement that results
in an increase in the amount of impervious surface (paved drives, walks, patios,
etc.) on a lot where the total impervious surface is ten percent or greater, shall
require a Stormwater Management Plan. In addition to the data required
elsewhere in these Regulations, the following data shall be required:
a. A narrative report prepared by a licensed engineer indicating:
? Any risk or threat to Candlewood Lake or the water resources in its
watershed from site development, site improvements, or on-site
operations proposed in the application and measures
2019-April-19

? Methods of assessment and best management practices to prevent
and reduce any such risk or threat
? Supporting documentation, including calculations and engineering
details, shall be provided to illustrate the existing and proposed
developments compliance with these Regulations, which
development shall be designed in accordance with the stormwater
management design guidelines of the Connecticut Stormwater
Quality Manual of 2004, as revised.
b. A site plan indicating
? All relevant data required under Section 5.4(F)
? Location and area of all impervious surfaces on the site
? Location and area of turf cover (lawn areas)
? Location and area of all existing woodland areas
? Location and area of all existing and proposed vegetative buffer
areas
? Location and description of all potential runoff and pollution sources
including erosive soils and steep slopes
? Location and specification of all existing and proposed stormwater
best management practices
7. Best Management Practices
The following practices and methods shall be incorporated into all Stormwater
Management Plans where practicable:
? Vegetated swales, buffers, filter strips
? Level spreaders
? Grassed drainage swales, wet or dry
? Maintain or restore predevelopment vegetation
? Minimize creation of steep slopes
? Bioretention structures/residential rain gardens
? Rainwater harvesting/rain barrels
? Dry detention ponds
? Underground detention ponds
? Proper location and reduction of impervious surface area on site
? Disconnect flows from multiple impervious surfaces
? Permeable pavement choices
? Groundwater infiltration systems (curtain drains, drywells, galleries, etc.)
8. Approval Considerations
a. Prior to the issuance of Zoning Approval or Certificate of Zoning
Compliance, the Commission, acting through its authorized agent, the
Zoning Enforcement Officer, shall give consideration to the simplicity,

prepared for the site.
b. The Commission, or its agent, may solicit the opinion of the Health
Department, Town Engineer, Inland Wetlands Commission, and the
Planning Commission concerning any application involving the
Candlewood Lake Watershed District.
c. Approval shall not be granted until the Zoning Enforcement Officer
determines that the proposed plan will employ best management
practices to substantially reduce and improve the on-site cleansing of
stormwater runoff from the site.

designated time periods and then add the resulting sums from each
vertical column. The column total having the highest total value is the
minimum shared parking space requirement for that combination of
land use.
c. The Zoning Commission may permit the construction of some portion of the
required parking spaces to be deferred when it finds that the full number of
spaces are not required immediately. However, construction of stormwater
management systems designed to accommodate the entire parking area shall
not be deferred. The Zoning Enforcement Officer, in consultation with the
Zoning Commission, may require the installation of the deferred parking spaces
at any time if he determines that the constructed parking is insufficient for the
use.
d. The Zoning Commission may permit two or more parcels of land to enter into
a shared parking agreement to satisfy the parking requirements per tables 6.2
and 6.3, based on additional study of parking generation of proposed and
existing land uses on the parcels. The parcels shall be located within 500 feet of
one another and there shall be safe pedestrian access provided between the
parcels, and proposed and existing uses. The shared parking agreement shall
be in a form acceptable to the Town Attorney and shall be recorded in the
Land Records.

expected to queue. A minimum queuing area shall accommodate two
vehicles unless otherwise specified in these Regulations.
b. Points of access shall align with opposing streets and driveways unless there is
a specific site or safety condition that precludes such alignment.
c. The width of an access drive from the street shall be a minimum of 12 feet for
one-way traffic and shall not exceed 24 feet for two-way traffic except in
instances where there is a landscaped median or in instances where the width
is controlled by a permit issued by the Connecticut DOT.
d. Except for single-family dwellings, traffic controls and pavement markings
shall be installed and maintained as determined by the Local Traffic Authority
and shall conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).
2. In order to reduce existing and potential traffic congestion and safety issues on the
Federal Road corridor, the following standards shall apply to any project or
development with frontage or access onto any portion of Federal Road. In addition
to the standards and regulations described below, applicants should familiarize
themselves with the requirements set forth by the Connecticut Office of the State
Traffic Administration (OSTA) with respect to new traffic control devices, modifications
to existing traffic control devices, and certification of major traffic generators
(pursuant to CGS §14-311).
a. Vehicle access to a property and circulation thereon shall be arranged in
such a manner so as to safeguard against hazards to traffic, property and
pedestrians, to avoid congestion on any street and to provide safe and
convenient circulation in the street and upon the property.

b. Where reasonable alternate access is available, the vehicular access to the
lot shall be arranged to avoid traffic use of local residential streets situated in or
bordered by residential districts.
c. Where a property has frontage on two or more streets, the access to the
property shall be provided to the property across the frontage and to the street
where there is lesser potential for traffic congestion and for hazards to traffic
and pedestrians.
d. The street giving access to the property shall have traffic-carrying capacity
and be suitably improved to accommodate the amount and types of traffic
generated by the proposed use.
e. Where necessary to safeguard against hazards to traffic and pedestrians
and/or to avoid traffic congestion, provision shall be made for turning lanes,
traffic directional islands, frontage roads, driveways and traffic controls within
the streets.
f. Access driveways shall be of a design and have sufficient capacity to avoid
queuing of entering vehicles on any street.
g. Commercial and industrial entrance driveways shall be a minimum of two 12-
foot-wide lanes in each direction of travel. For driveways entering into a town
road, the width of the driveway flare at the edge of the roadway where the
driveway intersects the roadway shall be a maximum of 30 feet for residential
drives and 50 feet for commercial/industrial drives unless the Commission
determines that a wider width of driveway flare will facilitate traffic flow and/or
is required for overriding considerations of safety. Driveways entering into state
highways are under the jurisdiction of the state DOT and/or OSTA.
h. It is the intent of the Commission to minimize the number of curb cuts and
access points along all state highways and Town roads. Provision shall be
made for circulation driveway connections to adjoining properties of similar
existing or potential use whenever possible, based on physical conditions and
ownership agreements.
i. Existing traffic, access management, and safety plans and studies adopted
by the Western Connecticut Council of Governments, its predecessor entities,
and the Connecticut DOT shall be considered in the development of traffic
mitigation measures relating to any development adjacent to Federal Road.
To the extent practicable, improvements and mitigation measures shall
implement or complement previously planned improvements.
j. There shall be no more than one driveway connection from any property to
any street, except that separate entrance and exit driveways may be provided
where necessary to safeguard against hazard, provide access for emergency

vehicles, and to avoid congestion. Additional driveway connections may be
provided particularly for but not limited to large tracts and uses of extensive
scope if traffic flow in the street will be facilitated by the additional connection.
Driveways shall not exceed 30 feet in width at the street line or such lesser width
as will be sufficient to accommodate the traffic to be generated unless a
greater width is required by the Town Road Ordinance.
k. Where it is projected that the additional traffic resulting from the project will
reduce the level of service to D or below, the Commission shall not approve the
project unless and until provision has been made for the improvement of said
condition. In all traffic analysis reports, use of a volume/capacity ratio of 1.00 to
represent either level of Service C or E is acceptable as long as the selected
base is used consistently and clearly indicated.
D. Traffic Impact Analysis
The Commission shall require a traffic impact analysis as part of any application for a
multifamily dwelling project of 20 or more units or any other project containing either 50 or
more parking spaces in a new or expanded parking lot or generating 100 or more vehicle
trips a day.
1. Such analysis shall include, at least, the following information:
a. Existing and projected traffic volumes (average daily traffic, peak a.m. and
p.m.) and peak-hour traffic generation
b. Past and present roadway conditions including location and number of
accidents
c. Existing roadway capacity and volume and capacity ratios
d. Proposed sight lines
e. Location of existing and proposed curb cuts, traffic lights, and intersections
at the development site and within 300 feet from the development site
f. Traffic impact of proposed development, including but not limited to the
effect of the proposed development on traffic conditions on abutting streets
and any nearby intersections that would have 100 or more vehicle trips in a
peak hour
g. The patterns of vehicular circulation in relation to the adjoining street system
h. Adequacy of:
i. Right-of-way and travel way
ii. Traffic signalization, traffic channelization, left-turn lanes, and roadway
widths of adjoining streets

of the Connecticut DOT, the Brookfield Police Commission, and the
Commissions engineer
k. Whether a significant traffic impact will occur as identified under subsection
(2) below
2. In evaluating whether the projected impacts of a proposed project are significant,
the Commission shall consider the following factors:
a. The effect of traffic conditions on abutting streets and nearby intersections
that would have 100 or more peak-hour vehicle trips
b. The adequacy of traffic signalization, channelization and turn lanes,
roadway width, length of queues, traffic drop-off areas, and other
transportation facilities
c. A reduction of the peak-hour level of service at an intersection below Level
D (or a further degradation of the level of service if the intersection is already at
or below service D). The Commission may also take into consideration the
incremental degradation of service within a particular level of service.

6.2 Signage
A. Purposes
The provisions of this section have been adopted to achieve the following purposes:
1. To preserve property values by preventing unsightly and detrimental development
which has a blighting influence upon residential, business, and industrial uses of land.
2. To ensure signs may perform their important functions of identifying and advertising
businesses, while preventing signs from reaching such excessive size that they obscure
one another to the detriment of adjacent businesses.
3. To promote the maintenance and development of an attractive visual environment
and maintain the aesthetic and historic character of the Town of Brookfield and
prevent the blighting influence of large signs.
4. To prohibit billboards, defined as signs that promote an activity, business, or product
that is unrelated to the site on which it is located, and to prevent the blighting
influence of large signs.
5. To foster public safety on streets by assuring that all signs are located and designed
in a safe and appropriate manner that prevents the creation of traffic distractions and
hazards.
6. Notwithstanding any element of this statement of purposes or any other subsection
of these Regulations, any authorized sign may contain non-commercial copy in lieu of
any other copy, so long as the other provisions of these Regulations are complied with,
it not being the intent of these Regulations to regulate sign content.
B. Severability
1. Should a court of law deem any portion of these Regulations, their subparts, or
referring regulations to be Constitutionally infirm, said court may strike or sever such
portion it deems inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States of America or
the Constitution of the State of Connecticut and leave the unoffending portions of
these Regulations intact.
C. Permits
1. Application for a sign permit shall be on an appropriate form provided by the
Zoning Commission, in accordance with the requirements of Appendix 1.
2. The fees associated with a Sign Permit shall be in accordance with the Zoning
Commission Fee Schedule (Appendix 3).
3. No sign shall be installed, enlarged, or relocated unless it conforms to the provisions
of this regulation and a permit has been secured.
4. Permits shall be issued by the ZEO, in accordance with the Zoning Permit procedures
established in Section 8.2 of these regulations.

Enforcement
5. Permits are valid only during the time the business is in operation. Signs and all sign
material shall be removed within ten days after the business ceases to be operational.
The period shall begin on the day following the last day the business is open.
D. Prohibited Signs
The signs or sign devices are expressly prohibited:
1. Streamers, banners, inflatables, flag-like, or other sign devices not herein defined,
unless specifically authorized for grand opening events
2. Flashing, rotating, moving, or blinking signs, or optically projected slide signals which
are changed periodically. This provision shall not be construed to prohibit clocks or
time and temperature signs that have been approved by the Commission.
3. Signs illuminated by flashing, rotating, moving, or blinking sources of light, or signs
having an exposed source of illumination.
4. Signs that are illuminated in a manner or with such intensity or brightness that they
may tend to cause glare, distraction, or nuisance to operators of vehicles, pedestrians,
or neighboring property owners and/or occupants.
5. Signs including structural elements that obstruct any window, door, fire escape,
stairway, or opening intended to provide light, air, ingress, or egress from any building
or structure.
E. General Provisions
1. Construction: All signs shall be constructed of strong material which will not warp or
contort with weather or age, firmly supported so as to withstand wind conditions
normally expected throughout the year, and kept freshly painted or otherwise
maintained in good condition and repair.
2. Design and Appearance: All signs shall be compatible in scale, design, color, and
construction with the architectural character of the building(s) or premises to which
they refer and with the neighborhood within which they are located.
a. The structure portions of signs (columns, cross-beams, braces, etc.) shall be
proportional to the sign panel they are supporting.
b. Freestanding signs shall meet the ground in an attractive manner. The use of
appropriate plantings with year-round attractiveness, mulched with a fine stone
aggregate or bark surface treatment, shall be required in conjunction with the
approval of a new sign if necessary for compliance with this section.
c. The following guidelines should be considered in the design of signs to
maximize their function as a communication tool:
2019-April-19
Article 6  General Standards
131
Introduction Definitions Residential Commercial/
Industrial
Special
Districts Standards Miscellaneous Procedures Administration/
Enforcement
i. Simple fonts and use of a combination of upper and lower-case
lettering (compared to all upper-case lettering) are encouraged to
promote legibility.
ii. Open or negative space surrounding lines of type of graphic elements
should be greater than the copy space for multiple lines of copy.
iii. Signs employing light-colored copy on a contrasting, darker-colored
background is encouraged to enhance sign visibility, as white or lightcolored
backgrounds may be more difficult to read due to the
competing nature of environmental light sources.
iv. A well-defined edge or border to a sign enhances its visibility.
3. Window Signs
Window signs shall not exceed 25% of the total window area for each business,
viewable from a public street or from a parking area, provided no such window sign
shall be located or maintained so as to be a hazard to traffic or pedestrians, to
obstruct any door, ventilation system or cause any other hazard to public health or
safety.
4. Location
a. No sign shall be located closer than 35 feet from the center of the traveled
portion of the road, or closer than 10 feet from the edge of pavement of the
road, in any zone, except names and addresses attached to mailboxes. No
sign location shall obstruct any line of sight. Where a paved or traveled portion
of any street is widened and the sign obstructs the new lines of sight, it shall be
set further back to conform to the requirements.
b. No sign shall be arranged so that it blocks reasonable sight lines for streets,
walks, or driveways. No sign should be confused with a traffic control device by
reason of the sign's color, location, shape, and/or other characteristics or
through any other means. Glare from the sign shall not interfere with traffic.
c. All permitted signs must be located on the same lot as the building or use to
which said signs apply.
d. No sign may be attached to a tree.
5. Wording: Descriptive wording may be changed without a permit provided that the
area dedicated to changing descriptive wording, commonly called reader boards,
shall not exceed 50 percent of the total sign area and that the coloration and
composition of the text are compatible with the remainder of the sign.
6. Dimensional Standards
2019-April-19
Article 6  General Standards
132
Introduction Definitions Residential Commercial/
Industrial
Special
Districts Standards Miscellaneous Procedures Administration/
Enforcement
a. The area of a sign shall be considered to be that of the smallest rectangle,
triangle, or circle which encompasses all lettering, wording, design, or symbols.
If attached to or located on the building, the area of the sign shall include any
background different from the balance of the wall if such background is
designed as an integral part of, and obviously related to, the sign. When the
lettering is placed on a building, the area of the sign shall be computed as the
area of the smallest quadrilateral capable of including all lettering or other
items comprising the sign.
b. Building signs shall be limited in total square footage to the amount of linear
building frontage facing each street, main access drive, or interior
courtyard/pedestrian mall. In multioccupant buildings, the allowable signage
facing each street, main access drive, or interior courtyard/pedestrian mall
shall be proportionally divided according to the percentage of the linear
building frontage attributable to each occupant on that street, main access
drive, or interior courtyard/pedestrian mall, or such other method as may be
approved by the Commission in unique or unusual circumstances.
c. Roadside signs are to be limited to one per building, or three commercial
buildings in a group with a maximum size of 50 square feet. If there is more than
one establishment, the sign may contain the name of all occupants with each
name appearing on a panel. If the establishment is a retail service station, an
additional sign or signs denoting prices of fuel only, not to exceed 24 square
feet, may be located on the trademark sign stanchion.
d. Where a double-facing sign is allowed, the maximum permitted sign area
shall apply to each face. All framing shall be included in computing the sign
area. Where the sign is not contained within the outer dimension of a frame,
then the area of the sign shall be computed as the area of the smallest
quadrilateral encompassing all lettering and other items comprising the signs.
Legs, posts, pedestals, or monuments supporting the sign and below the sign
quadrilateral shall not be considered in computing the maximum area of the
sign.
e. If a permitted sign is independent of a building, the top of said sign or
support shall be not higher than 18 feet above mean ground level in the
immediate area in which the sign is located. If the sign is mounted on a
monument or pedestal-type base that is more than one foot wide, the height
of the monument type or pedestal base shall not exceed five feet above mean
ground level. Support legs or posts shall not exceed 12 inches in diameter or
width.
f. A sign supported by a wall shall not be set out more than 12 inches from said
wall and shall not project above the roofline or beyond the side of said wall.
g. No building sign shall extend above the roofline or parapet wall.

7. Illumination
a. Animation, flashing, moving, or festoon lights or any audio advertising
devices shall not be permitted.
b. Where a building fronts on two streets, each frontage is to be considered
individually, with the limitations applied as for two separate units.
c. Illuminated signs may be permitted by the ZEO, subject to the following
regulations:
i. A drawing showing the general appearance of the proposed
illuminated sign from each street from which such sign may be visible
shall be provided to the ZEO.
ii. A plot plan showing the location of the proposed illuminated sign in
relation to existing buildings on the same lot and on all adjacent lots,
including lots which would be adjacent but for the existence of a street,
shall be provided to the ZEO. The names of the owners of such lots shall
be clearly shown thereon.
iii. Internally illuminated or back-lit signs shall not exceed 225 lumens of
luminous flux for every square foot of signage. Data sheets must be
provided with application.
iv. Lighting fixtures illuminating signs shall be carefully located, aimed,
and shielded so that light is directed only onto the sign façade. Light
shall not be aimed toward adjacent streets, roads, or properties, nor shall
the light source be visible from any public right-of-way or from outside of
the lot lines.
v. No LEDs or new internally illuminated signs shall be permitted in the
TCD or any residential zone.
vi. Externally mounted light fixtures shall be mounted on the top of the
sign structure and aimed downward unless it can be demonstrated that
alternative designs will not result in light spillover.
vii. All ground-mounted fixtures shall be screened by bushes or other
appropriate means; all fixtures mounted on the sign itself shall blend in
with the background color of the sign or its surroundings as deemed
appropriate for the site.
viii. Energy-saving and solar lighting are encouraged.
ix. Halo-lit signs may be approved by the ZEO provided that white light
only shall be used, and light intensity shall be subtle and create a low

intensity light wash on the sign board or background surface. Colored
lighting is not permitted.
x. The ZEO may approve a reduced-size sign if halo lighting is requested.
xi. Internally illuminated signs existing at the date of adoption of these
Regulations may remain and may have minor modifications to reflect
changing business names, but more significant changes in location, size,
or structure shall require compliance with these Regulations.
xii. The ZEO may require readjustment or relocation of a sign in order to
prevent glare and to ensure vehicular and pedestrian safety.
8. Sign Types by Zone Categories:
Signs shall be permitted in accordance with Table 6.4, in which the maximum area per
sign is listed as square feet (SF).

6.3 Landscaping
A. Purpose, Applicability, and Design Principles
1. Purpose: These landscaping requirements are adopted for the purpose of
protecting property values by:
a. Preserving existing vegetation, planting of new materials, and use of
planters and similar landscape devices that enhance the environmental
quality and visual appearance of sites, buildings, and parking
b. Providing buffers between land uses that enhance privacy and
minimize the intrusion of light, dust, and noise
c. Preventing the erosion of soil
d. Improving water quality through the reduction of sedimentation and
promotion of runoff infiltration
e. Improving the environmental quality and aesthetic quality of the Town
of Brookfield
2. Applicability: These regulations shall apply to any proposed use or
development activity that requires Site Plan or Special Permit approval.
Additionally, the requirements contained in Section 6.3(B) shall apply to any
application requiring subdivision approval. The Commission may approve
alternate landscape treatments consistent with the purpose and intent of these
standards.
3. Design Principles: to the greatest extent practicable, landscape design and
specific treatments shall:
a. Preserve the existing landscape in its natural state with respect to trees
and vegetation, grade changes, and existing landscape features such as
stone walls.
b. Use natural, planted slopes rather than retaining walls.
c. Retain existing healthy, mature trees and provide protection during
construction.
d. Use native species or cultivars of native species for the majority of the
planted area that can survive on the natural rainfall cycle and require
minimal or no fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides.
e. Incorporate stormwater management systems into the overall
landscape plan for the site, including rain gardens, depressed planting
islands, permeable pavers, and ponds.

4. Landscape Plan: compliance with all requirements of this Section shall be
demonstrated and all plantings and proposed landscape architectural features
indicated, on a landscape plan of at least the same scale as the required site
plan. Such plan shall include a plant list with plant names, size at planting, and
size when mature. It shall also provide planting instructions conforming to good
horticultural practice. The plan shall be prepared by a licensed landscape
architect.
B. General Landscaping Standards
1. To the extent practicable, the existing landscape shall be preserved in its
natural state. Existing mature vegetation shall be maintained insofar as practical
and may be credited toward meeting landscape requirements with the
approval of the Board or Commission.
2. Where existing large trees have been removed prior to the submission of an
application, the installation of additional landscape materials to preplace the
removed trees may be required. The number, size, quality of the vegetation,
amount of lost shade, and similar factors shall be considered when determining
the amount of additional landscape materials to be installed.
3. Steep Slopes
a. Any slope in excess of 20 percent (1:5) shall be considered a steep
slope.
b. Steep slopes and other areas subject to erosion shall require
improvements and appropriate landscape treatments to ensure the
stability of soils and viability of planted materials. Steep slopes shall be
planted with shrubbery or ground cover. Riprap and other nonvegetative
material may be allowed at the Commissions discretion.
c. No slope extending over 100 feet in length measured in any direction
across the contours of a lot may be created with a grade that exceeds 33
percent on average. All site plans shall identify any existing slopes that
exceed this criteria.
4. A variety of plant species shall be integrated into a landscaping plan, and the
use of monocultures shall be avoided.
5. The use of invasive plant species, as identified by the Connecticut Invasive
Plant Council, is prohibited (see https://cipwg.uconn.edu).

6.11 Architectural Guidelines
A. Purpose and Intent
It is the purpose of this section to provide general guidelines on the design of
buildings and structures with the objective of promoting development projects
that preserve and improve the appearance, beauty and character of the
community.
It is the goal of the Commission to foster economic development by
encouraging the harmonization of design and appearance across Brookfields
commercial districts and to create welcoming and attractive gateways to the
Town Center District.
It is also the goal of the Commission to minimize the impacts of the Towns
commercial uses on adjoining residential areas; thereby protecting the property
values of both adjoining commercial properties as well as adjoining residential
zones.
B. Background
During the preparation of the Plan of Conservation and Development in 2000,
surveys and considerable public comment indicated a high degree of
dissatisfaction with the physical appearance of many structures within the Towns
Commercial and Industrial zoning districts. The public consensus was that
building design should follow traditional New England architectural design and
style concepts, and that modern, monolithic structures were not compatible with
the desire for more historic architectural themes. This consensus was reaffirmed
in subsequent plans, studies, including the Four Corners Revitalization Plan
prepared in 2012, the establishment of the Brookfield Design Review Team in
2013, and the 2015 update of the Plan of Conservation and Development. This
consensus is consistent with the stated zoning purpose of protecting and
conserving the character of the town.
C. Applicability and Procedure
Any Site Plan or Special Permit application for a non-residential or mixed-use
structure proposed in any zoning district shall conform to the architectural
guidelines set forth in Section 6.11(D - F) below, except if such use is proposed
within the Town Center District. Uses or structures proposed in the Town Center
District shall instead conform to the standards, guidelines, and procedures of the
TCD Design Guideline, presented in Appendix 2 of these Regulations.
1. The Zoning Commission shall make a determination of whether the design of
any use or structure(s) conforms with these standards.
2. In the case of any proposed use or structure to be located outside of the Town
Center District, the Land Use Department professional staff and/or its designee
shall evaluate the applications general conformance with the architectural

guidelines and standards set forth below. The Zoning Commission may refer to
such evaluation in its decision making regarding the application.
3. In the case of a proposed use or structure to be located within the Town
Center District, the Design Review Team shall consider the proposed
development and make recommendations relative to the conformance of the
proposed site plan with the TCD Design Guidelines and Standards Manual, in
accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 3.0 of that document.
4. In the case of a proposed use or structure to be located in a Commercial or
Industrial zone (including the C-1, C-2, C-GS, C-GN, I-1, CP or MC districts) the
applicant shall schedule a pre-application meeting.
a. Land Use Department professional staff and/or its designee will meet
with the applicant to discuss the incorporation of the guidelines and
standards set forth below. Land Use Department staff will keep notes of
the discussion and prepare a summary of the meeting outcomes.
b. Land Use Department staff and/or its designee will submit the summary
of meeting outcomes from its pre-application review meeting with the
Applicant, and its recommendations relative to the proposed
development to the Zoning Commission. Such recommendations are
advisory in nature only. The Applicant should make any adjustments he or
she deems appropriate to the proposed site plan based on the feedback
from the pre-application review meeting in advance of formal submittal
to the Zoning Commission.
c. The Zoning Commission will refer to the advisory recommendations of
Land Use Department Staff and/or designee in its decision making
regarding the application.
D. I-1 and CP Design Standards
The following standards are applicable to Site Plan and Special Permit applications in
the I-1 and CP districts.

Article 9  Administration and Enforcement
A. Enforcement
In accordance with the Connecticut General Statutes, the Commission is solely
responsible for enforcement of the Zoning Regulations. In carrying out these
responsibilities, the Commission may employ, but shall not be limited to, use of the
following techniques:
? Promulgation of required applications forms and appropriate check-lists.
? Review and approval of appropriate permits and certificates, including stipulations
or conditions thereupon.
? On-site inspections.
? Investigation of complaints.
? Issuance of: letters of warning, requests for corrective action, summons for
appearance before the Commission, Cease and Desist Orders.
? Revocation of permits or approval actions.
? Appropriate legal proceedings.
? Such other techniques as may be authorized by law, regulation, ordinance or
statute.
B. Designation of Enforcement Agent(s)
The Commission may delegate specific administrative and enforcement activities to one
or more of its membership and to the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO), an individual
acting as an agent of the Commission. The ZEO so delegated, shall have such
credentials as the Commission, in its sole determination, shall deem appropriate and shall
otherwise be acceptable to the Commission. The Commission shall present any such
candidate(s) to the cognizant authority for appointment as required by Town Charter.
C. Enforcement Actions
The main purpose of an enforcement action is the elimination of a violation. Upon verbal
or written complaint and/or inspection, the ZEO shall determine if a violation of the
regulations has indeed occurred. If the ZEO determines that a violation has occurred, the
ZEO is empowered to immediately take action to cure the violation. Priority action shall
be taken in situations where there are overriding concerns of health and safety or where,
unless immediate action is taken to halt an activity, an irreversible event may occur
which is not in accordance with generally accepted zoning or good environmental
practice. The ZEO shall maintain a chronological record of all complaints and
subsequent enforcement action and shall prepare summary violation reports for
Commission meetings.
1. Issuance of an order
When the ZEO has determined that a violation exists, he/she shall issue a written
order to the responsible party to:

Districts Standards Miscellaneous Procedures Administration/
Enforcement
a. cease and desist in all illegal activity,
b. perform corrective action to comply with the regulation.
2. Compliance/Show Cause Hearing/Appeal
After receiving an order, the individual receiving the order may either:
a. comply with the order, or
b. schedule an informal hearing before the Commission at the next
regularly scheduled meeting to show cause why a CITATION should not
be issued. If the action of the ZEO is upheld by the commission, the
individual in violation shall promptly comply with the compliance order.
3. Issuance of a citation
If an Order is not complied with within the prescribed time period, the Commission
may direct the ZEO to issue a citation and impose such fines as are provided for by
Town Ordinance (Zoning Violation Penalty Ordinance). The ZEO may NOT initiate
this action without the prior consent and direction of the Zoning Commission. The
Commission shall insure that the file of the violation is current, accurate and
complete prior to directing this action by the ZEO. If the violation continues
unabated, despite timely payment of fines, a subsequent Citation or Citations may
be issued. Any person who has received a Cease and Desist Order within ten (10)
days after receipt of the Order, schedule an informal hearing before the Zoning
Commission to show cause why a CITATION should not be issued.
4. Notice of citation
After the expiration of the ten day period, but within one year, as stated in the
Citation, the ZEO shall send a notice which restates the rights and appeal period,
all of which are cited in the Citation itself.
5. Payment of Fines
Payment of fines normally closes the Citation matter.
a. If the Respondent fails to pay or file an appeal within the required time
frame the following action shall be taken:
i. The ZEO shall certify that:
? The Respondent has failed to pay the fine or file an appeal;
? That as a consequence of the failure to respond, the
Respondent is deemed to have admitted liability for the
violation(s) pursuant to CGS §7-152c(d);

Numbers shall be determined by the foot frontage:
Map Number 3C24, entitled "Brookfield, Connecticut, Street
Numbering Sequence Map," filed at the office of the Town Clerk, shall
be employed as the basis for establishing number flow of all existing
and future streets.
A.
Route 25 from the Newtown Town line north to its junction with Route 7
and then north on Route 7 to the New Milford Town line shall constitute
the base line for numbering.
B.
Numbering shall be consecutive, with even numbers on the north and
west side and odd numbers on the south and east side of the streets.
In the case of a curvilinear street, the odd and even numbers shall be
determined by the direction of the major portion of the street.
C.
Numbering shall start at the base line and emanate east and west from
this line for all east/west oriented streets. North/south oriented streets
shall be numbered starting at the southernmost portion. An exception
would be when a street ends in a cul-de-sac, in which case the number
shall start at the head of the street or where it initially junctions with
another street.
D.
Corner lots at intersections shall be assigned a number on each street.
Those lots with a structure shall use the number assigned on the street
facing the main entrance.
E.
For commercial and industrial zones, all numbers shall be assigned
on the basis of one number per each 50 feet, except where existing
structures dictate the necessity of numbering to be on a greater or
lesser footage.
A.
For residential zones, all numbers shall be assigned on the basis of
one number per 150 feet, except where existing lot sizes dictate the
necessity of numbering to be on a greater or lesser footage.

§ 99-3. Shopping centers.
Shopping centers shall be assigned one number for the total complex. This
number shall be determined by the location of the main entrance to the
complex. If this cannot be readily determined, then that number which
corresponds with the approximate center of the structure shall be assigned.
§ 99-4. Professional buildings.
Professional buildings shall be assigned one number per building. This
number shall be determined by location of the main entrance to the building
with respect to the street-numbering sequence.
§ 99-5. Apartment and condominium complexes.
Apartment and condominium complexes shall have their own distinct
identification or street name and shall be numbered consecutively.
§ 99-6. Display of numbers.
§ 99-7. Responsibility for procuring numbers.
Whenever any house, building or structure is erected, in order to preserve
the continuity and uniformity of numbering, it shall be the responsibility of
the owner or agent to procure the correct number or numbers as designated
on the Assessor's maps and/or field cards for the said property and
immediately fasten the said number or numbers so assigned as provided
in § 99-6C of this chapter. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall assign
numbers when none appear on the Assessor's map or on the field cards.
When street numbering has been completed, the owner, occupant or
agent shall place or cause to be placed upon each house or building
controlled by him the number or numbers assigned.
A.
Such number or numbers shall be placed on existing buildings within
30 days. The cost of the numbers shall be paid for by the property
owner. The numbers used shall not be less than three inches in height
and shall be made of a durable and clearly visible material. Failure to
install the proper number or numbers on existing buildings on or before
the thirty-day limit provided herein will subject violators to a fine of
$25.
B.
The number shall be conspicuously placed above, on or at the side of
the proper door of each building, so that the number can be seen plainly
from the street line. Whenever a building is set more than 75 feet from
the street line, the number shall be placed near the walk, drive way or
common entrance to such building and upon a gate post, fence, post or
other appropriate place so as to be discernible easily from the street
line.

Assessment of Benefits for Sidewalk Improvements
[Adopted by the Board of Selectmen 5-2-2016]
§ 192-38. Assessments authorized.
At any time after the Town of Brookfield, by Town Meeting, zoning authority
approval, or by the Board of Selectmen, resolves to or approves the layout
or construction of sidewalks, curbs, other improvements and associated
amenities (hereinafter "improvements") in the Town Center District as
shown on the Town of Brookfield Zoning Map, the Board of Selectmen may
levy benefit assessments upon the lands and buildings in the municipality
which, in its judgment, are especially benefited by the improvements, and
upon the owners of such land and buildings, according to such resolution as
the Board of Selectmen may adopt, subject to any right of appeal allowed
by law and subject to any exemptions mandated by law.
§ 192-39. Determination of cost of improvements.
The Board of Selectmen shall ascertain the cost of the improvements and,
in ascertaining the cost, shall take into account all costs of construction,
including, but not limited to, the cost of construction, land acquisition, cost
connected with financing the project, all engineering and legal expenses
related to the project and any other costs or expenses needed to complete
the improvements.
§ 192-40. Criteria for determination of assessment.
Upon determining the amount to be collected pursuant to the assessment,
which amount may be a fraction of, but shall not exceed 50% of, the cost of
the improvements as determined in § 192-39, the Board of Selectmen shall
assess the benefits upon the properties the Board of Selectmen determines
are benefited by the improvements in proportion to the square footage/area
of the improvements fronting or bounding the properties to be assessed.
The Board of Selectmen may make reasonable allowances whenever, for any
reason, the particular situation of any property requires an allowance (e.g.,
a corner lot).
§ 192-41. Use of Tax Assessor maps for measurements.
For the purposes of any measurements required under these ordinances,
the maps of the Tax Assessor of the Town of Brookfield shall be deemed
applicable and accurate unless shown to be otherwise by a Class A-2 survey
certified by a registered Connecticut land surveyor.
§ 192-42. Authority of Board of Selectmen to provide for
installment payments.
The Board of Selectmen may, by resolution, provide for an installment
method of payment of any assessment levied hereunder, including the
§ 192-38 OPEN SPACE USE § 192-42
164:55
number and duration of payments and the interest rate to be charged.
The interest rate shall not exceed the rate of interest the municipality is
obligated to pay to finance the project or the prime rate of interest plus 1%
if the project is not financed.
§ 192-43. Benefit assessment enactment procedure.
§ 192-44. Delinquent assessments.
The Board of Selectmen shall fix in the Assessment of Benefits
Resolution the due date of assessments made and the manner in which
the assessment shall be paid, whether in full or by installment, pursuant
to § 192-42.
A.
No assessment shall be made until after a public hearing has been held
before the Board of Selectmen at which the owners of all property to
be assessed shall have had an opportunity to be heard concerning the
proposed assessment. Notice of the time, place and purpose of such
hearing shall be published at least seven days before the date thereof
in a newspaper having a general circulation in the Town, and a notice
signed by the Town Clerk shall be mailed to each owner of record of any
property to be assessed at such owner's address as shown in the latest
completed Grand List. A copy of the proposed Assessment of Benefits
Resolution shall be on file in the office of the Town Clerk and available
for inspection by the public at least seven days prior to the date of the
public hearing.
B.
When the Board of Selectmen has finally determined the amount of
the assessment to be levied, the final resolution shall state the street
address of the properties to be assessed, the names and addresses
of the affected property owners, and the specific assessment amount
assessed against each individual property. The final resolution of the
Board of Selectmen shall be filed in the offices of the Tax Assessor,
Tax Collector and the Town Clerk, and the Town Clerk shall cause the
resolution to be published in a newspaper having a general circulation
in the Town within 14 days after it is filed with the Town Clerk.
C.
Any assessment of benefits or any installment thereof not paid within
30 days after the due date shall be delinquent and shall be subject to
interest from such due date at the set interest rate. Such interest and
costs shall be collectible as part of such assessment.
A.
Any unpaid assessment and any interest due thereon shall constitute
a lien upon the real estate against which the assessment was levied
from the date of such assessment payment due date. Each such lien
may be continued, recorded and released in the manner provided by
the General Statutes for continuing, recording and releasing real estate
tax liens. Each such lien shall take precedence over all other liens
and encumbrances except taxes and may be foreclosed in the same
manner as for real estate tax liens. The Tax Collector of the municipality
shall collect such assessments, interest and costs in accordance with all
B.
§ 192-42 BROOKFIELD CODE § 192-44
164:56
provisions of the General Statutes for the collection of real estate taxes,
and the Town may recover any such assessment, interest and costs in
