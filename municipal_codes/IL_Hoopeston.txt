persons have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct that affects individuals of all
genders and sexual orientations. It is a city policy to prohibit harassment
of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee
or municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal
officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof. 



(Ord. 2018-11, § 1 (part), 2018)



2.78.020  Definition of sexual harassment. 



   A.   This chapter adopts the definition of sexual harassment as
stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, ILCS 775, Act 5, §§ 1-101 et seq.,
which currently defines sexual harassment as:



      1.   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual
favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when:



         a.   Submission to such conduct is made either
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;



         b.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an
individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting that
individual; or



         c.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of
substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating
an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.



      2.   Conduct that may constitute sexual harassment includes:



         a.   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments,
insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy- or gender-specific traits,
sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements
about other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature;



         b.   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds
(whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures,
“catcalls”, “smacking” or “kissing” noises;



         c.   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a
sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or websites;



         d.   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault;



         e.   Textual/electronic: “sexting” (electronically
sending messages with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use
of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all
forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages,
intranet/online postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites
like Facebook and Twitter).



   B.   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier
to determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is
more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of
what would offend a “reasonable person”. 



(Ord. 2018-11, § 1 (part), 2018)



2.78.030  Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment. 



   A.   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating
her/his position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor.
It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making
the report.



   B.   Any employee may report conduct believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:



      1.   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual
harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly
and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and
request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal.
If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or
a memo.



      2.   Contact with supervisory personnel.



         a.   At the same time direct communication is
undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by
the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the immediate
supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a director of
human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or administrator, or the
chief executive officer of the municipality.



         b.   The employee experiencing what he or she believes
to be sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the
conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a
supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be
presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.



      3.    Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this
chapter is to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for
responding to every report and incident so that problems can be identified
and remedied by the municipality. However, all municipal employees have the
right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a
formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within
one hundred eighty days of the alleged incident(s), unless it is a continuing
offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within three hundred days.



   C.   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report
(what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.



   D.   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted
and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual
harassment charges, the difficulties associated with their investigation, and
the questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation
is a vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. 



(Ord. 2018-11, § 1 (part), 2018)



2.78.040  Prohibition of retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations. 



   A.   No municipal official, agency,  employee, or office shall take
any retaliatory action against any municipal employee due to his/her:



      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of
this chapter;



      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into
any violation of this chapter; or



      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce
the provisions of this chapter.



   B.   For the purposes of this chapter, “retaliatory action”
means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or
transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal
employee that is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s
involvement in protected activity pursuant to this chapter.



   C.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even
if a report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness
will be protected from retaliation.



   D.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained
herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, §
15-10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action, such as
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or
transfer, that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the
following:



      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to
a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state
agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes
is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation;



      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public
body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a
law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee; or



      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, ILCS Ch. 5, Act
430, §§ 1-1 et seq..



   E.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, §
15(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses
information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative
commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has
reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a
state or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not
retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or
law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe
that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule,
or regulation (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, § 15(b)).



   F.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch. 775, Act
5, § 6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more
people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed
that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual
harassment in employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a
complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation,
proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.



   G.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower-paying job
or passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC,
may file a retaliation charge, which is due within one hundred eighty days
(IDHR) or three hundred days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. 



(Ord. 2018-11, § 1 (part), 2018)



2.78.050  Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual
harassment. 



   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable
pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee
handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates
this chapter or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in ILCS Ch. 5,
Act 430, § 5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to five thousand dollars per
offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality, and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state
law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from
any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties
imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency. 



(Ord. 2018-11, § 1 (part), 2018)



2.78.060  Consequences for knowingly making a false report. 



   A.  A “false report” is a report of sexual harassment made by an
accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than
stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A
“false report” is not a report made in good faith that cannot be proven.
Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or
frivolous report is a severe offense that can, itself, result in disciplinary
action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of this chapter shall be subject to discipline or
discharge pursuant to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements,
procedures, employee handbooks, and/or collective bargaining agreements.



   B.   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the state police, a
state's attorney, the attorney general, or any other law enforcement
official, is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy
an administrative fine of up to five thousand dollars against any person who
intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

3.08.040  Equal employment opportunity clause to be a part of public
contracts.



   The following is added to this chapter pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Illinois Fair Employment Commission. The following clause
shall be made a part of all public contracts:



   EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY



   In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with any provision of
this Equal Opportunity Clause, the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Act or
the Fair Employment Practices Commission's Rules and Regulations for Public
Contractors, the contractor may be declared nonresponsible and therefore
ineligible for future contracts or subcontracts with the State of Illinois or
any political subdivisions or municipal corporations, and the contract may be
cancelled or avoided in while or in part, and such other sanctions or
penalties may be imposed or remedies invoked as provided by statute or
regulation.



   During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as
follows:



   1.   That it will not discriminate against any employee or applicant
for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or
ancestry; and further that it will examine all job classifications to
determine if minority persons or women are underutilized and will take
appropriate affirmative action to rectify any such undemtilization.



   2.   That, if it hires additional employees in order to perform this
contract, or any portion hereof, it will determine the availability (in
accordance with the Commission's Rules and Regulations for Public Contracts)
of minorities and women in the area(s) from which it may reasonably recruit
and it will hire for each job classification for which employees are hired in
such a way that minorities and women are not underutilized.



   3.   That, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees
placed by it or on its behalf, it will state that all applicants will be
afforded equal opportunity without discrimination because of race, color,
religion, sex, national origin or ancestry.



   4.   That it will send to each labor organization or representative
of workers with which it has or is bound by a collective bargaining or other
agreement or understanding, a notice advising such labor organization or
representative of the contractor's obligations under the Illinois Fair
Employment Practices Act and the Commission's Rules and Regulations for
Public Contracts. If any such labor organization or representative fails or
refuses to cooperate with the contractor in its efforts to comply with such
Act and Rules and Regulations, the contractor will promptly so notify the
Illinois Fair Employment Practices Commission and the contracting agency and
will recruit employees from other sources when necessary to fulfill its
obligations thereunder.



   5.   That it will submit reports as required by the Illinois Fair
Employment Practices Commission's Rules and Regulations for Public Contracts,
furnish all relevant information as may from time to time be requested by the
Commission or the contracting agency, and in all respects comply with the
Illinois Fair Employment Practices Act and the Commission's Rules and
Regulations for Public Contracts.



   6.   That it will permit access to all relevant books, records,
accounts and work sites by personnel of the contracting agency and the
Illinois Fair Employment Practices Commission for purposes of investigation
to ascertain compliance with the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Act and
the Commission's Rules and Regulations for Public Contracts.



   7.   That it will include verbatim or by reference the provisions of
paragraphs 1 through 7 of this clause in every performance subcontract as
defined in Section 2.10(b) of the Commission's Rules and Regulations for
Public Contracts so that such provisions will be binding upon every such
sub-contractor; and that it will also so include the provisions of paragraphs
1, 5, 6 and 7 in every supply subcontract as defined in Section 2.10(a) of
the Commission's Rules and Regulations for Public Contracts so that such
provisions will be binding upon every such subcontractor. In the same manner
as with other provisions of this contract, the contractor will be liable for
compliance with applicable provisions of this clause by all its
subcontractors; and further, it will promptly notify the contracting agency
and the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Commission in the event any
sub-contractor fails or refuses to comply therewith. In addition, no
contractor will utilize any subcontractor declared by the Commission to be
nonresponsible and therefore ineligible for contracts or subcontracts with
the State of Illinois or any of its political subdivisions or municipal
corporations.

not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from
the Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application
with the Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A
taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the
amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all
periods prior to the filing of the application, but not more than four (4)
years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid
voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax,
interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was
filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the
amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with
applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the
result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application
shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be
made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary
disclosure application or the date agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator.
However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax
and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within ninety
(90) days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of
the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the Local Tax
Administrator, whichever is longer.

Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the City
Clerk's office.



(Ord. 2001-9 § 16, 2001)



3.40.170  Review procedures. 



   The Local Tax Administrator shall establish an internal review
procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes.
Upon a determination by the Local Tax Administrator that the lien is valid,
the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to
be improper, the Local Tax Administrator shall:



   A.    Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;



   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and



   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.



(Ord. 2001-9 § 17, 2001)

supplement all of the city's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax
ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter
shall be controlling.

of the remaining provisions of this chapter.

      2.   Is used to originate or receive telecommunications
tax-free when such telecommunications are not for resale; or



      3.   Is no longer necessary because the person has
discontinued making resales.



   D.   The act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in the city shall not be made tax-free on the ground of
being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number issued
by the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection
with certifying to the retailer that a sale is nontaxable as the sale for
resale.



(Ord. 2003-4, 2002).



3.44.090  Erroneous payment of tax.

not due under this chapter, whether as a mistake of fact or an error of law,
then such an amount shall be credited against any tax due, or to become due,
under this chapter from the taxpayer who made the erroneous payment. Any
request for a claim shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the
request of a credit.  No amounts erroneously paid more than three years

this chapter or from any investigation conducted under this chapter shall be
confidential unless examination or disclosure is otherwise required by law.



   B.   Nothing in this chapter prevents the city from publishing or
making available to the public the names and addresses of persons filing
returns under this chapter, or reasonable statistics concerning the operation
of the tax by grouping the contents of returns so the information in any
individual return is not disclosed.



   C.   Nothing in this chapter prevents the city from divulging to the
United States Government or any state or local government, or any officer or
agency thereof, for exclusively official purposes, information received by
the city in administering this chapter provided that such other governmental
agency agrees not to divulge requested tax information provided by the city.

with applicable law. Upon conviction for a violation of this chapter, the
violator shall be fined not less than $100 nor more than $750 for each
violation.



   B.   The conviction or punishment or any person for the violation of
this chapter shall not release such person from remitting any amount of tax,
penalty, or interest due hereunder, nor shall the payment of the same prevent
prosecution for the violation of this chapter.  All remedies shall be
cumulative, and the use of one or more remedies by the city shall not bar the
use of any other remedy available under this chapter or at law.



   C.   In case any person fails to file a return when and as required
by this chapter but thereafter, prior to the city's issuance of a notice of
tax liability, files a return and remits the tax, the person shall also pay a
penalty of 5% of the amount of the tax; provided, however, a 20% penalty
shall be imposed for any fraudulent failure to remit such tax.



   D.   In case any person files the return at the time required by
this chapter but fails to remit the tax, or any part thereof, when due, a
penalty of 5% of the amount of the tax unpaid when due shall be added
thereto; provided, however, the fraudulent failure to remit any tax shall
result in a 20% penalty.



   E.   In case any person subject to this chapter fails to file a
return, the city shall determine the amount of tax due from that person
according to its best judgment and information, which amount so fixed by the
city shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the
correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown in such determination.  In
making any such determination of tax due, it shall be permissible for the
city to show a figure that represents the tax due for any given period of six
months instead of showing the amount of tax due for each month separately. 
The city shall issue that person a notice of tax due for the amount of tax
claimed by the city to be due, together with a penalty of 20% thereof.



   F.   In case any person subject to this chapter fails to remit the
tax, or any portion thereof, or any penalty or interest provided for in this
chapter when due, the city may bring suit against that person to recover the
amount of such tax and penalty and interest.



   G.   In addition to any penalty provided for in this chapter, any
amount of tax which is not remitted when due shall bear interest at the rate
of 2% per month or fraction thereof from the date when such tax becomes past
due until such tax is paid voluntarily or pursuant to court order obtained by
the city.

remittance of any tax due under this chapter may, after receiving written
notice of such rule, regulation, or tax determination, appeal such ruling,
regulation, or determination by filing a written notice of appeal in the
office of the City Clerk within 14 calendar days of the person's receipt of

city's representative shall be entitled to present all evidence that is, in
the hearing officer's discretion, relevant and material to the issues framed
and raised in the notice of appeal.



   C.   Within 30 calendar days of the completion of the hearing, the
hearing officer, based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, shall
issue a written decision formally resolving the dispute.  The hearing
officer's decision shall be final and binding.  If the hearing officer
determines that a person shall comply with a rule or regulation or pay or
remit a tax, then such compliance, payment, or remittance shall take place
within seven calendar days of the hearing officer's decision.



   D.   Utilization of this hearing procedure shall not relieve any
person of the obligations to timely and completely pay or remit all other
undisputed taxes.

for their use or consumption and not for sale.



   "Service address" means the location of telecommunications equipment

not be included in gross charges as sales for resale. The term

form.



   B.   Telecommunications retailer, retailer and carrier include every
person engaged in the business of making sales of telecommunications at
retail as defined in this section.  The city may, in its discretion, upon
application, authorize the collection of the fee imposed by this chapter by
any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to
the satisfaction of the city, furnishes adequate security to ensure
collection and payment of the fee.  When so authorized, it shall be the duty

paging services.



(Ord. 2003-5, 2002).



3.48.020  Registration of telecommunications providers.



   A.   Required.  Every telecommunications provider shall register
with the city within 30 days after becoming a telecommunications provider, on
a form to be provided by the city; provided, however, that any
telecommunications retailer that has filed a return pursuant to Section
3.44.060 shall be deemed to have registered in accordance with this section.



   B.   Changes in information.  Every telecommunications provider who
has registered with the city pursuant to subsection A of this section has an
affirmative duty to submit an amended registration form or current return as
required by Section 3.48.040C, as the case may be, to the city within 30 days
from the date of the occurrence of any changes in the information provided by
the telecommunications provider in the registration form or most recent
return on file with the city.



(Ord. 2003-5, 2002).



3.48.030  Fee imposed. 



   A.   A city telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee is
hereby imposed upon all telecommunications retailers, as a percentage of all
gross charges charged by the telecommunications retailer to service addresses
within the city for telecommunications originating or received in the city,
in the amount established of 1% of such charges.



   B.   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this chapter, the city infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized under this chapter shall be the only fee or compensation for the
use of all public rights-of-way within the city by telecommunications
retailers. Imposition of the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under
this chapter does not, however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any
taxes or imposition of any fees otherwise authorized by law.



   C.   The city telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized by this section shall be collected, enforced, and administered as
set forth in Section 3.48.040.



(Ord. 2003-5, 2002).



3.48.040  Collection, enforcement and administration. 



   A.   A telecommunications retailer shall charge to and collect from
each customer an additional charge in an amount equal to the city
infrastructure maintenance fee attributable to that customer's service
address.



   B.   Unless otherwise approved by the Mayor, the infrastructure
maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications retailer to the
city not later than the last day of the month subsequent to the month in
which a bill is issued to the customer; provided, however, that the
telecommunications retailer may retain an amount not to exceed 2% of the city
infrastructure maintenance fee collected by it to reimburse itself for
expenses incurred in accounting for and remitting the fee.



   C.   Remittance of the municipal infrastructure fee to the city
shall be accompanied by a return, in a form to be prescribed by the Mayor,
which shall contain such information as the Mayor may reasonably require.



   D.   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected
pursuant to this chapter and any such infrastructure maintenance fee
collected by such telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by
the telecommunications retailer to the city. The charge imposed under
subsection A of this section by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to
this chapter shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the
telecommunications retailer who provides such services until paid and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such services.



   E.   If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure maintenance
fee has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this chapter,
whether as a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount
shall be credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to
become due, under this chapter, from the telecommunications retailer who made
the erroneous payment; provided, however, the Mayor may request, and the
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such
credit.  However, no claim for such credit may be made more than three years
after the date of the erroneous payment unless:



      1.   The credit is used only to offset a claim of underpayment
made by the city within the applicable statutory period of limitations; and



      2.   The credit derives from an overpayment made by the same
telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of
limitations.



   F.   Amounts paid under this chapter by telecommunications retailers
shall not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts:



      1.   Gross charges for purposes of the Telecommunications
Excise Tax Act;



      2.   Gross receipts for purposes of the municipal utility tax
as prescribed in ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 8-11-2;



      3.   Gross charges for purposes of the municipal
telecommunications tax as prescribed in ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 8-11-17;



      4.   Gross revenue for purposes of the tax on annual gross
revenue of public utilities prescribed in ILCS Ch. 220, Act 5, § 2-202.



   G.   The city shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the
books and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this chapter
to determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted
to the city for the city infrastructure maintenance fee.  Any underpayment
of the amount of the city infrastructure maintenance fee due to the city by
the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the city, plus 5% of the
total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs
incurred by the city in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed 5%
of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit.  Such sum
shall be paid to the city within 21 days after the date of issuance of an
invoice for such sum.



   H.   The Mayor, or his or her designee, may promulgate such further
or additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement of
this chapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time to
time, and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered
pursuant to Section 3.48.020 of such regulations.



(Ord. 2003-5, 2003).



3.48.050  Compliance with other laws. 



   Nothing in this chapter shall excuse any person from obligations
imposed under any law, including but not limited to:



   A.   Generally applicable taxes;



   B.   Standards for construction on, over, under, or within, use of
or repair of the public rights-of-way, including standards relating to
freestanding towers and other structures upon the public rights-of-way, as
provided;



   C.   Any liability imposed for the failure to comply with such
generally applicable taxes or standards governing construction on, over,
under, or within, use of or repair of the public rights-of-way; and



   D.   Compliance with any ordinance or provision of this code
concerning uses or structures not located on, over, or within the
right-of-way.



(Ord. 2003-5, 2002).



3.48.060  Validity of existing franchises and licenses. 



   Any franchise, license, or similar agreement between telecommunications
retailers and the city entered into before the effective date of this chapter
regarding the use of public rights-of-way shall remain valid according to and
for their stated terms, except for any fees, charges or other compensation to
the extent waived.



(Ord. 2003-5, 2002).



3.48.070  Waiver of charges under existing franchises and licenses;
effective date of fee. 



   A.   The city hereby waives all fees, charges, and other
compensation that may accrue, after the effective date of the waiver, to the
city by a telecommunications retailer pursuant to any existing city
franchise, license, or similar agreement with a telecommunications retailer
during the time the city imposes the telecommunications infrastructure
maintenance fee. This waiver shall only be effective during the time the
infrastructure maintenance fee provided for in this chapter is subject to
being lawfully imposed on the telecommunications retailer and collected by
the telecommunications retailer from the customer.



   B.   The City Clerk shall send a notice of the waiver by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to each telecommunications retailer with whom
the city has a franchise.



   C.   The city infrastructure maintenance fee provided for in this
chapter shall become effective and imposed on the first day of the month not
less than 90 days after the city provides written notice by certified mail to
each telecommunications retailer with whom the city has an existing
franchise, license, or similar agreement that the city waives all
compensation under such existing franchise, license, or similar agreement
during such time as the fee is subject to being lawfully imposed and
collected by the retailer and remitted to the city.  The infrastructure
maintenance fee shall apply to gross charges billed on or after the effective
date as established in the preceding sentence.



(Ord. 2003-5, 2002).



3.48.080  Effective date. 



   This chapter shall be in full force and effect upon its adoption by the
City Council of the City of Hoopeston.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   Bed and Breakfast Establishment. An operator-occupied residence at a
specific location providing lodging accommodations for a charge to the public
conforming with the following minimum standards:



      1.   Shall provide five or less rooms for rent.



      2.   Shall be in operation (available to the public) more than

5.45.02  Statement of purpose. 



   The purpose of this chapter is to accommodate the tradition of opening
up one's residence to travelers as they pass through the community. This
tradition has been brought into the 20th century in a form called "Bed and
Breakfast Establishments". This chapter is intended to encourage the
development of such facilities in the city, while at the same time
establishing minimum regulations which are intended to protect and preserve
the character of the neighborhoods in which these facilities are usually
found and to protect the traveling public. Further, this trend is seen as one
way to preserve and perhaps restore some of the city's more valuable
historically and architecturally significant structures that might otherwise
be lost due to economic conditions.



(Ord. 2007-1, 2007).

nuisance, he shall forthwith give the person in charge or control of the
property thereof notice, served upon such person by a police officer of the
city or by mailing such notice to his last known address, that such condition
exists, and that he shall have five days from the date of such service in
which to remedy the same or the city shall cause the same to be remedied. 
In the event that a person has received notice under this subsection of a
nuisance condition upon his land any further violations by said person under

days after the date the last notice of such violation was mailed, shall be
prosecuted without further notice or warning.

neglects to remedy a nuisance within the time allowed after having been
served a notice to abate such nuisance, the police chief or zoning
administrator may cause such condition to be remedied.  Such action shall
not provide a defense for failure to comply with this chapter.  In the
alternative, the city may, immediately after the expiration of the time
specified in the notice, bring suit for violation of this chapter.



   C.   Removal Costs a Lien on the Property. In the event that payment
of the actual costs of the abatement of any nuisance by the city under the
provisions of this chapter is not made on demand, such costs shall become a
lien upon the property from which such nuisance was abated. The amount of
such lien shall be added to the tax roll and collected as unpaid taxes. Any
such lien may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure
of liens. In the alternative, the city may sue to recover the actual costs
expended by the city in the abatement of any nuisance under the provisions of
this code.

135.02, 135.03, 136.02, 136.03, 138.01, 138.03, 138.11, 138.12, 139.02,

period, or (2)  the offense for which the premises is used is punishable by
imprisonment for one year or more.



(Ord. 2003-1 § 1, 2002).



8.12.060  Order of abatement. 



   The Chief of Police or other authorized representative of the city may
bring an action to abate a public nuisance described by this chapter.  An
order of abatement shall be issued whenever a person who owns, manages or
controls any premises encourages or permits any of the illegal activity
described in Section 8.12.050 on those premises.  The order of abatement
shall require the taking of reasonable measures designed to prevent the
reoccurrence of the illegal activity.  Those measures may include, but not
be limited to, making improvements to real estate and installing lighting to
enhance security, the hiring of security personnel, the hiring of a receiver,
or the initiation and execution of eviction proceedings against tenants
engaged in illegal activity on the premises.  The order of abatement may
also authorize the issuance of ex parte administration search warrants
reasonably calculated to determine whether the nuisance has been abated or
whether the order of abatement has been obeyed.



(Ord. 2003-1 § 1, 2002).



8.12.070  Notice of violation. 



   Whenever the Chief of Police or authorized representative of the city
reasonably believes that any premises constitutes a public nuisance as
described in this chapter, he or she may give written notice to the person
who owns or controls the premises stating that a nuisance exists and
identifying reasonable abatement measures that must be taken within 30 days
of a notice.  The notice shall be in writing and may be served in person or
sent by first class mail to the last known address of the person alleged to
own or maintain the premises in question. The notice shall provide the
recipient with contact information and give a reasonable opportunity to meet
with a representative of the city to discuss the allegations in the notice
and the need for abatement measures.  In any proceeding held according to
this chapter, when the city establishes by a preponderance of the evidence
that the premises for which a notice had been sent is a nuisance as described
in this section, the failure to implement the abatement measures identified
in the notice, or subsequently agreed to within the 30-day period following
the notice, or within any other agreed upon period, shall create a
presumption that the person who owns, manages or controls the premises has
encouraged or permitted illegal activity in violation of this chapter.  The
presumption may be rebutted only by a preponderance of the evidence.



(Ord. 2014-8, 2013; Ord. 2003-1 § 1, 2002).



8.12.080  Penalty for violation.



   A.   Any person, firm or corporation violating any provision of
Sections 8.12.030 and 8.12.040 or permitting a nuisance to remain on property
owned by him shall be subject to the general penalty provisions of this code.



   B.   Any person who owns, manages or controls any premises and who
encourages or permits an illegal activity described in Section 8.12.050 to
occur or continue on such premises shall be subject to a fine of not less
than $200 nor more than $1,000 for each offense plus costs and reasonable
attorney fees.  Each day that a violation of Section 8.12.050 continues
shall be considered a separate and distinct offense.  A person may be found
in violation of Section 8.12.050 regardless of whether an order of abatement
is issued under Section 8.12.060 or whether a notice has been given under
Section 8.12.070.  In addition to any fine imposed, the court may, without
notice or bond, enter a temporary restraining order or a preliminary
injunction to enjoin any person from maintaining such nuisance.  The court
may further order that the premises be closed and secured against all use and
occupancy for a period of not less than 30 days or may employ any other
remedy deemed appropriate to abate the nuisance.

hearing within 72 hours after the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays. The designated hearing officer shall be the mayor or his or her
designee. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
be heard at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the
hearing and the hearsay evidence shall be admissible. If, after the hearing,
the hearing officer determines there is probable cause to believe that the
vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, the
hearing officer shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle until
the full evidentiary hearing pursuant to this section, unless the vehicle
owner posts the applicable cash bond, and a notice of such full evidentiary
hearing shall be given to the vehicle owner.



   B.   Unless the vehicle owner has received a notice after a hearing
held pursuant to subsection A above, or if the owner of record is otherwise
personally serviced with the notice of hearing and acknowledges the receipt
of the notice in writing, within ten days after a motor vehicle is seized and
impounded pursuant to this chapter, the city or designee shall notify, or
send notice by certified mail return receipt requested, the owner of record
of the date, time and location of a full evidentiary hearing concerning the
seizure and impoundment. Such hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless
continued by order of the hearing officer, no later than 31 days after the
motor vehicle was seized.



   C.   If, after the hearing set forth in subsection B above, the
hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the motor
vehicle was used in the commission of or in conjunction with any of the
offenses described in Section 10.02.010 and that none of the exceptions set
forth in Section 10.02.020 apply, then the hearing officer shall enter an
order finding the owner of record of the motor vehicle civilly liable to the
city and impose the penalties set forth in this chapter. If a cash bond has
been previously posted the bond shall be applied to the fees owed under
Section 10.02.060. If the hearing officer determines that no such violation
occurred, the hearing officer shall order the return of the motor vehicle
and/or any cash bond posted.



   D.   In the event that the owner of record desires to appeal the
decision of the hearing officer under the provisions of the Illinois
Administrative Review Act, he shall pay the costs of the preparation and
transcription of the record of the hearing.



(Ord. 2013-4, 2012).

shall be liable for an administrative penalty in the amount of three hundred

include, but not be limited to, the costs associated with an administrative
adjudication proceeding or court proceeding, and reasonable attorney's fee.



   C.   If a penalty is imposed pursuant to this chapter, such penalty
shall constitute a debt due and owing to the city. The owner of record's
obligation to pay such debt to the city shall be independent of the city's
return of any impounded motor vehicle. If a bond has been posted, the hearing
office shall enter an order deducting any fines and fees imposed pursuant to
this chapter from the bond so posted.



   D.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an impounded
motor vehicle shall be returned to the owner of record, or other person who
is legally entitled to possess the motor vehicle, upon his or her payment to
the city of the penalty or penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter,
including the towing and storage fees, unless the motor vehicle has been sold
or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as provided
by law.



   E.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, whenever
a person with a lien of record against a motor vehicle impounded under this
chapter has commended foreclosure or repossession proceedings, possession of
the motor vehicle shall be given to that person, but only upon agreeing, in
writing, to refund to the city the net proceeds of any sale of the motor
vehicle, less any amounts necessary to pay all lien holders of record, up to

administrative order is entered against an owner of a record who is found in
default, may be disposed of as an unclaimed motor vehicle as provided by law.



(Ord. 2013-4, 2012).



10.02.080  Severability.

the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

such turn. But vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to other
vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time such
signal is exhibited.



      2.   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the

any vehicle within this city while:



      1.   The alcohol concentration in such person's blood or
breath is 0.10 or more based on the definition of blood and breath units in

driving.



   B.   The fact that any person charged with violating this section is

(Ord. 83-7 § 1, 1982: prior code § 10.701).



10.24.011  Suspension of driver's license-Implied consent.



   A.   Any person who drives or is in actual physical control of a
motor vehicle upon the public highways of this city shall be deemed to have
given consent, subject to the provisions of Section 10.24.012, to a chemical
test or tests of blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, other drug, or combination thereof content of such person's blood if
arrested, as evidenced by the issuance of a uniform traffic ticket, for any
offense as defined in Section 10.24.010. The test or tests shall be
administered at the direction of the arresting officer. The law enforcement
agency employing said officer shall designate which of the aforesaid tests
shall be administered by their enforcement personnel.



   B.   Any person who is dead, unconscious or who is otherwise in a
condition rendering such person incapable of refusal shall be deemed to not
have withdrawn the consent provided by subsection (A) of this section and the
test or tests may be administered, subject to the provisions of Section
10.24.012.



   C.   A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall
be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal
to submit to the test will result in suspension of such person's license to
operate a motor vehicle for six months for the first such arrest and refusal
and a suspension of such privilege for twelve months for the second and each
subsequent such arrest and refusal within five years. Following this warning,
if a person under arrest refuses upon the request of a law enforcement
officer to submit to a test designated by the law enforcement agency as
provided in subsection (A) of this section, none shall be given, but the law
enforcement officer shall file with the clerk of the circuit court for the
county in which the arrest was made, a sworn statement naming the person
refusing to take and complete the test or tests requested under the
provisions of this section. Such sworn statement shall identify the arrested
person, such person's driver's license number and current residence address
and shall specify that a refusal by said person to take the test or tests was
made. Such sworn statement shall include a statement that the arresting
officer had reasonable cause to believe the person was driving the motor
vehicle within this city while under the influence of alcohol, other drug, or
combination thereof and that such test or tests were made as an incident to
and following the lawful arrest for an offense as defined in Section
10.24.010, and that the person after being arrested for an offense arising
out of acts alleged to have been committed while so driving or in actual
physical control of a motor vehicle refused to submit to and complete a test
or tests as requested by the law enforcement officer.



   The clerk shall thereupon notify such person in writing that the
person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle will be suspended unless,
within twenty-eight days from the date of mailing of the notice, such person
shall request in writing a hearing thereon; if the person desires a hearing,
such person shall file a complaint in the circuit court for and in the county
in which such, person was arrested for such 'hearing. Such hearing shall
proceed in the court in the same manner as other civil proceedings, shall
cover only the issues of whether the person was placed under arrest for an
offense as defined in Section 10.24.010 as evidenced by the issuance of a
uniform traffic ticket; whether the arresting officer had reasonable grounds
to believe that such person was driving or in actual physical control of a
motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, other drug, or
combination thereof; and whether such person refused to submit and complete
the test or tests upon the request of the law enforcement officer. Whether
the person was informed that such person's privilege to drive would be
suspended if such person refused to submit to the test or tests shall not be
an issue.



   Immediately upon the termination of the court proceedings, the clerk
shall notify the Secretary of State of the court's decision. The Secretary of
State shall thereupon suspend the driver's license, the privilege of driving
a motor vehicle on highways of this state given to a nonresident, or the
privilege which an unlicensed person might have to obtain a license under the
Driver's License Act, of the arrested person if that be the decision of the
court. If the court recommends that such person be given a restricted driving
permit to prevent undue hardship, the clerk shall so report to the Secretary
of State.



   D.   Regardless of whether such person files a complaint in the
court for a court proceeding as provided in subsection (C) of this section,
whenever a driver's license is suspended under this section, the Secretary of
State may, if application is made therefor by the person whose license is so
suspended, issue such person a restricted driver's permit, to prevent undue
hardship, in the same manner, under the same conditions and with the same
limitations specified in Chapter 95½, Section 6-205 of the Illinois Revised
Statutes.



   If the person has had a court hearing as provided for in subsection (C)
of this section and if the court recommended that such person be given a
restricted driver's permit to prevent undue hardship, this recommendation
shall be made a part of the hearing before the Secretary of State.



(Ord. 83-7 § 2, 1982).



10.24.012  Chemical and other test.



   A.   Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding
arising out of an arrest for an offense as defined in Section 10.24.010,
evidence of the concentration of alcohol, other drug or combination thereof
in a person's blood or breath at the time alleged, as determined by analysis
of the person's blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance, shall be
admissible. Where such test is made the following provisions shall apply:



      1.   Chemical analyses of the person's blood, urine, breath or
other bodily substance to be considered valid under the provisions of this
section shall have been performed according to standards promulgated by the
department of public health in consultation with the department of law
enforcement by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by that
department for this purpose. The director of the department of public health
in consultation with the department of law enforcement is authorized to
approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications
and competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, to issue permits
which shall be subject to termination or revocation at the discretion of that
department and to certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The
Illinois Department of Public Health shall prescribe regulations as necessary
to implement this section.



      2.   When a person shall submit to a blood test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under the provisions of Section 10.24.011, only
a physician authorized to practice medicine, a registered nurse or other
qualified person approved by the department of public health may withdraw
blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug
content therein. This limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath or
urine specimens.



      3.   The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified
technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of their own
choosing administered a chemical test or tests in addition to any
administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of
a law enforcement officer.



      4.   Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a
chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full
information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the
person or such person's attorney.



      5.   Alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol
per one hundred milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath.



   B.   Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding
arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while
driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person's blood or breath at
the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person's blood, urine, breath,
or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:



      1.   If there was at the time an alcohol concentration of 0.05
or less, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of
alcohol.



      2.   If there was at the time an alcohol concentration in
excess of 0.05 but less than 0.10, such facts shall not give rise to any
presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol,
but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining
whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.



      3.   If there was at the time an alcohol concentration of 0.10
or more, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of
alcohol.



      4.   The foregoing provisions of this section shall not be
construed as limiting the introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing
upon the question whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.



   C.   If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test
under the provisions of Section 10.24.011, evidence of refusal shall be
admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts
alleged to have been committed while the person was under the influence of
alcohol, or other drugs, or combination of both was driving or in actual
physical control of a motor vehicle.



(Ord. 83-7 § 3, 1982).



10.24.013  Transportation of alcoholic liquor.



   A.   Except as provided in subsection (B) of this section, no person
shall transport, carry, possess or have any alcoholic liquor within the
passenger area of any motor vehicle except in the original container and with
the seal unbroken.



   B.   This section shall not apply to the passengers of a chartered
bus designed for carrying more than ten persons when it is being used for the
transportation of said persons. However, this provision of subsection (B)
shall not extend to buses chartered for school purposes. The driver of any
such vehicle is prohibited from consuming or having any alcoholic liquor in
or about the driving area of any such vehicle.



   C.   Evidence of alcoholic consumption alone shall be prima facie
evidence of the driver's failure to obey subsection (B) of this section.



(Ord. 83-9, 1982).



10.24.020  Accident assistance and reporting.



   The driver of a vehicle which has collided with, or been in an accident
with any vehicle, person or property in such a manner as to cause injury or
damage, shall stop immediately, and render such assistance as may be
possible, and give his true name and residence to the injured person or any
other persons requesting the same on behalf of the injured person, or the
owner of the property damaged, and to a policeman, if one is present. The
driver of each vehicle concerned in any such accident shall report to the
nearest police authority promptly after such accident.



(Prior code § 10.702).



10.24.030  Fleeing or attempting to elude police officer.



   Any driver or operator of a motor vehicle who, having been given a
visual or audible signal by a peace officer directing such driver or operator
to bring his vehicle to a stop, wilfully fails or refuses to obey such
direction, increases his speed, extinguishes his lights, or otherwise flees
or attempts to elude the officer, is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
fined not less than fifty dollars nor more than five hundred dollars. The
signal given by the peace officer may be by hand, voice, siren, red or blue
light; provided, the officer giving such signal shall be in a police uniform,
and, if driving a vehicle, such vehicle shall be marked, showing it to be an
official police vehicle.

building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the
building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building
and the whole considered as one building sewer, subject to approval of the
superintendent. Separate and independent buildings on the same lot or
separate trailers shall require separate sewer hook-ups unless, in the
determination of the superintendent, such separate hookups could not be
reasonably accomplished. Sewer hookups shall be entirely uncovered for

at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to any bearing wall if within three feet of any wall, which might
thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from
frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight
alignment in so far as possible. Changes in direction or grade shall be
allowed only when a proper manhole is constructed at the location of the
change.



(Prior code § 20.509).



13.20.100  Buildings where drain will not permit gravity flow.



   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.



(Prior code § 20.510).



13.20.110  Excavations-Method and specifications.

shall be permitted on the jointing material until after the joint has been
tested and approved.



   B.   All joints in vitrified clay pipe or between such pipe and
metals shall be made with approved hot-poured jointing material, approved
rubber gaskets, Okum and sewertite, Okum and AmVit, or an approved equal
method and material.



   C.   Material for hot-poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to
destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of one
hundred sixty degrees Fahrenheit, nor be soluble in any of the wastes carried
by the drainage system. The joint shall first be caulked tight with jute,
hemp, or similar approved material.



   D.   Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by
approval of the superintendent.



(Ord. 81-50 § 6, 1980; prior code§ 20.512).



13.20.140  Connection of building sewer into public sewer.



   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at the Y branch, if such branch is available. If the public sewer is
eight inches in diameter or less, and no properly located Y branch is
available, the owner shall, at his expense, install a Y branch in the public
sewer at the location specified by the superintendent. Where the public sewer
is greater than eight inches in diameter with tapping saddle, and no properly
located Y branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer
to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an
angle of about forty-five degrees. A forty-five degree ell may be used to
make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the
inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the
point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the
invert of the public sewer, but no higher than a point one-half the vertical
distance between the invert and the crown of the sewer. A smooth, neat joint
shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in
concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved
by the superintendent. Manholes shall be constructed at any junction of a
ten-inch diameter line or larger into a public sewer.

enter at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to the
public water supply or distribution system of the city for the purpose of
verifying information submitted by the customer regarding the required
cross-connection control inspection. On demand the owner, lessees or
occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the Superintendent of
Water any information which he may request regarding the piping system or
systems or water use on such property.  The refusal of such information,
when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Superintendent of Water,

the water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of the
provisions of this section is known to exist, and to take such other
precautionary measures as he may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water supply distribution mains.  Water service
to such property shall not be restored until such conditions have been
eliminated or corrected in compliance with the provisions of this section,
and until a re-connection fee equal to the cost incurred by the city is paid
to the city.  Immediate disconnection with verbal notice can be effected
when the Superintendent of Water is assured that imminent danger of harmful
contamination of the public water supply system exists.  Such action shall
be followed by written notification of the cause of disconnection. 
Immediate disconnection without notice to any party can be effected to
prevent actual or anticipated contamination or pollution of the public water
supply, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the Superintendent of
Water or the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, such action is
required to prevent actual or potential contamination or pollution of the
public water supply.  Neither the public water supply, the Superintendent of
Water, or its agents or assigns shall be liable to any customer for any
injury, damages or lost revenues which may result from termination of the
customer's water supply in accordance with the terms of this section, whether

service is supplied pursuant to the terms and provisions of ILCS Ch. 65, Act
5, § 11-139-8. Statements rendered for such charge shall be deemed notice to
all parties, whether or not the person charged with the statement is the
owner of the property served. The claim for lien shall be made in the form of
a sworn statement setting out (1) a description of the real estate,
sufficient for the identification thereof, upon or for which the sewage
service was supplied, (2) the amount or amounts of money due for such sewage
service, and (3) the date or dates when such amount or amounts became
delinquent. If all amounts shown due remain unpaid after recording as
provided by law, the city may foreclose such lien in like manner and with
like effect as in the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate. In the
alternative, the city may, in its discretion, file suit to collect such
amounts as are delinquent and due against the occupant or user of the real
estate in a civil action, and shall collect, as well, all attorney's fees
incurred by it, the same to be fixed by order of the court In addition to
penalties and costs attributable and chargeable to the recording of such
notices of lien, user and owner shall be liable for interest upon all unpaid
balances after delinquency remaining from time to time unpaid at the rate of
six percent per year.



   B.   In all cases where the sewer service charge has become
delinquent and the city elects to tile a statement thereof in the office of
recorder of deeds as hereinabove set forth, there shall be added in addition
to the amount due the city such charges and expenses as are necessary and
required to verify the legal description of the property to which the lien is
to attach, plus a sum established by the city council as sufficient to cover
the cost of preparation of such notices and forms required. In each instance,
the superintendent or a duly appointed employee of the city shall be
authorized and directed to include such additional costs in the amount
claimed due the city in the notice of lien.



   C.   The city reserves the right to revoke discharge permits and
disconnect service to any user whenever wastewater treatment bills or
industrial cost recovery bills become delinquent



   D.   All amounts charged under this section are due and shall
continue to be due hereunder, whether or not said sewer is disconnected, and
no sewer shall be reconnected until the city is paid in full for all amounts
due it and in addition, there shall be paid the city a deposit equal to the
estimated charge for the next succeeding year. Such deposit shall be held by
the city in escrow, and will be returned upon satisfactory payment of bills
for a period of two years.

15.32.110  Variances. 



   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the zoning board of
appeals for a variance. The zoning board of appeals shall  review the
applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the
city council. The city council may attach such conditions to granting of a
variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.



   A.   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that all of the following conditions are met:



      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the
floodplain;



      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were
not granted;

writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protections
standards of § 15.32.070 that would lessen the degree of protection to a
building will:



      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to twenty-five dollars per one hundred dollars of insurance coverage;



      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and



      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of
these risks and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of
the risk and liability.



   C.   Historic structures.  Variances to the building protection
requirements of § 15.32.070 which are requested in connection with
reconstruction, repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic
structure as defined in § 15.32.020, may be granted using criteria more
permissive than the requirements of §§ 15.32.060 and 15.32.070 subject to
the conditions that:



      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure;



      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the
structure being removed as a certified historic structure.



   D.   Agriculture.  Any variance granted for an agricultural
structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of
the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the
following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in
this chapter.



   In order to minimize flood damages during the one hundred-year flood
and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be
included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are
constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.



      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance
from the floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate
that the varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and
no other alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists
for the agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.



      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to
agricultural purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).



      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural
structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e.,
foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.)
below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials
in accordance with § 15.32.070.



      4.   The agricultural structures must he adequately anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in
accordance with § 15.32.070. All of the building's structural components
must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including
hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.



      5.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment
must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they
are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with § 15.32.070.



      6.   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls,
subject to the one hundred-year flood, contain openings that will permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with § 15.32.070B.



      7.   The agricultural structures must comply with the
floodplain management floodway provisions of § 15.32.060. No variances may
be issued for agricultural structures within any designated floodway.



      8.   Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be
reviewed and approved by the floodplain administrator and a registered
professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain
development permit for construction. 



(Ord. 2012-15 § 11, 2012).



15.32.120  Disclaimer of liability. 



   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the
floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create
liability on the part of the City of Hoopeston or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. 



(Ord. 2012-15 § 12, 2012).



15.32.130  Penalty. 



   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure
to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be
a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the city building
inspector or city attorney may determine that a violation of the minimum
standards of this chapter exists. The city building inspector or city
attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.



   A.   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the
violation:



      1.   The City of Hoopeston shall make application to the
circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or
make such other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with
the chapter;



      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon
conviction thereof be fined not less than fifty dollars or more than seven
hundred fifty for each offense;

day during or on which a violation occurs or continues; and



      4.   The City of Hoopeston shall record a notice of violation
on the title of the property.



   B.   1.   The city building inspector or city attorney shall
inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to
increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood
insurance policy to be suspended.



      2.   The city building inspector or city attorney is
authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject
development.  The stop-work order shall be in writing, indicate the reason
for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve the
circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order constitutes
a suspension of the permit. No site development permit shall be permanently
suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the zoning board of appeals.
Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall
state:



         a.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for
suspension or revocation; and



         b.   The time and place of me hearing.



      3.   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an
opportunity to present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall
be suspended or revoked.



   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Hoopeston from taking
such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. 



(Ord. 2012-15 § 13, 2012).



15.32.140  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 



   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city
council to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program
including: Ordinance 95-13,1995; Ordinance 534,1976 However, this chapter
does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve
eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter
and other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

   The purposes and objectives regarding land subdivision can best be
understood by considering the various duties and responsibilities associated
with land subdividing. The specific duties and responsibilities of the
individual or groups listed below are clearly identified in these regulations.



   A.   Subdivides The subdivider is responsible for initiating
discussions with the city before thoroughly preparing any subdivision plans
or plats in order to become familiar with these regulations and the public
policies and objectives applicable to the territory in which the proposed
subdivision lies.



   B.   Engineer and Surveyor. The engineer and surveyor acting on
behalf of the subdivider are responsible for preparing the necessary
subdivision plans, surveys and plats and the engineering drawings and
specifications as required by these regulations.



   C.   Reviewing Authority. The reviewing authority is the plan
commission and the council of the city who are responsible for reviewing the
subdivision plan or plat, or portions thereof, and approving those that fully
meet the provisions and requirements of these regulations.



(Ord. 81-10 § 2.3, 1980).



16.12.040  Informal discussion phase.



   The purpose of the informal discussion phase, insofar as possible, is
to guide and assist the subdivider in his future decisions with a view to
avoiding later difficulties and delays. This is the basic policy stage,
during which the subdivider meets informally with the Hoopeston plan
commission. In the course of the discussion the subdivider should make known
his tentative plans for subdividing and development, may exhibit sketch plans
and shall be apprised by the Hoopeston plan commission concerning specific
public policies and objectives which the commission may have for the area in
question. Discussion at this phase shall involve the entire area of ownership
and anticipated development.



(Ord. 81-10 § 2.4, 1980).



16.12.050  Review procedure.



   A.   Submission. A preapplication conference may be requested by all
subdivides prior to initial plat applications. Subdividers may contact the
chairman of the plan commission to arrange a preapplication conference.
Subdividers may submit an area general plan with material sufficient to
identify the tract and establish the relationship of the proposed development
with the surrounding area.



   B.   Processing. Upon a request for a preapplication conference, the
chairman of the plan commission shall schedule the preapplication conference
at the next regular meeting of the plan commission. All materials will be
considered as submitted for informal discussion. Discussions will involve the
proposals in compliance with these regulations, determination of the scope of
the proposed subdivision, an outline of the procedures for the recording of
plats and general information exchange. No approvals will result from this
conference; however, the plan commission may make recommendations on the
scope of the initial plat application by the subdivider, continuity of the
proposed street pattern with existing or proposed streets adjacent to the
proposed subdivision, and other factors based on peculiarities of the area in
which the subdivision is prepared.



   C.   Review. Review of any material submitted by the subdivider
during the informal discussion phase shall be made by the plan commission.
Any sketch plan submitted, shall be studied with regard to the best
principles of land subdividing and development; to lot sizes, and
proportions; to existing and planned land uses; to topography and drainage;
to provisions for recreation area, public open space, schools, parks and
other public facilities; to design and location of streets; and to conformity
with the continuity of existing street system, walkways and related matters.



   D.   Inspection. A member of the plan commission or the entire plan
commission will make an inspection of the site to determine its relationship
to an effect upon major thoroughfares, utilities and adjacent land uses
(existing and planned) and ascertain the existence of any unusual problems;
and shall determine:



      1.   The conformity of the proposed development to existing
zoning regulations, official road maps, and municipal development plans and
policies;



      2.   The effect of the proposed development upon schools,
public open spaces, and other nearby community facilities;



      3.   The need for preparation and review of an area general
plan prior to consideration of the preliminary plat.

17.48.020  Use regulations.



   A.   All mobile homes or trailers shall be established upon a mobile
home zoning district and those not in such district shall be considered
nonconforming uses. Such use shall be permitted until any such mobile home or
trailer is moved from its present location, destroyed by any means rendering
it uninhabitable, is not inhabited for any continuous period of ninety days
or more, or is found in violation of any other state statute or county or
city ordinance if such violation(s) remain uncorrected for ninety days or
more after notice to the tenant or owner of such mobile home. Delivery of the
notice by ordinary mail to the address of the mobile home or posting of the
notice setting forth the alleged violations shall be considered good and
sufficient notice to owner or tenant for the purposes of extinguishing all
rights of nonconforming use under this title.



   B.   In the event any such mobile home or trailer is moved from its
present location or is otherwise no longer qualified for a nonconforming use
under the provisions of subsection A above, then the mobile home or trailer
shall be removed immediately from its present location and no substitute
mobile home or trailer can be moved into or anywhere upon the location.



   C.   In the event the owner or his agent fails to remove the mobile
home or trailer within thirty days of expiration of the right of
nonconforming use as provided for above, then the city is authorized to seize
and remove the mobile home or trailer and file a lien for all costs and
expenses incurred for the removal, against the property upon which the mobile
home was located, or bring suit for the costs or expenses, or both, at city's
option.



   D.   Upon the termination of such nonconforming use, either by
removal of a trailer or mobile home or by any of the eventualities or
provisions set forth above, the space occupied by the mobile home or trailer
shall be governed by the respective district in which the property is located.

   A.   Any non-conforming use, building, structure, or lot, as defined
in this title may be continued under the regulations of this chapter, with
the exception of mobile homes and trailers as provided in Chapter 17.48,
Mobile Home Park District, and Section 17.72.090, Nonconforming signs. This
chapter shall not be interpreted as authorizing the continuation of any
noncompliance with the regulations of this title which was not lawfully
existing on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or
lawfully existing on the date the ordinance codified in this title became
effective as to such structure, building, use, lot, or land. Any
nonconformity which conformed with the provisions of any previous zoning
ordinance applicable to it, or which was rendered nonconforming by an
amendment to this title, shall be considered lawful, and may continue as a
nonconformity under the provisions of this title.



   B.   If a building, structure, land or use thereof, which hereafter
becomes subject to the provisions of this title, whether by annexation to the
city or otherwise, does not conform with all applicable provisions of this
title, it shall be considered lawful, and may continue as a nonconformity
under the provisions of this chapter. No building, structure, lot, land, or
use thereof, which does not conform to the applicable regulations of this
title, and does not qualify as an authorized nonconformity as defined herein,
shall be considered lawful or be permitted to continue under the provisions
of this title.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVI § 1, 1980).



17.72.020  Extension of nonconforming use.



   Any lawful nonconforming use of a portion of a building may be extended
throughout the building, and any lawful nonconforming use, may be extended or
enlarged upon the lot occupied by such building that is held in single and
separate ownership on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
title, provided that the area of such buildings shall not be increased by
more than a total of twenty-five percent of the area of such building
existing on the date it first became a lawful nonconforming building or a
building on which a lawful nonconforming use is made, and provided further,
that any structural alteration, extension or addition, shall conform with all
height, area, width, yard and coverage requirements, for the district in
which it is located and shall comply with all provisions of this title except
as noted in Section 17.72.030.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVI § 2. 1980).



17.72.030  Exceptions to side yard requirements in R-l and R-2 residential
districts.



   The side yard regulations contained in Chapters 17.20 and 17.24 shall
not apply to the extension of any existing residence, either into the front
yard or into the back yard, as long as such extension is a continuation of
the side of the existing structure. The extension permitted by this section
shall not reduce the side yard width as it exists prior to the extension.



   This section shall not change the front yard, rear yard, or building
coverage requirements, or any other requirements in the R-1 and R-2
residential districts.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVI § 3, 1980).



17.72.040  Change of use.



   Any lawful nonconforming use of a building or land may be changed to
another nonconforming use of the same classification, which shall thereafter
not be subject to any further change except to a conforming use, and for such
purpose, a building may be extended in accordance with Section 17.72.020.
Wherever a nonconforming use or a building or a land has been changed to a
conforming use, such conforming use shall not thereafter be changed to a
nonconforming use.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVI § 4, 1980).



17.72.050  Restoration of damaged building or structure.



   Any lawful nonconforming building or other structure which has been
involuntarily damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, windstorm, or other
similar active cause, to an extent of not more than seventy-five percent of
its fair market value, may be reconstructed in the same location, provided
that:



   A.   The reconstructed building or structure shall not exceed the
height, area, or volume of the damaged or destroyed building or structure
except as provided in Section 17.72.020, and:



   B.   Reconstruction shall begin within one year from the date of
damage or destruction and shall be carried on without interruption.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVI § 5, 1980).



17.72.060  Use of abandonment or discontinuance.



   If a lawful nonconforming use of a building or other structure is
abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of one year or more, or if
a lawful nonconforming use of land is abandoned or discontinued for a
continuous period of six months or more, subsequent use of such building or
structure or land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this title.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVI § 6, 1980).



17.72.070  Use of nonconforming lots.



   A.   When authorized as a variance, a building may be erected or
altered on any lot held in single and separate ownership on the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this title which is not of the required
minimum area or width or is of such unusual dimensions that the owner would
have difficulty in providing the required open spaces for the district in
which the lot is situated.



   B.   Where two or more contiguous undeveloped lots are held in
single ownership, within a subdivision which has been duly recorded prior to
the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, which lots are
individually not of the required minimum area or width for the district in
which they are situated, no variance shall be required for the issuance of
building permits, provided that such lots shall be developed in groups or
fractions thereof, as single lots, to provide the minimum lot frontage
required for each structure.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVI § 7, 1980).



17.72.080  Subdivisions previously approved.



   In the case of a plot of land, a plan for the subdivision of which into
two or more parcels or lots for the purpose of development and sale has,
prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, been
duly approved and recorded as required by law, which plan does not make
provisions for full adherence to the regulations of this title governing
minimum lot areas or widths, front, side or rear yards, or building coverage,
but was in conformity with such regulations as were effective at the time
such plan was approved and recorded, the development and sale contemplated by
the plan may be proceeded with when authorized as a variance. The city
council after receiving the recommendation of the board of appeals shall have
power to grant a variance with respect to the whole of such plot of land or
any portion thereof.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVI § 8, 1980).



17.72.090  Nonconforming signs.



   A.   Signs which do not conform to the provisions of Chapter 17.60
as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title are
nonconforming uses.



   B.   A nonconforming sign may not be:



      1.   Changed to another nonconforming sign;



      2.   Structurally altered as to prolong the life of the sign;



      3.   Expanded:



      4.   Reestablished after its removal for ninety days;



      5.   Reestablished after damage or destruction, if the
estimated expense of reconstruction exceeds fifty percent of the appraised
replacement cost at the time of the damage or destruction;



      6.   Routinely maintained where the cost of such repair or
maintenance exceeds five percent of the current replacement costs for any
period of twelve months. However, nothing in this section shall be deemed to
prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any sign or
part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting
the public safety;



      7.   Relocated unless such relocation brings the sign into
conformance with all the requirements of this title, except that where a
nonconforming sign is located within a right-of-way taken or acquired by a
public body for street improvement purposes, then the relocation of such a
sign is permitted.



   C.   All nonconforming signs shall be removed or brought into
conformity with this title within ten years of the effective date of the
ordinance codified in this title.



   D.   The city council after receiving the recommendation of the
board of appeals shall have the power to grant a variance from the provisions
of subsection B of this section, so as to permit change, alteration,
reestablishment, or more than routine maintenance of a nonconforming sign
where such change, alteration, reestablishment, or maintenance shall not
increase the size of the sign, make it radiate or reflect more light, or
otherwise make it visually more objectionable. No such variance granted by
the city council shall in any way postpone the time for removal of the
nonconforming sign as provided in subsection C of this section beyond the
time when the original sign which was permitted to be changed, altered,
reestablished, or maintained hereunder would have been required to be removed.

17.76.010  Purpose.



   Planned unit developments (PUD) are of such substantially different
characteristics from conditional uses and subdivision ordinance control that
specific and additional standards and exceptions are hereby set out to govern
the recommendations of the plan commission and the action of the city council.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 1, 1980).



17.76.020  General goals.



   General goals of a planned unit development are as follows:



   A.   To promote flexibility in design and permit planned
diversification in the location of structures;



   B.   To promote an efficient use of land to facilitate a more
economic arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land uses and
utilities, and the conservation of energy;



   C.   To preserve to the greatest extent possible the existing
landscape features and amenities, and to utilize such features in a
harmonious fashion;



   D.   To provide for more usable and suitably located recreation
facilities and other public and common facilities than would otherwise be
provided under conventional land development procedures;



   E.   To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms,
and building relationships within the PUD.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 4, 1980).



17.76.030  Permitted uses.



   A.   Residential PUDs, permitted under the provisions of this
section in the A-1 and R districts, may include any use permitted by right or
as a conditional use as a principal or accessory use in the A-1 or any R
districts. A maximum of ten percent of the gross site area of a residential
PUD may be devoted to commercial uses permitted by right or as a conditional
use in the B-1 district, including the required parking and any other
accessory uses.



   B.   Commercial PUD/shopping centers, permitted under the provisions
of this section in all the B and I districts, may include any use permitted
or as a conditional use as a principal or accessory use in the B district.



   C.   Industrial PUDs, permitted under the provisions of this section
in the I district, may include any use permitted by right or as a conditional
use as a principal or an accessory use in the I-1 or I-2 districts.



   D.   The particular uses included in a proposed PUD are subject to
the review and approval procedures specified herein, and shall not be deemed
to be permitted by right.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 2, 1980).



17.76.040  Minimum size.



   Minimum size is as follows:



   A.   Industrial/residential: In order to qualify as an industrial or
residential PUD, the parcel of land to be developed must comprise a total
area of two hundred thousand square feet of contiguous land under single
ownership, or with the consent of the owners of all land to be included.
However, on any lot or group of adjoining lots recorded prior to November 1,
1980, PUD is permitted if:



      1.   The lot or lots are surrounded on all sides by public
streets, alleys, or other public land; or



      2.   The lot or lots comprise one acre or more in area with a
minimum dimension of two hundred feet.



   B.   Commercial: A commercial PUD/shopping center may fall into the
three following size classifications:



      1.   General, minimum of four acres and a combined building
area of fifty thousand square feet;



      2.   Convenience, minimum of one acre and having between
twelve thousand and fifty thousand square feet of combined building area;

   Procedure for PUD submission and approval with the exception of
neighborhood commercial PUD which is treated as a conditional use. The
designation and approval of an area as a PUD shall be accomplished in
accordance with the procedures indicated herein.

(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 5(B), 1980).



17.76.080  Preliminary development plan-Review.



   A.   Upon receipt of the PUD application and the material required
to be presented, and the payment of the applicable fees, the chairman of the
plan commission shall schedule, and the plan commission shall hold, a public
hearing in accordance with the procedures for considering a conditional use.
Within thirty days after completing the public hearing, the plan commission
shall recommend approval or disapproval, or, at the request of the applicant,
continue discussion pertaining to the preliminary development plan. The plan
commission shall consider the proposed PUD in accordance with the definitions
and goals of this section and the minimum requirements set forth in this
section.



   B.   The plan commission shall forward to the city council the
preliminary development application and the preliminary development plan,
together with its recommendation thereon. The recommendation may include
revisions in, additions to, or deletions from the application and development
plan submitted by the applicant.



   C.   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to submit a
reproducible copy of the preliminary development plan as approved by the plan
commission. Such a plan shall incorporate all revisions approved by the plan
commission, and shall be submitted to them for their final review and
approval before being forwarded to the city council. In the event that a PUD
would require a change of zoning, then an application for such a change may
be submitted in conjunction with the PUD application, to be considered
simultaneously with the PUD proposal, in accordance with the procedures for
amending this title; provided, however, that the required change of zoning
shall not be granted except in conjunction with approval by the city council
of the final development plan of the PUD. If no construction has begun or no
approved use has been established in the PUD within one year from the date of
approval of the change of zoning and of the final development plan by the
city council, the change of zoning, as well as the approval of the final
development plan, shall lapse and be void and no longer in effect.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 5(C), 1980).



17.76.090  Preliminary development plan-Approval.



   A.   Approval of the preliminary development plan by the city
council shall constitute approval of the basic provisions and outlines of the
plan, and approval of the representation and provisions of the applicant
regarding the plan. Approval shall not be construed as an implied waiver of
any matter. A waiver of any requirement shall be expressed in written form.
Council approval shall be valid for six months from the date of passage of
the ordinance; the city council may at its discretion extend for an
additional six months the validity of the preliminary approval.



   B.   In approving a preliminary development plan, the city council
may include revisions in, additions to, or deletions from the application and
development plan submitted by the applicant, or from those recommended by the
plan commission. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to submit a
reproducible copy of the preliminary development plan as approved by the city
council, and sign if this plan differs in any respect from that recommended
by the plan commission. A reproducible copy shall be submitted to the mayor
for his signature.



   C.   In case of a written protest against any proposed PUD, signed
by the owners of forty percent of the lots any part of which are included
within the area defined by a line extended two hundred fifty feet outward in
all directions from the perimeter of the PUD, filed with the city clerk prior
to the commencement of the meeting of the city council at which a vote on the
proposed PUD is taken, the approval shall not be granted except by a
favorable vote of two-thirds of the members of the city council then holding
office and not abstaining from voting on the question. For the purposes of
Sections 17.76.050 through 17.76.150, if any lot or property seeking to
protest has multiple owners, such lot shall be counted as protesting if at
least fifty percent of all owners of such lot signed the protest document.
The protest document need not be acknowledged, but shall bear the signatures
and common street address of those signing such document, and identify the
property which each signator owns. For purposes of this section, the
perimeter of the subject lot shall be considered to be the properly line of
the lot of land, excluding any land within a public dedicated right-of-way,
and excluding any land lying within a railroad right-of-way; the owner of
property shall be considered to be any of the following: the record owner of
the fee title, the contract seller, and the contract buyer of such property.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 5(D), 1980).



17.76.100  Final development plan-Submission.



   While the preliminary approval is still valid, the applicant shall file
with the plan commission the final development plan, including the original
and twelve copies of the final development plan, containing all information,
plans, and data required herein for the entire area of the PUD given
preliminary approval. The final PUD plan shall include but not be limited to
the following:

(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 5(E), 1980).



17.76.110  Final development plan-Review.



   Upon receipt of the final PUD development plan, the plan commission
shall review the submitted documents, and ascertain whether the final plans
substantially conform to the approved preliminary development plan and the
provisions of this section. Upon review of the final development plan, the
plan commission shall forward to the city council its recommendation, the
final plan, and any necessary supporting information.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 5(F), 1980).



17.76.120  Final development plan-Approval.



   A.   The city council shall consider the final development plan and
the recommendation thereon of the plan commission, and shall vote whether or
not to approve the plan. In case of a written protest against the proposed
PUD at this stage, the provisions of Section 17.76.090 shall apply.



   B.   Upon approval by duly enacted ordinance of the final
development plan by the city council, the city clerk, upon direction of the
applicant and receipt of the recording fees from the applicant, shall record
the final development plan and all dedications, covenants, and such other
documents as may be required by the city. The final development plan, as
approved by the city council, shall be recorded within six months following
passage of the ordinance approving said final development plan; if not so
recorded, the approval thereof shall be automatically withdrawn and held for
naught.



   C.   After the city clerk has received official written notice of
the recording of the necessary documents, he shall notify the zoning
administrator so that a conditional use permit may be issued. The zoning
administrator shall then issue a conditional use permit for the PUD according
to the approved plan. No construction shall begin upon such project until the
provisions of Sections 17.76.050 through 17.76.150 are met, along with all
other applicable city codes and ordinances.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 5(G), 1980).



17.76.130  Final development approval-Phases.



   The final development approval may be granted in phases as approved by
the city council. Each final development approval of a phase shall be
recorded in the same manner as a final development approval of the entire PUD.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 5(H), 1980).



17.76.140  Conformance to development schedule-Extensions.



   The applicant shall conform to the development schedule as required in
this chapter. If no construction has begun or no approved use has been
established in the PUD within one year from the date of approval of the final
development plan by the city council, the approval of the final development
plan shall lapse, and be void and no longer in effect. At its discretion and
for good cause, the city council may by ordinance extend for one additional
year the period for the beginning of construction, the establishment of an
approved use, or completion of a phase of development as indicated in the
development schedule. If a final development plan lapses under the provisions
of Sections 17.76.050 through 17.76.150, the zoning administrator shall so
notify the applicants, at the address given on the plan submittal.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 5(1), 1980).



17.76.150  Abandonment of PUD -Lapsing of PUD approval.



   Once the final development plan for a PUD is recorded, if the
petitioner desires to abandon and vacate such final development plan, the
petitioner shall petition Hoopeston city council for the passage of an
ordinance vacating such final development plan. In considering such a
request, the city council may consult the Hoopeston plan commission. If such
an ordinance is passed, the city clerk shall record such vacation ordinance
with the county recorder, with the recording fee to be paid by the
petitioner. Unless such vacation is approved by the city council and duly
recorded, no construction shall be undertaken or use established on the
property included in the PUD, except in accordance with the approved PUD plan.



   If the final approval of a PUD lapses under the provisions of this
section, the city council shall pass an ordinance declaring such PUD final
development plan null and void under the terms of this section, and shall
direct the city clerk to record said vacation ordinance.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 5(J), 1980).



17.76.160  General review criteria.



   The plan commission's review of the PUD preliminary and final
applications and development plans and the commission's recommendations to
the city council shall be based on the following general criteria;

development is completed to present no health or safety hazards to the
occupants. No certificate of occupancy for a commercial use in a residential
PUD shall be issued until at least twenty-five percent of the total
residential floor space is built and certificates of occupancy therefor have

   No changes may be made in the final development plan during the
construction of a PUD, except upon application to the appropriate agency
under the procedures provided below:



   A.   Minor changes in the location, siting, and height of buildings
and structures may be authorized, in writing, by the zoning administrator, if
required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the
final plan was approved. No amendment to the approving ordinance shall be
needed in such cases. No changes authorized by this subsection may cause any
of the following:

procedure established for the recording of the initial final plan documents.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVIII § 8(C), 1980).



17.76.210  Changes in ownership of PUD -Changes in development
schedule-Violations.



   A.   If the ownership of any parcel of land included within a PUD
application changes after the application has been submitted, but prior to
approval of the preliminary plan of the PUD by the city council, the new
owner of the property shall be regarded as excluded from the application
unless the new owner affirmatively joins in the application for the PUD.



   B.   If the ownership of any parcel of land included within a PUD
application changes after approval of the preliminary plan but prior to the
approval of the final development plan by the city council, then the new
owner shall be regarded as subject to and joining in the preliminary plan,
unless the new owner notifies the secretary of the plan commission in writing
of such owner's desire to be excluded from the preliminary plan.



   C.   If any parcel of land included within the PUD has a change of
ownership after final approval of the PUD by the city council, then such
owners shall take the land subject to all of the conditions and requirements
as set forth in the final development plan as approved, and the applicable
portions of this title.

   17.80.060   Conditions of issuance-Registration.



17.80.010  Purpose-Uses described. 



   The development and execution of the zoning title is based upon the
division of the city into districts, within any one of which the use of land
and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures, as
related to the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however, that
there are special uses which, because of their unique character, cannot be
properly classified into any particular district or districts without
consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands
and upon the public need for the particular use of the particular location. 
Such conditional uses fall into two categories:



   A.   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly regulated
utilities, or uses traditionally affected with a public interest;



   B.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that
the operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact
upon neighboring property or public facilities.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVII § 7(A), 1980).



17.80.020  Authorization procedure. 



   Conditional uses shall be authorized only by the city council, provided
that no application for a conditional use shall be acted upon by the city
council until after a public hearing is scheduled and notice posted, and
thereafter held by the plan commission and its findings and recommendations
are reported to the city council.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVII § 7(B), 1980).



17.80.030  Application filing and processing. 



   An application for conditional use shall be filed with the chairman or
secretary of the plan commission, or the office of the mayor.  The chairman
or secretary of the plan commission shall process such application in
accordance with law, give notice of the public hearing and after the public
hearing is held, forward the recommendation of the plan commission to the
city council for final action.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVII § 7(C), 1980)



17.80.040  Standards and requirements generally. 



   No conditional use shall be granted by the city council unless the
special use:



   A.   Is deemed necessary for the public convenience at that location;



   B.   Is so designed, located, and proposed to be operated that the
public health, safety, and welfare will be protected;



   C.   Will not cause substantial injury to the value of the property
in the neighborhood in which it is located; and,



   D.   Falls generally within the parameters established in Section
17.52, principal uses permitted, Table One.



(Ord. 92-26, 1992; Ord. 81-11 Art. XVII § 7(D), 1980).



17.80.050  Conditions of issuance-Restrictions may be imposed. 



   The plan commission may recommend and the city council may provide such
conditions and restrictions upon the construction, location, and operation of
a conditional use, including, but not limited to, location of points of
vehicular ingress and egress, off-street parking and loading, and building
setbacks, as may be deemed necessary to promote the general objectives of
this title, and to minimize any injury to the value of property in the
neighborhood.  Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions as may
have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of the permit for
such conditional use.



   The conditional use permit shall be granted only to the present owner
of the property and shall only be in effect for the length of time the
applicant retains ownership of the said property.  If the property transfers
ownership, the conditional permit shall become null and void and a new
conditional permit must be acted upon by the city council before the
conditional use is allowed to continue.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVII § 7(E), 1980).



17.80.060  Conditions of issuance-registration. 



   After a conditional use has been granted by the city council, all
conditional uses, including home occupations, shall register annually at the
city offices, in January of each and every year, or as soon after the
granting of a conditional use by the city council as is possible, providing
the city with the address of the conditional use, the nature of the
conditional use, the persons involved with the conditional use, including
home occupation, and a certification that the conditional is in compliance
with the conditions of issuance of the city.  Failure to so register the
conditional use as set forth in this section, shall constitute a revocation
of the permit for such conditional use, and a new conditional use permit must
be acted upon by the Plan Commission and the city council before the
conditional use is allowed to continue.  In addition, the continued
utilization of the premises for the conditional use in violation of these
provisions herein set forth shall be further subject to the penalties and
remedies set forth in Section 17.96.

17.84.010  Purpose. 



   The board of appeals may recommend variations of the provisions of this
title in harmony with its general purpose and intent and may recommend them
only in specific instances as set forth in this chapter.



   The board of appeals, based on standards prescribed in this chapter and
after hearing, may recommend, by a majority vote of all members of the board
of appeals, that there are practical difficulties or particular hardship in
the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this title.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVII § 3(A), 1980).



17.84.020  Requirements and standards generally. 



   A.   The board of appeals may recommend to vary the provisions of
this title as authorized in this section, but only when it has made findings
based upon the evidence presented to it in the following specific cases:



      1.   That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable
return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the
regulations governing the district in which it is located;



      2.   That the plight of the owner is due to unique
circumstances; or



      3.   That the variation, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the locality.



   B.   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the board
of appeals shall also in making this recommendation whether there are
practical difficulties or particular hardship, take into consideration the
extent to which the following facts favorable to the applicant have been
established by the evidence:



      1.   That the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved would bring a
particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulation were to be carried out;



      2.   That the conditions upon which the petition for variation
is based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same
zoning classifications;



      3.   That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been
created by any person having an interest in the property at any time after
the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title;



      4.   That the granting of the variation will not be
detrimental to the public welfare in the neighborhood in which the property
is located; or



      5.   That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate
supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the
danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public safety, or substantially
diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.



   C.   The board of appeals may require such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises to be benefited by a variation as may be
necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this chapter to reduce or
minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the
neighborhood, and to implement the general purpose and intent of this title.
Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions as may have been imposed
shall constitute grounds for revocation of such variations.



(Ord. 81-11 Art. XVII § 3(B), 1980).



17.84.030  Request processing procedure.



   No variation shall be recommended by the board of appeals except after
a public hearing before the board of appeals of which there shall be a notice
of the time and place of the hearing published at least once not more than
thirty nor less than fifteen days before the hearing in one or more
newspapers with a general circulation within Hoopeston, and that a written
notice is served at least fifteen days before the hearing on the owners of
the properties located adjacent to the location for which the variation is
requested. The recommendation of the board of appeals shall then be forwarded
to the city council for their action.
