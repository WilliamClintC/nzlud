SUPPLEMENTATION
The Palisade, Colorado Municipal Code, originally published by Colorado Code Publishing Company, will be kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest.
Supplements to this Code provide periodic updating through the removal and replacement of pages. This inter-leaf supplementation system requires that each page which is to be removed and replaced is identified so that the updating may be accurately accomplished and historically maintained.
Instructions for supplementation are provided for each supplement, identified by Supplement number, date and inclusive ordinance numbers. The Instructions for posting the removal and replacement of pages must be followed and accomplished in sequence, with the most recent supplementation posted last .
When supplementation is completed and the removal and replacement of all pages are accomplished, the Instructions should be placed under the Supplementation tab, behind this page, with the most recent Instruction sheet on top. Previous Instructions should not be removed, so that the user may refer to this tab section to verify whether the code book is fully updated with all supplements included.
The maintenance of a Municipal Code with all supplementation is an important activity which deserves close attention so that the value of the code is maintained as a fully comprehensive compilation of the legislative ordinances of the municipality.

PREFACE
The Town of Palisade, a statutory town, has published its Municipal Code in a format which features the following:
The Table of Contents is the table containing each chapter and article title, with reference to page location. Preceding each chapter is a chapter table of contents, also identifying each article by the subject name provided.
The two-place section numbering system places the chapter number first, followed by a hyphen and section number. This two-place system is simplified by the elimination of article numbering. Each section may be cited by the chapter and section numbers which, together with reserved section numbers, are in sequence within each chapter.
The open chapter and page numbering system creates reserved chapter and page numbers for expansion or revision of the code without undue complication when changes are made to the code by supplementation.
The Disposition of Ordinances Table identifies the source for the contents of the code. This table provides ordinance numbers in chronological order and location by section number for the present code contents. Thus, if there is interest in determining whether an ordinance, or a portion thereof, is contained within the code, the Disposition of Ordinances Table will provide that information. The Table of Up-to-Date Pages lists all of the current pages through the most recent supplementation.
The Index provides references by common and legal terminology to the appropriate code sections. Cross references are provided with the Index when appropriate.
Supplements to the code provide regular updating of the code to maintain it as a current compilation of all the legislation which has general and continuing effect. Without regular supplementation, the code would soon lose its usefulness as a complete source of the general law of the municipality. Supplementation is accomplished by the periodic publication of additions and amendments to the code.

CHAPTER 6 Business Licenses and Regulations

Sec. 6-132. Violations; penalty.
Sec. 6-100. Purpose.
The Board of Trustees intends to regulate the use, acquisition, production and distribution of recreational marijuana in a manner consistent with the Section 16 of Article XVIII of the Colorado Constitution ("Retail Marijuana Amendment") and in accordance with the Colorado Retail Marijuana Code, Article 43.4 of Title 12, C.R.S. (the "Colorado Retail Marijuana Code") and regulations adopted by the State of Colorado thereunder.
1. The Colorado Retail Marijuana Code, Article 43.4 of Title 12, C.R.S., imposes statewide regulations pertaining to the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale of retail marijuana and for the licensing of retail marijuana business establishments. Such legislation also permits local licensing of such establishments. However, the State law is not intended to, and does not, address the local impacts of marijuana operations, making it appropriate for local regulation of marijuana establishments.
2. The use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession and transportation of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and marijuana is still classified as a "Level 1 Controlled Substance" under federal law. Nothing within this Article is intended to promote or condone the production, use, sale or distribution of retail or recreational marijuana other than in compliance with applicable local and State law and the Colorado Constitution.
3. This Article is not intended to regulate medical marijuana businesses which are governed by Article IV of the Palisade Municipal Code.
4. This Article is to be construed to protect the interests of the public over marijuana business interests. Operation of a retail marijuana business establishment is a revocable privilege and not a right within the Town. There is no property right for an individual to have a business to sell marijuana within the Town of Palisade.
5. The purpose of this Article V is to implement the Recreational Marijuana Amendment in a manner consistent with the Colorado Retail Marijuana Code to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Town by prescribing the time, place and manner in which retail marijuana businesses may be operated within the Town. In addition, the purpose of this Article is to:
a. Provide for the safe sale of retail and recreational marijuana to persons legally permitted to obtain, possess and use marijuana for recreational purposes in accordance with the Recreational Marijuana Amendment.
b. Protect public health and safety through reasonable limitations on business operations as they relate to noise, air quality, food safety, public safety, security for the businesses and their personnel, and other health and safety concerns.
c. Impose fees in an amount sufficient to cover the direct and indirect cost to the Town of licensing and regulating retail marijuana establishments.
d. Allow retail marijuana stores, retail marijuana cultivation facilities, retail marijuana product manufacturing facilities and retail marijuana testing facilities to operate in compliance with this Article V.
e. Facilitate the implementation of the Recreational Marijuana Amendment without going beyond the authority granted by such Amendment.
(Ord. 2017-14, §1)

No retail marijuana establishment shall be located in the designated Retail Marijuana Free Zone in the downtown core of Palisade as identified in the Retail Marijuana Free Zone Map contained in the Town's Land Use and Development Code. If an applicant has not yet received a conditional use permit to operate a retail marijuana establishment, a license may be granted conditioned upon such conditional use permit being granted.

The questioning of a person by the licensee or an employee does not render the licensee or the employee civilly or criminally liable for slander, false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, or unlawful detention.
e) Any sale of retail marijuana by a retail marijuana store shall be made in person, directly to the purchaser, within the restricted area of the retail marijuana store. No sale shall be made by a telephone, internet or other means of remote purchase. Delivery shall occur only in person to the purchaser at the time of purchase within the restricted area of the retail marijuana store.
f) Drive in or drive through retail marijuana store facilities shall not be permitted.
g) All retail marijuana sold or otherwise distributed by the licensee shall be packaged and labeled in a manner that advises the purchaser that it contains marijuana, specifies the amount of marijuana in the product, and that the marijuana is intended for use solely by a person lawfully possessing retail marijuana. The label shall be in compliance with all applicable requirements of the State of Colorado.
h) Retail marijuana stores shall provide customers with the contact information for local drug abuse treatment centers as well as educational materials regarding the hazards of substance abuse.

k) Any person who fails to comply with a notice of violation shall be subject to any of the following:
1) The Town Administrator may issue a stop work order to the owner and contractors on a construction site, by posting the order at the construction site. Unless express written exception is made, the stop work order shall prohibit all further construction activity at the

CHAPTER 7 Health, Sanitation and Animals

a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 223(a) and (b) of the Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure, or any other provision of law, the right of a jury trial shall not be available at a hearing where the cited person is charged with a non-criminal traffic offense. In addition, no person charged with a non-criminal traffic offense shall be afforded the right of Court-appointed counsel.
b) The Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure shall apply to any hearing where the cited person is charged with a non-criminal traffic offense, unless any of the rules are clearly inapplicable. The burden of proof shall be upon the People beyond a reasonable doubt.
c) An appeal from final judgment on a non-criminal traffic offense shall be made in accordance with Rule 237 of the Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure and Article 10, Title 13, C.R.S.
d) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no person against whom a judgment has been entered for a non-criminal traffic offense shall collaterally attack the validity of that judgment unless such attack is commenced within three (3) months after the date of entry of the judgment. The only exceptions to the time limitations shall be:
1) A case in which the Court entering judgment did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the alleged infraction.
2) A case in which the Court entering judgment did not have jurisdiction of the person of the violator.
3) Where the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the failure to seek relief within the applicable time period was caused by an adjudication of incompetence or by commitment of the violator to an institution for treatment as a mentally ill person; or
4) Where the Court finds that the failure to seek relief within the applicable time period was the result of circumstances amounting to justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.
e) At any time that a person is cited for the commission of any non-criminal traffic offense, the citing officer shall give a notice to the person in charge of or operating the motor vehicle involved, which notice shall be in the form of a Penalty Assessment Notice.
f) The Penalty Assessment Notice tendered by the citing officer shall contain the name and address of such person, the license number of the vehicle involved, if any, the number of such person's driver's license, the nature of the offense, the amount of the penalty prescribed for such offense, the date of the Notice, the time and place and when and where such person shall appear in Court in the event such penalty is not paid, and a place for such person to execute a signed acknowledgment of liability and an agreement to pay the penalty prescribed within twenty (20) days as well as such other information as may be required by law to constitute such Notice as a Summons and Complaint to appear in Court, should the prescribed penalty not be paid within the time period.
g) One (1) copy of the Notice shall be given to the alleged violator by the citing officer.
h) The time specified in the Notice to appear shall be at least twenty-one (21) days, but not more than forty-five (45) days after such citation, unless the person cited shall demand an earlier hearing.
i) Whenever the alleged violator refuses to sign or accept the Penalty Assessment Notice, tender of such Notice by the citing officer to the alleged violator shall constitute service of a Summons and Complaint.
j) In the event a person who has been cited for a non-criminal traffic offense fails to pay the penalty assessment within the time period specified in the Penalty Assessment Notice, he/she shall make an appearance and answer the Complaint against him/her. If the alleged violator answers that he/she is liable, judgment shall be entered against him/her, and he/she shall be assessed the appropriate penalty on the Complaint and if he/she denies liability, a trial shall be held within the time period prescribed in Rule 248 of the Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure. If the alleged violator fails to appear for a final hearing, a default judgment shall be entered against him/her, and he/she shall be assessed the appropriate penalty and applicable Court costs.
k) In the event a person who has been cited for a non-criminal traffic offense fails to pay the penalty assessment within the time period specified in the Penalty Assessment Notice and fails to appear at the time and place specified in the Notice a default judgment shall be entered against him/her, and he/she shall be assessed the appropriate penalty and Court costs. The Clerk of the Municipal Court may proceed to collect this judgment as provided by law, and shall certify the same to the Department of Revenue as provided in Section 42-4-1709(7), C.R.S.
l) A Police Officer coming upon an unattended vehicle which is an apparent violation of any provision of the Model Traffic Code may place upon the vehicle a penalty assessment notice indicating the non-
CHAPTER 8 Vehicles and Traffic
Page 165
criminal traffic offense and directing the owner/operator of the vehicle to remit the penalty assessment to the Municipal Court within twenty (20) days. If the penalty assessment is not paid within twenty (20) days of the issuance of such notice, the Court shall mail a notice to the registered owner of the vehicle, setting forth the non-criminal traffic offense and the time and place where it occurred and directing the payment of the penalty assessment within twenty (20) days from the issuance of the notice. If the penalty assessment is not paid within twenty (20) days from the date of mailing of such notice, the Court shall request the Police Officer who issued the original penalty assessment notice to file a complaint with the Court and issue and serve upon the registered owner of the vehicle a summons to appear in Court at a time and place specified therein.
m) If the alleged violator is cited for a non-criminal traffic offense, he or she shall be privileged to answer the complaint made against him or her in the manner provided in the Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure. The maximum penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed the penalty set forth in the penalty assessment notice.
n) The provisions of this Section shall not apply to violations specified in Section 8-6(b), nor shall they apply when it appears that the alleged violator has, in the course of the same transaction, violated one (1) of the provisions referred to in Section 8-6(b), and has also violated one (1) or more of the other provisions of the Model Traffic Code.
o) If a person receives a Penalty Assessment Notice for a violation under this Article I and such person pays the fine and surcharge for the violation on or before the date the payment is due, the points assessed for the violation are reduced as follows, in the manner and to the extent permitted by Sections 42-2-127(5.5) and (5.6), C.R.S.

Sec. 8-8. Procedure for parking violations.
a) Whenever any motor vehicle without a driver is found parked or stopped in violation of any of the parking, standing or stopping provisions of the Model Traffic Code, the officer finding such vehicle shall take its registration number and any other information displayed on the vehicle which may identify its user and shall conspicuously affix to the vehicle a penalty assessment notice directing the driver to respond and answer the charge at a place and time specified in said notice.
b) In any prosecution charging a violation of any provision of this Article, proof that the vehicle described in the notice was parked or stopped in violation of such provision, together with proof that the defendant named in the notice was at the time of such violation the registered owner of the vehicle, shall constitute prima facie evidence that the registered owner was the person who parked or stopped the vehicle at the time and place of the violation.
c) In addition to any other liability provided for in the Model Traffic Code, the owner of a motor vehicle who is engaged in the business of leasing or renting motor vehicles is liable for payment of a parking violation fine unless the owner of the leased or rented motor vehicle can furnish sufficient evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the parking violation, in the care, custody or control of another person. To avoid liability for payment, the owner of the motor vehicle is required, within a reasonable time after notification of the parking violation, to furnish to the Town Prosecutor the name and address of the person or company who leased, rented or otherwise had the care, custody or control of such vehicle. As a condition to avoid liability for payment of a parking violation, any person or company who leases or rents motor vehicles to another person shall attach to the leasing or rental agreement a notice stating that, pursuant to the requirements of this Article, the operator who has the care, custody or control of the motor vehicle is liable for parking citations. The notice shall inform the operator that the operator's name and address shall be furnished to the Town Prosecutor of the Town when a parking violation fine is incurred by the operator.
d) Any person charged with a parking, stopping or standing violation under the Model Traffic Code for which a penalty assessment notice may be issued and for which payment of a fine may be made to the Municipal Court shall have the option of paying such fine within the date, time and at the place specified in said notice upon entering a plea of guilty and upon waiving appearance in Court; or may
CHAPTER 8 Vehicles and Traffic
Page 166
have the option of depositing any required lawful bail, and upon a plea of not guilty shall be entitled to a trial to the Court before the Municipal Judge.
e) Payment of a penalty assessment notice by the person to whom the notice is tendered shall constitute an acknowledgment of guilt by such person of his or her violation of the offense stated in such notice.
f) Payment of the prescribed fine shall be deemed a complete satisfaction for the violation, and the Municipal Court, upon accepting the prescribed fine, shall issue a receipt to the violator acknowledging payment thereof. A check tendered and accepted and on which payment is received shall be deemed sufficient.
(Ord. 2013-13 §1)
Sec. 8-9. Interpretation.
This Article shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to conform with the State's uniform system for the regulation of vehicles and traffic. Section headings of this Article and the adopted Model Traffic Code shall not be deemed to govern, limit, modify or in any manner affect the scope, meaning or extent of the provisions of any article or section thereof.
(Ord. 2013-13 §1)

As deemed necessary by Public Safety and Planning the Town of Palisade will establish a uniform system for street naming and addressing procedures for new developments and as needed for existing properties with no known address or with addressing inconsistencies. Addressing should be done in a way that encourages efficient and timely delivery of services such as police, fire, ambulance, and mail and other deliveries; a community sense of location; and ease of navigation for visitors and new comers. Any and all parcels, buildings and structures which may be constructed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Article in the Town shall be subject to the provisions of this Article, and numbered in the manner herein prescribed. From time to time the Town of Palisade will review existing addresses and may be required to update those existing addresses to meet these standards.

(Ord. 2014-05, §1)
Sec. 11-72. Numbering required; placement restrictions.
It is hereby made the duty of every owner or his or her agent or the occupant of any parcel, building or structure situated in the corporate limits of the Town to number the same within thirty (30) days after being notified to do so by the Town Clerk, in the manner hereinafter directed, and by securely fastening a metal plate or sign bearing the figures necessary to indicate the proper number of any said parcel, building or structure in a prominent place, whichever shall be the most visible from the street upon which such parcel, building or structure fronts.
(Ord. 2014-05, §1)
Sec. 11-73. Numbering system described.
The proper number to be affixed to any such parcel, building or structure shall be ascertained in the following manner, to wit:
1. Beginning at that certain street in Town known as Main Street, as a base point, and proceeding easterly and westerly from Main Street, all parcels, buildings and structures fronting upon streets running at right angles therewith shall be numbered in accordance with what is known as the decimal system, and by regularly increasing numbers, according to the distance easterly or westerly from said Main Street, allowing one (1) number to each twelve and one-half (12½) feet of space in each block, exclusive of alleys.
2. Parcels, buildings and structures situated upon Main Street, and upon all other streets running parallel or nearly parallel therewith, shall be numbered by the same method and in the same manner, using that certain street in the Town known as First Street as a base point, and proceeding northerly and southerly therefrom.
3. Numbers in each block shall begin with 100 and 101, 200 and 201, 300 and 301, etc., according to whether the same is the first, second or third, etc., block from the streets designated as base points. On all streets or avenues running northerly and southerly, even numbers shall be placed on the west side of the street, and on streets and avenues running easterly and westerly, even numbers shall be placed on the north side of the street. The odd numbers in each case shall be placed on the side of the street opposite to that on which the even numbers are to be placed, as aforesaid.
4. Multiple addresses may be assigned per parcel. If this does occur, 911 mapping shall be notified in order for the Address Points map to be updated and the Assessor's Office so the property information is kept current.
5. If there is more than one (1) unit on the parcel a unit number/letter must be assigned. Do not use alpha numeric combinations (i.e. A2, 3B).
6. Unit numbers/letters shall be assigned incrementally increasing with the street numbering.
7. Do not use the "#" symbol in any portion of an address. Use "Unit," "Ste," "Suite," "Trl," "Apt," etc.
8. Accessory buildings or structures shall maintain the same address as the primary parcel, building, or structure and may receive a unit number.
9. The number which, by proper computation and measurement, made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, falls to any parcel, building or structure in the Town, as computed from the official plat of the Town, shall thenceforth be and remain the proper and official number thereof.
10. Notification of a Change of Address/Address Assignment or newly addressed subdivision plat needs to be available to all utilities, districts, and agencies with an interest in said property.
(Ord. 2014-05, §1)
Sec. 11-74. General subdivision and street naming guidelines and standards.
The proper naming of a street or renaming of street shall be ascertained using the guidelines and standards prepared by Public Safety, Planning, in coordination with service-providing agencies (911, post office, GIS, etc.)
1. Do not allow the use of fractions in the street number or street name.
2. Punctuation should not be used in subdivision or street names.
3. All new subdivisions shall be reviewed at both preliminary and final review stages for conformance with street naming conventions and to identify any potential addressing issues (i.e. fractions, duplicate street or subdivision names, loop w/not enough numbers).
CHAPTER 11 Streets, Sidewalks and Other Public Property
Page 234
4. Private streets shall be named and used for addressing; however, private drives/shared drives/auto-courts shall not be named or used for addressing unless no other alternative exists.
5. Do not use special characters in road names (dashes, hyphens, apostrophes).
6. Do not use "North," "South," "East," "West" or street types as a street name (North Crest, South Camp, Court Street, Avenue of Pines Road, North Boulevard).
7. No duplicate names allowed, even across jurisdictions in the urbanized area.
8. If a street name sounds like another name and is spelled different, than a new name must be proposed. (Karla and Carla)
9. Streets that are in alignment and may connect in the future shall use the existing street name even if there is a disruption in the connection. If the connection will never happen due to existing development(s) or physical barrier(s), the name may be, but is not required to be different. Addresses may extend somewhat beyond the grid if needed under the same circumstances as mentioned above.
10. When reviewing a new plat and/or addressing circle or horseshoe roads, it is often easiest to split the road and rename it where it makes a ninety-degree turn or more so that addresses can be assigned without running out of numbers. This will not always be the case, use your best judgment.
11. Streets that make a ninety-degree turn should be renamed if it extends for more than three hundred (300) feet to maintain the integrity of the addressing grid and maximize available numbers.
12. A local road that begins and circles back to terminate on the same road shall be designated as a "circle or loop".
13. “Courts" shall be in alignment with the street that is name after. The best place to make the break from a "Street" to a "Court" is after it has passed over a perpendicular road (intersection). Courts at right angles to a street shall receive a name substantially different from that street.
(Ord. 2014-05, §1)
Sec. 11-75. Material and height of numbers.
The figures used to indicate the number of each house, building or structure in the Town, and to be placed upon the metal plates or signs mentioned in Section 11-72, shall each be at least three (3) inches in height and so inscribed and placed as to be plainly visible from the street upon which the house, building or structure bearing the number is situated.
(Ord. 2014-05, §1)
Sec. 11-76. Time limit for compliance with provisions.
The owner or occupant of any house, building or structure in the Town who is notified as hereinbefore provided of the proper number therefor, shall have thirty (30) days to comply with the provisions of this Article before he or she is subject to any penalty.

b) In the event that the monthly utility bill remains unpaid for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days, water will be shut off to said property. The Town shall work with and make payment arrangements with any customer that is not able to pay all delinquent fees in full. However, in the event that the water is disconnected, all minimum utility fees shall continue to be assessed, and a disconnect/reconnect fee in an amount promulgated by resolution shall be assessed as well. In order for water service to be reinstated, all fees must be paid in full.
c) All rates, fees, charges and assessments provided by this Article II of Chapter 13 of the Palisade Municipal Code, from the time the same shall become due and payable, shall become and remain a lien on the premises until said rates, fees, charges and assessments have been paid to the Town. This lien on the premises may be foreclosed by an action at law or in equity in the name of the Town in any Court having jurisdiction thereof. If the Town must resort to court action for collection of amounts due it under this Article, the Town shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney's fees (including legal assistance fees) and other expenses incurred in such action if the Town prevails. In the event said rates, fees, charges and assessments are not paid when due, the Town Treasurer may file a notice of such lien in the records of the Mesa County Clerk and Recorder. In addition, the Town Treasurer may certify the amount of the same to the Mesa County Treasurer, to be placed on the tax list for the current year and to be collected in the same manner as other taxes are collected, with ten percent (10%) added thereto to defray the cost of collection, pursuant to Section 31-20-105, C.R.S. All laws of this State for the assessment and collection of general taxes, including the laws for the sale of property for taxes and redemption of the same, shall apply.

In such cases, a designee of the Town shall attach a "stop work" order to the construction site in a conspicuous place. Should the Town discover any construction or use of property within the District which is in violation of this Chapter, it shall cause to be attached a "desist" order to the property and attempt to deliver a copy of the same to the owner or occupant of the property. Any "stop work" order or "desist" order shall be signed by the Town Administrator or his or her designees and shall indicate the violations which exist. The removal of a "stop work" order or "desist" order before the violation is corrected is prohibited and, upon conviction, a penalty shall be imposed as provided by this Chapter.

The Town may revoke a permit issued under this Chapter for any violation of these Watershed Regulations, for violation of the permit or any permit condition, or for the provision of false or incorrect information in the permit application. Such revocation shall be preceded by fifteen (15) days' written notice to the permittee that the revocation will occur unless the condition which created the violation or noncompliance with the terms of the permit or permit condition is corrected. The Town may, in its sole discretion and not to be construed as a waiver of any further action, enter into a corrective action plan with the permittee to correct the violation or noncompliance so noted. Upon permit revocation, the Town may require the permittee to restore the site to a condition acceptable to the Town in order to prevent further injury to the District. The Town may, in its discretion, perform or cause to be performed the necessary restoration, and the permittee shall be assessed such costs of restoration.
c) Duration of construction. Unless otherwise specified in the permit, all construction associated with the permitted land use activity shall be completed within one (1) year of the issuance of a permit. Extensions of up to six (6) months each may be granted by the Town upon a showing of good cause.
d) Certificate of compliance. At the completion of construction associated with a land use activity approved under a permit, the applicant shall apply in writing for a certificate of compliance. As soon as reasonably practicable, and not more than twenty (20) days after such request, weather and soil conditions permitting, the Town shall inspect the construction associated with the land use activity and shall determine if these Watershed Regulations, the permit and any permit conditions have been complied with, including but not limited to compliance with all plans and specifications submitted by the applicant or required as a permit condition. If the Town determines that the construction associated with the land use activity conforms to the permit, permit conditions, plan or plans and specifications, and all other required permits or permits incorporated by reference, the Town shall issue a certificate of compliance. If the Town determines that the construction or other activity associated with the permitted land use activity does not conform to the permit, permit conditions, plan or plans and specifications, and all other required permits or permits incorporated by reference, the Town shall not issue a certificate of compliance. In such case, the permittee shall be informed in writing of the reason why the construction or other activity associated with the permitted land use activity does not so conform, and the Town shall also set forth the requirements to be met, as can be practically specified. Thereafter, the process for review for compliance and issuance or denial of a certificate of compliance shall be as set forth herein. It is a violation of this Chapter for any person who is issued a permit for any land use activity within the District to conduct such activity after construction is completed without having complied with the requirement to obtain a certificate of compliance as set forth in this Section.

Up to sixty (60) dwelling units may have hydrants supplied by a dead-end water line when all units are protected by an approved residential fire sprinkler system. In any case, the Fire Chief may require such developments provide for water line connections to adjacent properties to ensure the overall water distribution system meets recognized standards.
(2) Multiple-family residential developments having up to one hundred (100) dwelling units may be protected by fire hydrants supplied by a dead-end water line. Up to two hundred (200) dwelling units may be protected by fire hydrants supplied by a dead-end water line when all units are protected by an approved residential fire sprinkler system. In no case shall such developments be supplied by a dead-end line exceeding one thousand (1,000) feet in length. The Fire Chief may require such developments provide for water line connections to adjacent properties to ensure the overall water distribution system meets recognized standards.
(3) For commercial and industrial developments, any building not exceeding three (3) stories or thirty (30) feet in height may be protected by fire hydrants supplied by a dead-end water line.
(4) For commercial and industrial developments, buildings or facilities having a gross building area up to sixty-two thousand (62,000) square feet may be protected by fire hydrants supplied by a dead-end water line. The gross building area may be increased to one hundred twenty-four thousand (124,000) square feet without a looped water line when all buildings are equipped with an approved automatic fire sprinkler system. In no case shall such developments be supplied by a dead-end line exceeding one thousand (1,000) feet in length. The Fire Chief may require such developments to provide for water line connections to adjacent properties to ensure the overall water distribution system meets looped water line for required fire hydrants, to have a dead-end line as long as the development provides a means to connect to a looped system as future development occurs. The time period and conditions under which this exception is allowed shall be as determined by the Fire Chief.
(5) The Fire Chief may allow fire hydrants to be supplied by other than a looped water line when the permittee can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Fire Chief, that a looped system is not practicable. In such event, the Fire Chief shall make his or her findings in writing and shall copy such findings to the Public Works Foreman and the Town Administrator. In such cases, additional fire protection may be required as determined by the Chief.

Document or Conditional Use shall be considered approval or conditional approval of a "site specific
development plan," as defined in Section 24-68-101, et seq., C.R.S. and shall result in a vested right
for a period of three (3) years as provided in Section 24-68-101, et seq., C.R.S. Within fourteen (14)
days after the final approval of a site specific development plan, the Town Clerk shall publish notice
of the creation of a vested property right as described in Section 24-68-103, et seq., C.R.S. Approved
final plats and site plans approved as part of a site specific development plan shall contain a note

Procedure
1.

Any applicant wishing to extend his or her Vested Rights must submit a request to the Town Board

by law. Any annexation to the Town will require, in writing, the waiver of any pre-existing vested
property rights as a condition of such annexation.

2.

Applicants may request to the Town Board that another stage of development, such as
preliminary plat, be used to hear and confer vested rights. The Town Board may require special
conditions to be met in exchange for early vesting of property rights.

Section 1.05 Transitional Provisions
A. Building Permits
Nothing in this LDC shall require any change in plans, construction, size or designated use of any
building, structure or part thereof that has been granted a building permit prior to the effective date

and conditions of the building permit and proceed to completion in a timely manner as determined
by the Building Official in accordance with applicable Town regulations.
B.

Subdivision Plats
The subdivision standards of this LDC shall not affect any preliminary plat or final plat for which a
complete application was submitted prior to the adoption of this LDC. Such applications shall be
subject to compliance with the standards applicable at the time of the submittal.

C. Violations Continue
Any violation of the previous zoning ordinance or subdivision regulations of the Town shall continue
to be a violation under this LDC and shall be subject to penalties and enforcement under Article 13,
Violations, Penalties and Enforcement, unless the use, development, construction or other activity is
consistent with the express terms of this LDC, in which case enforcement action shall cease, except
to the extent of collecting penalties for violations that occurred before the effective date of this LDC.
D.

Nonconforming Uses Under the Zoning Ordinance
Any (legal) nonconformity under the previous zoning regulations shall also be a legal nonconformity
under this LDC, as long as the situation that resulted in the nonconforming status under the previous
zoning regulations continues to exist. If a nonconformity under the previous ordinances and
regulations becomes conforming because of the adoption of this LDC, then the situation shall no
longer be treated as a nonconformity.

Action following approval
a.

Upon preliminary plat approval, the applicant may initiate proceedings to begin site work
and installation of improvements. Any applicant wishing to exercise this right does so
completely at his or her own risk. The Town shall be held harmless from any costs or
damages in the event the applicant does not ultimately receive final plat approval.
Additionally, the applicant will be required to provide the Town with a performance
guarantee such as a letter of credit or surety performance bond to cover the costs of
reclamation in the event the applicant does not receive final plat approval. Prior to
constructing any necessary public improvements, a complete set of construction
drawings shall be submitted to and approved by the Town Engineer. All work shall be
performed in compliance with the requirements of Article 9, Subdivision Regulations, and
other applicable regulations of the Town and the state.

b.

Approval of a preliminary plat does not constitute approval of the final plat. Application
for approval of the final (record) plat will be considered only after the requirements for
final plat approval as specified in Section 4.05.B, below, have been fulfilled and after all
other specified conditions have been met.

Continuing validity of preliminary plats
a.

Within twelve (12) months of the date of approval of the preliminary plat, the applicant
shall submit a final plat for at least one (1) section of the subdivision; otherwise the
preliminary plat shall be null and void unless the Board of Trustees agrees to an extension
of time. A formal request for extension and reasons thereof must be submitted prior to the
one (1) year deadline date. Extensions may be granted for a period of one (1) year and
may not be granted more than two (2) times.

b.

All sections of an approved preliminary plat must be submitted for final plat approval
within three (3) years of preliminary plat approval for a preliminary plat unless approval for
extension beyond three (3) years has been granted by the Town Board.

Section 4.07 Conditional Use
A. Purpose
In order to provide flexibility and to help diversify uses within a zoning district, specified uses are
permitted in certain districts subject to the granting of a conditional use permit.
B.

Applicability
1.

A conditional use is a use that may or may not be appropriate depending on the location and
the conditions imposed upon the approval of the use that are designed to reasonably mitigate
any adverse impacts upon surrounding properties. Conditional uses may be approved for the
uses indicated in the use regulations of the zoning district of the property for which the
conditional use permit is requested. A pre-existing use that is permitted as a conditional use
pursuant to this LDC shall be deemed to have already received conditional use approval.
Provided, however, that any change or expansion of a conditional use, whether pre-existing or
otherwise, shall require a new conditional use permit pursuant to the terms of this Section.

2.

Conditional uses within each base zoning district are uses that may be appropriate in a particular
district, but because of the increased potential for incompatibility with adjacent uses requires
individual review by the Town Board.

3.

A conditional use permit shall be required for all conditional uses as set forth in the Use Table (see
Section 6.01). A development comprised of uses regulated by separate rows on the table shall
be reviewed using the most restrictive process from among the proposed uses.

4.

Where a use requiring an approval as a conditional use lies on a separate legal lot, only the
building containing the use and its separate lot shall be subject to conditional use review, not
the entire project. However, where the separate legal lot is an outparcel, the application shall
describe the relationship of the outparcel to the remaining site.

C. Initiation
An owner of land within the jurisdiction of the Town (or a duly authorized agent or representative)
may apply for conditional use permit approval.
D.

application:
1.

That the application will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where
proposed and developed according to the plans as submitted and approved.

2.

That the application meets all required specifications and conforms to the standards and

undue hardship.
B.

Applicability
1.

The Board of Adjustment is authorized to grant variances from the dimensional standards and
the off-street parking and loading standards of this LDC, unless a variance is specifically
prohibited for a particular requirement. The granting of a variance shall not be contrary to the
public interest or the purposes of this LDC where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this LDC would result in unnecessary physical (not economic)
hardship to the property owner.

2.

It is the intent of this delegation of power to the Board that no variance shall be granted which
is a use variance and has the practical effect of rezoning property to a higher intensity of use
than the district in which the property is located.

Conditions may be imposed by the Board of Adjustment regarding the location,
character and other features of the proposed building or use as may be deemed by the
Board of Adjustment to protect property values and general welfare of the neighborhood.
Nonconformance with such conditions and safeguards, when part of the terms under
which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this LDC.

Findings of Fact
No variance shall be approved by the Board of Adjustment unless all of the following findings are
made.
1.

There are exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question
because of its shape, size or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in
the same district, or there is a peculiar characteristic of an establishment which makes the
parking and/or loading requirements of this LDC unrealistic.

2.

Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privileges that
are denied to other residents of the district in which the property is located.

3.

A literal interpretation of the provisions of this LDC would deprive the applicant of rights
commonly enjoyed by other residents of the district in which the property is located.

4.

The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this LDC and will not

Section 5.05 Planned Development
A. Authority
Article 67 of Title 24 of the C.R.S., the Planned Unit Development Act of 1972 gives the Town the
authority to authorize Planned Developments, in order to protect public safety, integrity and welfare
while encouraging innovations in residential, commercial and industrial development, more efficient
use of land and incorporating the best features of modern design. Moreover, the Planned
Development option allows a developer to relate the type, design and layout of residential,
commercial and industrial development to the particular site, thereby encouraging preservation of
the site's natural characteristics. Any Planned Development should also be within general conformity
with the Town's Comprehensive Plan.
B.

Purpose
The PD district, is established to accommodate proposals of the same or similar uses to be developed
as integrated units such as offices, commercial or service centers, shopping centers, light industrial,
residential developments or proposals where any appropriate combination of such uses which may
be planned, developed or operated as integral land use units either by a single owner or a
combination of owners. All development in the PD district should include significant open space for
the benefit of residents and occupants of the development and the community. PD district
standards are intended to provide for innovative development that is integrated and compatible
with surrounding land uses and development patterns. The PD district provides for modification of
the otherwise applicable dimensional requirements, as specified in Article 8, in order to accomplish
one (1) or more of the following purposes:
1.

Promote innovative and creative design of residential and nonresidential areas;

2.

Promote flexibility in the placement of structures so as to preserve and take advantage of the
site's unique, natural resource or scenic features and to avoid or mitigate any hazardous area;

3.

Encourage more efficient use of land and public streets, utilities and governmental services;

4.

Preserve open space for the benefit of residents of developments and the community;

5.

Achieve a compatible land use relationship with surrounding areas; or

6.

Promote greater variety in the type and design of buildings and thereby improving the character
and quality of new development.

the purchase or condemnation of narrow strips of land for public utilities or street right-of-way
purposes.
B.

Impervious Surface
The maximum area of the lot that is permitted to be covered by buildings, including both principal
structures and accessory buildings and areas surfaced with bituminous asphalt, concrete or other
material that prevents absorption of stormwater into the ground.
Illustration 5-1: Impervious Surface

C. Building Height
Height shall be determined by the vertical distance in feet between the lowest finished grade
(including finished grade of a basement with direct, at-grade walk-out access) to the top of the
highest roof beam on a flat, shed or mansard roof or the peak of a gable, hip or pitched roof.
Illustration 5-2: Building Height

lot. The following rules apply in calculating the average setback:
a.

Only the setbacks on the lots that abut a side of the subject lot at the street and are on
the same side of the street may be used. Setbacks across the street or along a different
street may not be used; and

5-10 | P a g e

Section 5.06 – Measurements and Exceptions

Illustration 5-5: Setback Averaging

Section 9.12 School Land Dedication (SLD)
A.

Purpose
1.

Every subdivision, planned development, mobile or manufactured home park and multifamily
development which increases the number of permitted residential dwelling units over and
above that approved as of the effective date of this Section shall be required to dedicate land
for school purposes, based on the increased number of approved dwelling units, if the Mesa
County School District No. 51 ("School District") determines that such development includes
within it "suitable school lands" which are necessary for implementing a school plan. If such
development does not contain "suitable school lands," the fee required under Section 9.12.C
shall be paid in lieu of a school land dedication, based upon the increased number of approved
residential dwelling units. The provisions of this Section and Section 9.12.C shall be the exclusive
standards for the dedication of "suitable school lands" and imposition of fees in lieu thereof as
prescribed by Section 9.12.C, and in the event of any conflict between such provisions and any
other provision contained in this Section, the requirements of this Section and Section 9.12.C shall
control.

2.

In the event a dedication of land for school purposes is required under this Section, such
dedication shall be made by the developer at or before the time of approval of the
development. No such approval shall be granted until good and sufficient title to the "suitable
school lands" to be dedicated under this Section, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances
whatsoever, except for current general property taxes and patent reservations, is conveyed or
dedicated to and accepted by the School District.
9-16 | P a g e

Section 9.12 – School Land Dedication (SLD)

B.

Amount
1.

The amount of "suitable school lands" which may be required to be dedicated under this Section
shall be roughly proportional to the additional real property required by the school district for
expansion of existing school facilities and construction of new school facilities to accommodate
enrollment growth from the proposed residential development and the future inhabitants
thereof. Such rough proportionality shall be deemed to be met by the following formula:
a.

2.

Number of dwelling units in the proposed residential development x student generation
fee factor of twenty-three thousandths (.023) = number of acres of suitable school lands
required.

The student generation fee factor is based upon a study conducted by Mesa County School
District No. 51 and referenced in the intergovernmental agreement between Mesa County
School District No. 51 and the Town and may be modified from time to time in the manner
provided in Section 9.12.C.6.c below.

C. Fee In Lieu of School Land Dedication
1.

When required
Except for developments where a school land dedication is required in accordance with Section
9.12.A above or is permitted under Section 9.12.C.4 below or an exemption under Section
9.12.C.3 applies, all residential developments which increase the number of approved dwelling
units over and above the number approved as of the effective date of this Section, shall pay
fees in lieu of SLD in an amount per unit based upon the increased number of dwelling units set
forth in Section 9.12.C.6 hereof. SLD fees shall be collected by the Town for the exclusive use and
benefit of the School District and shall be expended by such school district solely to acquire real
property or an interest in real property reasonably needed for development or expansion of
school sites and facilities or to reimburse the school district for sums expended to acquire such
property or interests. Revenues derived from such fees shall be used only for such purposes.

2.

Payment of SLD fee
a.

No residential development shall be approved until and unless the applicable SLD fee in
effect at the time such approval is applied for has been paid as required by this Section.

b.

The Town may elect to approve a residential development subject to payment of the
required SLD fees pursuant to a deferred payment plan. Provided, however, any deferred

Section 9.12 – School Land Dedication (SLD)

3.

Exemptions
The following shall be exempted from dedication of school lands or payment of the SLD fee:

4.

5.

6.

a.

Subdivisions or other developments containing only nonresidential buildings, other
structures or nonresidential mobile homes;

b.

Subdivisions or other developments containing only nursing homes, adult foster care
facilities or specialized group care facilities; and

c.

Approved residential developments that are subject to recorded covenants restricting
the age of the residents of dwelling units contained within such developments in such a
manner that the dwelling units may be classified as "housing for older persons" pursuant to
the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.

Credits
a.

An applicant for subdivision or other residential development approval who owns other
"suitable school lands" within the same school district may offer to convey such lands to
the district in exchange for credit against all or a portion of the SLD fees otherwise due or
to become due. The offer must be in writing, specifically request credit against fees in lieu
of school land dedication and set forth the amount of credit requested. If the Town and
the school district accept such offer, the credit shall be in the amount of the value of the
"suitable school lands" conveyed, as determined by written agreement between the
Town, the school district and the developer.

b.

Credit against SLD fees otherwise due or to become due will not be provided until good
and sufficient title to the property offered under this Section is conveyed to and accepted
by the school district in which the development is located. Upon such conveyance, the
school district and the Town shall provide the developer with a letter or certificate setting
forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit and a description of the
project or development to which the credit shall be applied.

c.

Credits shall not be transferable from one project or development to another.

Refund of fees paid
a.

Any SLD fee which has not been expended by a school district within five (5) years of the
date of collection shall be refunded, with all accumulated interest, if any, to the person
or entity which paid the fee. Prior to such refund, such amount shall be reduced by an
amount equal to three percent (3%) of the principal amount to be refunded, for the costs
incurred by the Town in the refund of such fee. The Town shall give written notice by first
class mail to the person or entity which paid the fee at the last known address as
contained in the records of the Town or Mesa County Clerk and Recorder. If such person
or entity does not file a written claim for such refund with the Town within ninety (90) days
of the mailing of such notice, such refund shall be forfeited and shall be retained and used
for the purposes set forth in Section 9.12.A.

b.

The Board of Trustees may, upon the school district's request, extend the five (5) year
period of time specified in Section 9.12.C.5.a above upon a showing that such extension
is reasonably necessary in order for the school district to complete or close a purchase
transaction entered into in writing by the district prior to expiration of such period or to give
the district an opportunity to exercise a purchase option it acquired prior to expiration of
such period. Such request shall be made at a public hearing of the Board of Trustees. In
no event shall any extension of time exceed one (1) additional five-year period.

SLD fees—establishment and application
a.

SLD fees shall be collected and held in trust for the use and benefit of the school district.
Such fees shall be expended by the school district to acquire additional real property for
expansion of existing school facilities and construction of new school facilities necessitated
by new residential development in the school district or to reimburse the school district for
sums expended to acquire such property. The amount of the SLD fee shall be based on a
methodology which takes into account the student generation rates of new residential
development, the quantity of land required to build new school facilities on a per pupil
basis and the anticipated cost of acquiring suitable school lands in the school district to
expand existing school facilities and construct new school facilities to accommodate new
residential development without decreasing current levels of educational services.
9-18 | P a g e

Section 9.13 – Open Space Requirement

b.

At the time SLD fees were initially adopted and annually thereafter, the Board of Trustees
shall determine the average cost per acre of "suitable school lands," after a public
hearing. The Town shall give the school district sixty (60) days prior written notice of the
hearing. Such hearing shall consider the school district's long range capital improvement
plans and any other evidence, comments or recommendations submitted by the school
district and the public in making such determination.

c.

The SLD fee shall then be set, by resolution of the Board of Trustees, in accordance with
the following formula:
i.

Cost per acre of suitable school lands within the school district x student generation fee
factor of twenty-three hundredths (.023) = SLD fee per dwelling unit.

ii.

The student generation fee factor may also be modified at the hearing, provided that
either the school district gives notice to the Board of Trustees that it requests such a
modification at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing, or the Board of Trustees adopts
a motion providing for consideration of a modification of said fee factor and its hearing
notice to the school district pursuant to this Section so states. Said hearing shall consider
the school district's school facilities plan currently in place, the methodology and data
supporting the proposed modification and any evidence, comments or
recommendations submitted by the County Community Development Department, the
Town's Planning Department, the school district and interested members of the public.

Section 9.13 Open Space Requirement
A. Purpose
The Board of Trustees declares it is the policy of the Town that dedications of real property for public
parks, open space, recreation and other municipal purposes and/or exactions in the form of
monetary payments shall be required in those instances where the Board of Trustees determines that
a proposed subdivision: (1) will create the need for new public park, open space, recreation or other
municipal facilities; or (2) will result in increased use of existing public park, open space, recreation
or other municipal facilities in such a manner as to require the expansion or eventual replacement
thereof. In those instances, this Section shall be applied to provide a method whereby such
dedication or fee in lieu thereof shall be quantified to assure that a fair and equitable proportionality
is established between the cost of the improvements or facilities, which are attributable to the
proposed subdivision (and which are therefore the responsibility of the developer), and the overall
public cost of the provision of such improvements or facilities. In interpreting and implementing the
provisions of this Section, the Board of Trustees shall give due weight to the needs of the general
public, and especially the residents of the subdivision proposed, so as not to burden
disproportionately the general public and existing residents with costs or expenses to provide public
park, open space, recreation or other municipal facilities and improvements or services, the need
for which are generated by the proposed new development.
B.

Authority to Impose Dedication or Fee Requirements
1.

Pursuant to the provisions of applicable law, authority is hereby specifically granted to the Board
of Trustees, upon the recommendations of the Planning Commission, following a public hearing
before the Planning Commission and the Board of Trustees at the time of preliminary plat review,
in conjunction with any requested subdivision approval to impose public land dedication
requirements or the payment of fees in lieu thereof for public park, open space, recreation or
other municipal purposes.

2.

The Town Board, in its discretion, shall accept or reject any proposed dedication of land to the
Town prior to final approval of a proposed subdivision. Any land dedicated to the Town shall be
free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.

C. Open Space Dedication.
1.

The developer of any residential development of ten (10) or more lots or dwelling units shall
dedicate ten percent (10%) of the gross acreage of the property or the equivalent of 10 percent
of the value of the property. The decision as to whether to accept money or land as required
by this Section shall be made by the Board of Trustees upon the recommendations of the
Planning Commission. Subdivisions with less than ten (10) lots or residential dwelling units are not
required to dedicate ten percent (10%) of the gross acreage of the property or the equivalent
9-19 | P a g e

Section 9.14 – Cluster Subdivisions in AFT District

of ten percent (10%) of the value of the property unless the developer or owner owns land
adjacent to the proposed subdivision, in which case the Board of Trustees, upon the
recommendations of the Planning Commission, shall determine the open space requirement.
2.

For any residential development required to provide open space, the owner shall hire an MAI
appraiser to appraise the property. For purposes of this requirement, the property shall be
considered the total acreage notwithstanding the fact that the owner may develop or propose
to develop the property in filings or phases.

3.

The appraiser’s report shall be submitted to the Town for purposes of determining fair market
value and otherwise determining compliance with this Section. The developer shall pay all costs
of the appraisal. The developer waives any privilege and/or protection that may exist or be
asserted to exist over the details of the appraisal. The appraisal is and shall be considered by the
Town as an open record under the Colorado Open Records Act.

4.

The required dedication and/or payment shall be subject to and made in accordance with this
LDC. The Town may accept the dedication of land in lieu of payment so long as the fair market
value of the land dedicated to the Town is not less than ten percent (10%) of the value of the
property.

5.

As part of any project approval, the developer shall dedicate, at no cost to the Town, public
trails, rights-of-way and waterfront greenbelts/access as designed on and as needed to
implement adopted plans of the Town. If such dedication is claimed to exceed constitutional
standards, the developer shall so request that the Town pay a fair share of the value of such
dedication or waive all or part of such required dedication.

Section 9.14 Cluster Subdivisions in AFT District
A. Intent
The intent of a cluster subdivision is to provide a development alternative to a conventional
subdivision in the AFT district. A cluster subdivision involves placing a cluster of home sites within a
portion of the development site, allowing housing units on smaller lots than those permitted in a
conventional residential subdivision to promote environmental sensitivity, make more efficient use of
the land and provide additional common open space. Development is encouraged in the AFT
district by the Town in the form of these flexible design and maximum density provisions. Other
purposes of a cluster residential subdivision include the following:

B.

1.

To preserve in perpetuity orchards and prime agricultural land, rural character and farming as
an economic activity;

2.

To permit clustering of houses and structures in a manner that will reduce the amount of
infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential
development;

3.

To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation
in residential development;

4.

To promote interconnected, contiguous greenways and corridors throughout the community;
and

5.

To protect scenic views.

Applicability
A cluster residential subdivision is permitted in the AFT district subject to the following standards:

C. Maximum District Density
In no case shall the density of the cluster subdivision exceed the maximum density of the AFT district.
D.

Development Standards
Applicants utilizing the cluster subdivision option shall meet all applicable development standards
as set forth in Article 10, General Development Standards. Applicants shall comply with all other
provisions in this LDC and all other applicable laws.

E.

Dimensional Standards
Applicants utilizing the cluster subdivision option shall meet the following dimensional standards and
shall comply with all other provisions of this LDC and all other applicable laws.

the minimum lot width of the adjoining development or the minimum lot width required by the
zoning district applied to any adjoining undeveloped parcel.

2.

Where narrower lot widths are provided, a Class C buffer shall be provided (see Section
10.03.D.2, Landscaping, Screening and Buffering) along all project boundaries of a cluster
residential subdivision.

Recreation and Open Space Requirements
1.

Applicability
Recreation and open space is an integral part of cluster subdivisions. If a cluster development is
being developed in phases, the amount of recreation and open space shall be computed

Exceptions may be granted by the Planning Commission for items such as trail easements,
mid-block crossings, linear parks/medians, greenways, when their purpose meets the
intent of this Section.

b.

At least sixty percent (60%) of the required recreation and open space shall be in a
contiguous parcel. For the purposes of this Section, contiguous shall include any
recreation and open space bisected by a local, residential street, provided that:
i.

A pedestrian crosswalk is constructed to provide access to the recreation and open
space on both sides of the street; and

ii.

The right-of-way area is not included in the calculation of minimum recreation and open
space required.

c.

The recreation and open space shall adjoin any neighboring areas of recreation and
open space, other protected areas and unprotected natural areas that would be
candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected recreation and open space.

d.

The required recreation and open space shall be directly accessible to the largest
practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Nonadjoining lots shall be provided with
safe, convenient access to the open space (i.e., mid-block connections in logical
locations). No lot within the subdivision should be further than a ¼-mile radius from the
9-21 | P a g e

Section 9.14 – Cluster Subdivisions in AFT District

required recreation and open space. This radius shall be measured in a straight line,
without regard for street, sidewalk or trail connections to the open space.

Section 10.01 – Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements

ARTICLE 10 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
Section 10.01 Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements
A. Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to ensure that adequate off-street parking and loading facilities are
provided for motorized and non-motorized vehicles while minimizing the visual and transportation
impacts created by these facilities.
B.

General Provisions
1.

All existing and proposed development shall provide off-street parking and loading facilities in
accordance with this Section with the following exceptions:
a.

Restriping a parking or other vehicular use area which does not result in a reduction of
parking spaces, any modification to existing off-street parking and loading facilities shall
conform to the requirements of this Section.

b.

Buildings and uses lawfully existing as of the effective date of this LDC may be
redeveloped, renovated or repaired without providing additional off-street parking and
loading facilities, providing there is no increase in gross floor area or change in use of
existing floor area that would increase parking demands, with the following exception:
i.

c.

d.

2.

Where a building or use existed as of the effective date of this LDC and such building or
use is enlarged in gross floor area or impervious area by no more than ten percent (10%)
or two thousand (2,000) square feet, whichever is less, off-street parking and loading
requirements shall not be required.
A change in use shall comply with the requirements of this Section unless:

i.

The building is less than two thousand (2,000) square feet in floor area; or

ii.

The new use has the same parking requirement or a lesser requirement than the previous
one.
In the TC district, the Community Development Director may allow a new use to be
established, even if all off-street parking and loading requirements of this Section cannot
be met for the new use, provided that as much off-street parking and loading as can
reasonably be provided is provided by the use and no foreseeable traffic congestion
problems will be created.

No proposed parking area of six (6) spaces or more shall be developed without an approved
site plan issued in accordance this Section and Section 4.06.

C. Required Off-Street Parking
1.

2.

Calculation of parking ratios
a.

Developments containing more than one (1) use shall provide parking spaces in an
amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses.

b.

Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be rounded up to the
next highest whole number.

c.

The parking space requirements for a use not specifically listed in Table 10.1 shall be the
same as for the listed use deemed most similar by the Community Development Director.
The Community Development Director shall use the criteria in Section 6.02 to determine
how an unlisted use should be treated.

Off-street parking
The following off-street parking ratios shall be applicable to all zoning districts. Where in the
opinion of the applicant, a listed ratio requires too much or too little parking, the applicant may
provide an alternative parking plan with data submitted in support of higher or lower ratios (see

Section 10.11 – Transportation Impact Fee

Section 10.11 Transportation Impact Fee
A. Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to require impact-generating development bear a proportionate share
of the cost of improvements to the Town's Major Street System; to require that the proportionate
share does not exceed the cost of providing such street improvements; and to require that funds
collected from impact-generating development are actually used to construct major street system
improvements. Likewise, it is acknowledged that certain development normally classified as impactgenerating can, due to location and design, substantially offset traffic impacts by maximizing the
value of available infrastructure (infill development) and offering alternatives to vehicle travel
(pedestrian-friendly design), both stated goals of the Palisade Comprehensive Plan. It is not the
purpose of this Section to collect any money from any impact-generating development in excess of
the actual amount necessary to offset demands generated by that development for major street
system and regional street system improvements for which the fee is paid.
B.

Time of Fee Obligation and Payment
1.

On or after the effective date of the adoption of this LDC, no planning clearance shall be
approved for any traffic impact-generating development until a transportation impact fee has
been assessed pursuant to the terms of this Section.

2.

The impact fee shall be collected from the applicant for a planning clearance or other trafficgenerating development, such as change of use, before a planning clearance for a building
permit is issued, according to the fee schedule in effect at the time the planning clearance is
applied for.

3.

The developer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Town from all loss or damage which the
Town may suffer, including attorneys' fees and litigation expenses, based upon any claim by the
planning clearance applicant or others that deferral of the impact fee payment is
unenforceable for any reason; and the developer shall be secondarily responsible for the
payment of the applicable impact fee.

C. Exemptions
1.

D.

The following shall be exempt from the terms of this Section. An exemption must be claimed at
the time of submittal of a development application or planning clearance:
a.

Alterations of an existing dwelling unit where no additional dwelling units are created.

b.

Replacement of a destroyed, partially-destroyed or moved residential building or structure
with a new building or structure of the same use and with the same number of dwelling
units.

c.

Replacement of destroyed, partially-destroyed or moved nonresidential building or
structure with a new building or structure of the same gross floor area and use.

2.

The Community Development Director shall determine the validity of any claim for exemption
pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Section.

3.

In order to promote the economic development of the Town or the public health, safety and
general welfare of its residents, the Board of Trustees may agree to pay some or all of the impact
fees imposed on a proposed development or redevelopment from other funds of the Town that
are not restricted to other uses. Any such decision to pay Impact Fees on behalf of an applicant
shall be at the discretion of the Board of Trustees and shall be made pursuant to goals and
objectives articulated by the Board of Trustees.

4.

The Board of Trustees shall reserve the right to credit developers toward their transportation
impact fee obligations in those cases wherein the proposed development can justify a high
degree of pedestrian-friendly design, be located in a recommended infill concentration zone,
or demonstrate a high degree of complementation with these stated goals of the Palisade
Comprehensive Plan.

5.

No waivers shall be granted for any required Impact Fees.

Fee Determination
1.

Every person who applies for a traffic impact-generating development, except those exempted
or preparing an independent fee calculation study, shall pay a transportation impact fee in
accordance with the Town fee schedule prior to approval of the development or prior to the
10-42 | P a g e

Section 10.11 – Transportation Impact Fee

issuance of a planning clearance as set forth in Section 10.11.B, above. If any credit is due
pursuant to Section 10.11.F, the amount of such credit shall be deducted from the amount of
the fee to be paid.

E.

2.

The Town fee schedule will be adopted and updated from time to time by resolution.

3.

If the type of traffic impact-generating development for which a site plan or other development
application is requested is not specified on the above schedule, the Community Development
Director shall determine the fee on the basis of the fee applicable to the most nearly
comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The Community Development Director shall
use the most current edition of the report titled Trip Generation, prepared by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE), or articles or reports appearing in the ITE Journal, as a guide to
selecting a comparable type of land use by trip generation rates.

4.

Impact fees generally are assessed based on the primary land use. If the applicant can
document that an auxiliary land use accounts for over twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross
floor area of the structure and that the auxiliary use is not assumed in the trip generation, then
the impact fees may be assessed based on the individual square footage of the primary and
auxiliary uses.

5.

Existing use or development
a.

If the request is for a change of use or for the expansion, redevelopment or modification
of an existing use, the fee shall be based on the net increase in the fee for the new use as
compared to the previous use.

b.

In the event that the proposed change of use, redevelopment or modification results in a
net decrease in the fee for the new use or development as compared to the previous use
or development, there shall be no refund of impact fees previously paid.

c.

For fees expressed per one thousand (1,000) square feet, the square footage shall be
determined according to gross floor area, measured from the outside surface of exterior
walls, and excludes unfinished basements and enclosed parking areas. The fees shall be
prorated and assessed based on actual floor area, not on the floor area rounded to the
nearest one thousand (1,000) square feet.

Independent Fee Calculation
1.

The impact fee may be computed by the use of an independent fee calculation study at the
election of the applicant by an experienced and knowledgeable consultant approved by the
Town, or upon the request of the Community Development Director, for any proposed traffic
impact-generating development interpreted as not one of those types listed on the fee
schedule or as one that is not comparable to any land use on the fee schedule, and for any
proposed traffic impact-generating development for which the Community Development
Director concludes the nature, timing or location of the proposed development makes it likely
to generate impacts costing substantially more to mitigate than the amount of the fee that
would be generated by the use of the fee schedule.

2.

The preparation of the independent fee calculation study shall be the sole responsibility and
cost of the party electing to utilize the study.

3.

The Community Development Director may require any person who requests an independent
fee calculation study pay an application fee for administrative costs associated with the review
and decision on such study.

4.

The independent fee calculation study shall be based on the same formulas, level of service
standards and unit costs for facilities used in the impact fee study and shall document the
methodologies and assumptions used.

5.

The impact fee shall be calculated according to the formula in the Town Fee schedule that will
be adopted and updated from time to time by resolution.

10-43 | P a g e

Section 10.11 – Transportation Impact Fee

6.

F.

An independent fee calculation study submitted for the purpose of calculating a transportation
impact fee may be based on data, information or assumptions from independent sources,
provided that:
a.

The independent source is an accepted standard source of transportation engineering or
planning data; or

b.

The independent source is a local study on trip characteristics carried out by a qualified
transportation planner or engineer pursuant to an accepted methodology of
transportation planning or engineering that has been approved in advance by the
Community Development Director.

Credits
1.

2.

General standards
a.

Any person initiating traffic impact-generating development may apply for credit against
transportation impact fees otherwise due for payment under the provisions of this Section,
for any dedication or construction for any nondevelopment-related capital street
improvements on the Town's major street system. If all conditions and requirements set
forth in this Section are met, a credit will be issued.

b.

Any person initiating traffic impact-generating development may apply for a credit
against transportation impact fees otherwise due, up to but not exceeding the full
obligation for fees proposed for payment under the provisions of this Section, for any
dedication of land not required by this Code and accepted by the Town, which is not
already decreed, declared, proclaimed or otherwise granted to the Town.

c.

Credits for dedications or construction for nondevelopment-related capital street
improvements on the Town's major street system are transferable only within the same
development or to another development owned by the owner originally receiving the
credit. There shall be no transferable credits associated with any dedication of land.
Credits are not transferable for credit against any other fees required to be paid or
dedications required to be made, including fees and dedications required for other public
facilities.

d.

To be eligible for credits, any person initiating traffic impact-generating development must
enter into an agreement with the Town prior to issuance of development application
approval.

e.

Only a credit may be issued; in no case shall there be a refund of money.

f.

A credit must be used within thirty-six (36) months of the credit agreement.

Non-development-related capital street improvements
a.

Credit against fees
A credit will be in an amount equal to the value of the costs of the street construction at the
time of its completion; or the fair market value of the land dedicated for right-of-way at the
time of dedication. The procedure for credit reviews will be the following:
i.

The determination of any credit will be undertaken upon the submission of an
application for credit agreement, which shall be submitted to the Community
Development Director.

ii.

The application for a credit agreement shall include the following information:
(a) If the proposed application for credit agreement involves construction:
(1) The proposed plan of the specific construction prepared and certified by a duly
qualified and licensed Colorado engineer or contractor;
(2) Complete engineering drawings and specifications for the suggested
improvements. Lane reconstruction, sidewalk construction, medians,
landscaping, street lighting and other ancillary components of a capacityexpanding street improvement shall not be considered system improvements
when not an integral part of a capacity-expanding improvement; and

local information for similar improvements, along with the construction
timetable for the completion thereof. The estimated cost must include the cost
10-44 | P a g e

Section 10.11 – Transportation Impact Fee

of construction or reconstruction, the cost of all labor and materials, the cost of
all lands, property, rights, easements and franchises acquired, costs of plans
and specifications, surveys of estimates of costs and of revenues, costs of
professional services and all other expenses necessary or incident to
determining the feasibility or practicability of such construction or
reconstruction.
(b) If the proposed application involves credit for the dedication of land, the Town will
evaluate the land value for the purpose of the right-of-way dedication. For purposes
of the credit agreement, the applicant must submit:
(1) A drawing and legal description of the land; and
(2) If the applicant disagrees with the right-of-way dedication value amount, the
applicant must provide an appraisal for the fair market value of the land at the
time of the dedication, prepared by a professional real estate appraiser who is
a member of the Member Appraisal Institute (MAI) or who is a member of Senior
Residential Appraisers (SRA).
iii.

The Community Development Director will determine if the application is complete. If it
is determined that the proposed agreement is not complete, the Community
Development Director will send a written statement to the applicant outlining the
deficiencies. The Community Development Director will take no further action on the
proposed application for credit agreement until all deficiencies have been corrected
or otherwise settled.

iv. The application for credit agreement may be approved by the Community
Development Director if it complies with the general standards set forth in this Section.
With respect to an application for right-of-way dedication credits, if the Community
Development Director disagrees with the applicant's appraisal, the Town may conduct
a second appraisal. Any right-of-way dedication credit agreement shall take into
consideration the appraisals conducted. If no agreement can be reached, the Board
of Trustees shall determine the amount of the right-of-way dedication credit.
v.

If the application for credit agreement is approved by the Community Development
Director, the agreement shall be signed by the applicant and the Town. It will specifically
outline the construction or land dedication; the time by which it will be completed,
dedicated or paid and any extensions thereof; and the dollar credit the applicant will
receive for the construction or land dedication. For the purposes of this Section, the
Community Development Director or Mayor is authorized to sign the credit agreement.

vi. The Town shall reserve the right to credit developers toward their Transportation Impact
Fee obligations in those cases wherein the proposed development can justify a high
degree of pedestrian-friendly activity, be located in a designated infill concentration
zone, or demonstrate a high degree of complementation with the stated goals of the
Palisade Comprehensive Plan.
G. Developer's Street Improvements
1.

The design and construction of street improvements required to serve a development shall be
made in accordance with Article 9 and Article 10 of this Code as well as any design standards
and specifications adopted by the Town. Street improvements shall include, but are not limited
to the following:
a.

Absent unique needs or characteristics of the development, improvements shall include
construction of full asphalt radii consistent with the classification of the future street and
necessary drainage improvements, in accordance with Town standards, for each
intersection with a perimeter street and/or improvements necessitated if the proposed
development creates lots with direct access to the perimeter streets, as determined by
the Community Development Director. If a traffic study is required and improvements in
addition to those set out above are required, the required improvements shall conform to
the traffic study.

b.

Curb, gutter and sidewalk improvements shall be constructed as part of minimum access
improvements when connecting directly to a street.

of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

b.

These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains,
which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood
hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.

Floodplain development permit required
Approval of a floodplain development permit pursuant to the requirements of Section 11.01 shall
be required prior to any development, as defined in Section 14.02, to ensure conformance to
the provisions and requirements of this Section.

5.

Methods of reducing flood losses
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Section uses the following methods:

6.

a.

Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in the times of
flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;

b.

Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

c.

Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective
barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;

d.

Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood
damage; and

e.

Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard
The special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a
scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study for Mesa County, Colorado
and Incorporated Areas," dated July 6, 2010, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
and/or Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and/or FBFM) and any revisions thereto, are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Section. These special flood
hazard areas identified by the FIS and attendant mapping are the minimum area of applicability
of this Section and may be supplemented by studies designated and approved by the Town.
The Floodplain Administrator shall keep a copy of the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), DFIRMs, FIRMs
and/or FBFMs on file and available for public inspection.

7.

Compliance
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered or have its use changed within the
special flood hazard area without full compliance with the terms of this Section and other
applicable regulations. Nothing herein shall prevent the Board of Trustees from taking such lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. These regulations meet the minimum
requirements as set forth by the Colorado Water Conservation Board and the National Flood
Insurance Program.

8.

Abrogation and greater restrictions
This Section is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. However, where the requirements of this Section and another ordinance,
easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.

9.

Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this Section, all provisions shall be:
11-5 | P a g e

Section 11.03 – Floodplain Regulations

a.

Considered as minimum requirements;

b.

Liberally construed in favor of the Town Board; and

c.

Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

10. Warning and disclaimer of liability
The degree of flood protection required by this Section is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater
floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes.
This Section does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Section shall not create liability
on the part of the Town or any officer or employee of the Town for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this Section or any administrative decision lawfully made under this Section.
11. Severability
This Section and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any
Section of this Section be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of this Section as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the
Section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
12. Designation of the Floodplain Administrator
The Town Administrator is hereby appointed as Floodplain Administrator to administer,
implement and enforce the provisions of this Section and other appropriate Sections of 44 C.F.R.
(National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management.
13. Duties and responsibilities of the Town's Floodplain Administrator shall include, but are not limited
to, the following:
a.

Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this
Section, including the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures and any floodproofing
certificate required by Section 11.01.

b.

Review, approve or deny all applications for floodplain development permits required by
this Section.

c.

Review floodplain development permit applications to determine whether a proposed
building site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe
from flooding.

d.

Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been
obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including Section 404
of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1334) from
which prior approval is required.

e.

Inspect all development at appropriate times during the period of construction to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this Section, including proper elevation of the structure.

f.

Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the special
flood hazard area (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the Floodplain Administrator shall make
the necessary interpretation.

g.

When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with this Section
11.03, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source,
in order to administer the general provisions of this Section 11.03.

h.

For waterways with base flood elevations for which a regulatory floodway has not been
designated, no new construction, substantial improvements or other development
(including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM,
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one-half (½) foot at any point within the
community.

i.

Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R., Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance
11-6 | P a g e

Section 11.03 – Floodplain Regulations

Program Regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE
and AH on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base
flood by more than one-half (½) foot, provided that the community first applies for a
conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (conditional letter of map revision), fulfills the
requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of Section 65.12 and
receives FEMA approval.
j.

Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state coordinating agency,
which is the Colorado Water Conservation Board, prior to any alteration or relocation of
a watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to FEMA.

k.

Ensure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any
watercourse is maintained.

14. Violations
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered
without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
Violation of the provisions of this Section by failure to comply with any of its requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions)
shall be a violation of this LDC. Any person who violates this Section or fails to comply with any
of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws
of the Town. See also Article 13. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Town from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
15. Floodplain development variance
Variance to the requirements of this Section may be approved pursuant to the requirements of
Section 11.02.

Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other
proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less, if not otherwise
provided pursuant to this Section 11.03.

C. Specific Standards
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth
in Section 11.03.A.6 or Section 11.01, the following provisions are required:
1.

Residential construction
New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest
floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated to one (1) foot above the
base flood elevation. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor,
including basement, shall be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer, architect
or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator.

2.

Nonresidential construction
With the exception of critical facilities, outlined in this Section, new construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have
the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), elevated to one (1)

walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having
the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
A registered Colorado professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural
design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in
this Section. Such certification shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.

3.

Enclosures
New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered Colorado
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

4.

a.

A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

b.

The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade.

c.

Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices,
provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

a.

Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with Section 11.03.B.1 of this LDC.

b.

All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH
and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or
11-8 | P a g e

Section 11.03 – Floodplain Regulations

subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision on which manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a
result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor
of the manufactured home, electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) are elevated to one (1) foot
above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
c.

5.

All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the
community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of the above Section shall be
elevated so that either:
i.

The lowest floor of the manufactured home, electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing
and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), are
one (1) foot above the base flood elevation; or

ii.

The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation
elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in
height above grade and is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.

Recreation vehicles
All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM
shall either:
a.

Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;

b.

Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or

c.

Meet the permit requirements of Section 11.01 and the elevation and anchoring
requirements for manufactured homes in Section 11.03.C.4.

A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently
attached additions.
6.

Prior approved activities
Any activity for which a floodplain development permit was issued by the Town or a CLOMR was
issued by FEMA prior to thirty (30) days after August 27, 2013, may be completed according to
the standards in place at the time of the permit or CLOMR issuance and will not be considered
in violation of this Section if it meets such standards.

D.

Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones)
Located within the special flood hazard area established in Section 11.03.A.6 are areas designated
as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of
one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding
or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
1.

Residential construction
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures must have the lowest
floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated above the highest
adjacent grade at least one (1) foot above the depth number specified in feet on the
community's FIRM (at least three [3] feet if no depth number is specified). Upon completion of
the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a
registered Colorado professional engineer, architect or land surveyor. Such certification shall be
submitted to the Floodplain Administrator.

2.

Nonresidential construction
With the exception of critical facilities, outlined in Section 11.03.H, all new construction and
substantial improvements of nonresidential structures must have the lowest floor (including
basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other
service facilities (including ductwork) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one
11-9 | P a g e

Section 11.03 – Floodplain Regulations

(1) foot above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least three [3]
feet if no depth number is specified) or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
designed so that the structure is watertight to at least one (1) foot above the base flood level
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads or effects of buoyancy. A
registered Colorado professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the
Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this Section 11.03 are satisfied.
3.
E.

Within Zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes are required to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

Floodways
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 11.03.A.6 are areas designated
as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters
which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following shall apply:

F.

1.

Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and
other development within the adopted regulatory floodway, unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed by a licensed Colorado professional
engineer and in accordance with standard engineering practice, that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase (requires a no-rise certification) in flood levels
within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

2.

If Section 11.03.D is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this Section.

3.

Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R., Chapter 1, Section 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance
Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway
that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first
applies for a CLOMR and floodway revision through FEMA.

Alteration of Watercourse
For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse within a special flood hazard area, the
following standards apply:
1.

Channelization and flow diversion projects shall appropriately consider issues of sediment
transport, erosion, deposition and channel migration and properly mitigate potential problems
through the project, as well as upstream and downstream of any improvement activity. A
detailed analysis of sediment transport and overall channel stability should be considered, when
appropriate, to assist in determining the most appropriate design.

2.

Channelization and flow diversion projects shall evaluate the residual 100-year floodplain.

3.

C. Any channelization or other stream alteration activity proposed by a project proponent must
be evaluated for its impact on the regulatory floodplain and be in compliance with all
applicable federal, state and local floodplain rules, regulations and ordinances.

4.

Any stream alteration activity shall be designed and sealed by a registered Colorado
professional engineer or certified professional hydrologist.

5.

All activities within the regulatory floodplain shall meet all applicable federal, state and Town
floodplain requirements and regulations.

6.

Within the regulatory floodway, stream alteration activities shall not be constructed unless the
project proponent demonstrates through a floodway analysis and report, sealed by a registered
Colorado professional engineer, that there is not more than a 0.00-foot rise in the proposed
conditions compared to existing conditions in the Floodway resulting from the project, otherwise
known as a no-rise certification, unless the community first applies for a CLOMR and floodway
revision in accordance with Section 11.03.E.

7.

Maintenance shall be required for any altered or relocated portions of watercourses so that the
flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

G. Properties Removed from the Floodplain by Fill
A floodplain development permit shall not be issued for the construction of a new structure or
addition to an existing structure on a property removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a
FEMA Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F), unless such new structure or addition complies
with the following:
11-10 | P a g e

Section 11.03 – Floodplain Regulations

1.

Residential construction
The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) must be elevated to
one (1) foot above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill.

2.

Nonresidential construction
The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) must be elevated to
one (1) foot above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill or, together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that the structure or addition is
watertight to at least one (1) foot above the base flood level that existed prior to the placement
of fill, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads or effects of
buoyancy.

H.

Standards for Critical Facilities
A critical facility is a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as
specified in Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado, that, if
flooded, may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services
and operations for the community at any time before, during and after a flood.
1.

Classification of critical facilities
It is the responsibility of the Town to identify and confirm that specific structures in their
community meet the following criteria:
Critical Facilities are classified under the following categories: (a) Essential services; (b)
Hazardous materials; (c) At-risk populations; and (d) Vital to restoring normal services.
a.

Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency
medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities
and transportation lifelines.
These facilities consist of:
i.

Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and
equipment storage and emergency operation centers);

ii.

Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having
emergency treatment functions and non-ambulatory surgical structures, but excluding
clinics, doctors' offices and non-urgent care medical structures that do not provide
these functions);

iii.

Designated emergency shelters;

iv. Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems,
satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio and other emergency warning
systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables and conduits);
v.

Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants,
substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers,
poles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines and service lines);
and

vi. Air transportation lifelines (airports - municipal and larger, helicopter pads and structures
serving emergency functions and associated infrastructure (aviation control towers, air
traffic control centers and emergency equipment aircraft hangars)).
Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP),
nonpotable water treatment and distribution systems and hydroelectric power-generating
plants and related appurtenances.
Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the Town that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not
be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant
facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an
intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities
are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of
11-11 | P a g e

Section 11.03 – Floodplain Regulations

this Article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide
service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall
be provided to the Town on an as-needed basis upon request.
b.

Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile,
flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials. These facilities may include:
i.

Chemical and
manufacturing);

pharmaceutical

plants

(chemical

plant,

pharmaceutical

ii.

Laboratories containing highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or waterreactive materials;

iii.

Refineries;

iv. Hazardous waste storage and disposal sites; and
v.

Aboveground gasoline or propane storage or sales centers.

Facilities shall be determined to be critical facilities if they produce or store materials in
excess of threshold limits. If the owner of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on file for
any chemicals stored or used in the workplace AND the chemical is stored in quantities
equal to or greater than the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) for that chemical, then that
facility shall be considered to be a critical facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is either: five
hundred (500) pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the three hundred fifty-six
(356) chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010), also known as Extremely Hazardous
Substances (EHS); or ten thousand (10,000) pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is
consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado
Department of Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29
C.F.R. § 1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation, "Designation,
Reportable Quantities, and Notification," 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010), and OSHA regulation,
"Occupational Safety and Health Standards," and 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010), are incorporated
herein by reference and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation
of this Section, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations.
Specific exemptions to this category include:
(a) Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing
hazardous materials intended for household use and agricultural products intended
for agricultural use.
(b) Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard
assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local
authority having land use jurisdiction) that a release of the subject hazardous
material does not pose a major threat to the public.
(c) Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage and distribution centers that do not
manufacture pharmaceutical products.
These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as critical
facilities under another category outlined in this Article.
c.

At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care and schools.
These facilities consist of:
i.

Elder care (nursing homes);

ii.

Congregate care serving twelve (12) or more individuals (day care and assisted living);

iii.

Public and private schools (preschools, K-12 schools), before-school and after-school
care serving twelve (12) or more children;

d.

Facilities vital to restoring normal services, including government operations.
These facilities consist of:
i.

Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and
inspection services, community administration and management, maintenance and
equipment centers);

ii.

Essential structures for public colleges and universities (dormitories, offices and
11-12 | P a g e

Section 11.04 – Definitions

classrooms only).
These facilities may be exempted if it is demonstrated to the Town that the facility is an
element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a
minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by
the same entity or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract),
the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are
compliant with this Section, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant
facilities will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of
ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the Town on an as-needed basis upon request.
2.

Protection for critical facilities
All new and substantially improved critical facilities and new additions to critical facilities located
within the special flood hazard area shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not
determined to be critical facilities. For the purposes of this Section, protection shall include one
(1) of the following:

3.

a.

Location outside the special flood hazard area; or

b.

Elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing of the structure, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities, to at least two (2) feet above the base flood elevation.

Ingress and egress for new critical facilities
New critical facilities shall, when practicable as determined by the Town, have continuous
noninundated access (ingress and egress for evacuation and emergency services) during a 100year flood event.

Section 11.04 Definitions
100-year flood means a flood having a recurrence interval that has a one-percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded during any given year (one-percent-annual-chance flood). The terms one-hundred-year flood
and one-percent-chance flood are synonymous with the term 100-year flood. The term does not imply that
the flood will necessarily happen once every one hundred (100) years.
100-year floodplain means the area of land susceptible to being inundated as a result of the occurrence of
a one-hundred-year flood.
500-year flood means a flood having a recurrence interval that has a 0.2-percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded during any given year (0.2-percent-chance annual flood). The term does not imply that the
flood will necessarily happen once every five hundred (500) years.
500-year floodplain means the area of land susceptible to being inundated as a result of the occurrence of
a five-hundred-year flood.
Alluvial fan flooding means a fan-shaped sediment deposit formed by a stream that flows from a steep
mountain valley or gorge onto a plain or the junction of a tributary stream with the main stream. Alluvial fans
contain active stream channels and boulder bars and recently abandoned channels. Alluvial fans are
predominantly formed by alluvial deposits and are modified by infrequent sheet flood, channel avulsions
and other stream processes.
Area of shallow flooding means a designated Zone AO or AH on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) with a one-percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to
three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent
or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard
Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the

ARTICLE 12 NONCONFORMITIES
Section 12.01 Intent
It is the intent of this LDC to permit nonconformities to continue until they are removed, or to incrementally
bring them into conformance but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are hereby declared to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the underlying district. It is further the intent of this LDC that
nonconformities not be enlarged, expanded or extended, nor be used as justification for the addition of
other structures or uses, except as may be specifically allowed in this LDC.

Section 12.02 Nonconforming Status
A. General
The use of land, use of a structure or a structure itself shall be deemed to have legal nonconforming
status when each of the following conditions are satisfied:
1.

The use, site or structure does not conform to the regulations prescribed in the district in which
such use, site or structure is located and was in existence and lawfully constructed, located and
operating prior to, and at the time of, the event that made such use or structure nonconforming.

2.

The event that made such use, site or structure nonconforming was one (1) of the following:

3.

B.

a.

Boundary adjustment of the Town;

b.

Adoption of this LDC or a previous zoning ordinance; or

c.

Amendment of this LDC.

operating since the time that the use or structure first became nonconforming without
abandonment, as abandonment is defined in Section 12.02.B of this LDC.

Abandonment
Whenever a legal nonconforming use or a conforming use in a nonconforming structure or a
conforming use on a nonconforming site is abandoned, all nonconforming rights shall cease and
the use of the premises shall henceforth conform to this LDC. Abandonment shall involve the actual
act of discontinuance regardless of the intent of the user or owner to discontinue a nonconforming
operation. Any legal nonconforming use that is discontinued for or that remains vacant for a period
of twelve (12) months shall be considered to have been abandoned. Any nonconforming use that
is moved from the premises shall be considered to have been abandoned.

C. Burden of Proof
The burden of establishing that a nonconforming use, structure or site lawfully exists under this LDC
shall, in all cases, be the owner's and not the Town's.

Section 12.03 Nonconforming Uses
A. Authority to Continue
Legal nonconforming uses may continue in accordance with the provisions of this LDC.
B.

Extensions
A legal nonconforming use shall not be extended or enlarged. This limitation shall be construed so
as to prevent:
1.

Enlargement of a legal nonconforming use by extension of the area of the structure which it
occupies, by extension of the structure itself or by extension of the site occupied by the
nonconforming use; or

2.

Occupancy of additional land area by the legal nonconforming use.

C. Relocation
A structure containing a legal nonconforming use shall not be moved to another location unless it
shall thereafter conform to the provisions of the district into which it is moved.
D.

Change in use
No use shall be changed to a conforming use until the Community Development Director has
12-1 | P a g e

Section 12.04 – Nonconforming Structures

determined that the requirements of the zone district will be met. If a legal nonconforming use is
changed to a conforming use for any period of time, it may not thereafter be changed back to any
nonconforming use.
E.

Discontinuance
If a legal nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months or
eighteen (18) accumulative months during any three-year period, then such use may not be
reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use must conform to the provisions of this LDC.

Section 12.04 Nonconforming Structures
A. Authority to Continue
Legal nonconforming structures, nonconforming due solely to failure to meet the dimensional
standards or performance standards pertaining to a structure and the criteria of the underlying zone
may be used for any purpose permitted in the zone, as long as the use is in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.
B.

Maintenance and Reconstruction
1.

Normal maintenance
Normal maintenance, repairs and alterations may be performed to permit continuation of a
legal nonconforming structure provided that no expansion of the nonconformity occurs.

2.

Reconstruction

Seventy-five percent (75%) of its replacement cost, as determined by the Community
Development Director, it shall only be reconstructed in compliance with the provisions of this
LDC.

C. Change of Use

D.

1.

Changes of use located in legal nonconforming structures that necessitate an increase in the
number of parking spaces shall be required to provide the difference between the required
parking for the prior use and that required for the proposed use in accordance with this LDC.

2.

Where this calculation results in the addition of less than five (5) spaces, no additional spaces
shall be required.

3.

Any additional parking area shall comply with all associated landscaping and drainage
requirements of this LDC.

4.

New outdoor operations/ storage/display uses require that the entire lot or parcel meet all
requirements of this LDC.

Extensions
A legal nonconforming structure shall not be extended by an enlargement or expansion that
increases its nonconformity with the following exceptions:
1.

Permitted extensions
A legal nonconforming structure may be extended or altered in a manner that does not increase
its nonconformity.

2.

Americans with Disabilities Act
An extension to a legal nonconforming structure may be permitted by the Community
Development Director to comply with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),
provided that it is demonstrated that the only way to comply with the Act would be through an
extension which increases the structure's legal nonconformity and that the extension is the
minimum necessary to comply with the Act.

E.

Relocation
A legal nonconforming structure shall not be moved to another location unless it shall thereafter
conform to the provisions of the district into which it is moved.

nonconformity occurs, unless the expansion occurs in conformance of this Section.

2.

Expansion
Additions to structures or additional paving, parking or outdoor storage on legal nonconforming
sites shall require correction of existing nonconforming parking, landscaping and
screening/buffering.
a.

Redevelopment or expansion which results in a sixty-five percent (65%) or greater increase
of the gross square footage of the existing structure, outdoor operations/ storage/display,
paving or parking areas or combination of these requires the entire property to meet all
of the landscaping, screening/buffering and off-site public improvements requirements of
this LDC.

b.

Redevelopment or expansion which would result in less that sixty-five percent (65%)
increase of the gross square footage of the existing structure, outdoor operations/
storage/display, paving or parking areas shall require a corresponding percentage
increase in compliance for landscaping, screening/buffering and off-site public
improvements requirements of this LDC until the site achieves one hundred percent (100%)
compliance.

c.

Redevelopment or expansion that necessitates an increase in the number of parking
spaces shall be required to provide fifty percent (50%) of the required parking spaces for
the additional floor area in accordance with this LDC. The additional parking area shall
comply with all associated landscaping and drainage requirements of this LDC.

d.

The conversion of legal nonconforming commercial and/or residential structures and sites
to condominiums shall not require that the site be brought into compliance with parking,
lighting and landscaping requirements of this LDC.

e.

Properties that are physically constrained from complying with these provisions shall
comply to the maximum extent practicable as determined by the Community
Development Director using the following criteria:
i.

Is the general intent of the requirement being met by the applicant, such as

Section 12.06 – Nonconforming Lots of Record

Section 12.06 Nonconforming Lots of Record
A. Authority to Utilize

B.

1.

Any permitted structure may be developed on a lot of record which is nonconforming as to
minimum lot area, provided that it can be located on the lot so that all other dimensional
standards are met, or a variance from said dimensional standards is obtained pursuant to
Section 4.12, Variance, and provided that the development complies with all other applicable
standards of this LDC.

2.

If two (2) or more adjoining and vacant lots of record are in one (1) ownership when this LDC is
adopted, or at any time after the adoption of this LDC, and such lots individually do not meet
the dimensional requirements of this LDC for the district in which such lots are located, then such
group of lots shall be considered as a single lot and therefore the provisions of Section 12.06.A.1
above do not apply.

Conforming Lots
No lot of record that is conforming as to minimum lot size or minimum lot frontage as of the effective
date of this LDC may be reduced in size or subdivided in such a way that it creates a nonconforming
lot or causes any structure or use to become nonconforming.
1.

Lot reduction shall not increase nonconformity
No lot of record that is nonconforming as to minimum lot area as of the effective date of this
LDC may be reduced in size in such a way that its nonconformity would increase, or that causes
the nonconformity of any use to increase.

2.

Nonconforming lots shall not be subdivided
No lot of record that is nonconforming as to minimum lot area as of the effective date of this
LDC may be subdivided.
